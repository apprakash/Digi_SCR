Service Law – Judicial Service – Every judicial officer is likely to commit mistake of some kind or the other in passing orders in the initial stage of his service, which a mature judicial officer would not do – However, if the orders are passed without there being any corrupt motive, the same should be over-looked by the High Court and proper guidance should be provided to him. Service Law – Judicial Service – Merely because a wrong order has been passed by the appellant-judicial officer or the action taken by him could have been different, this does not warrant initiation of disciplinary proceedings against the judicial officer. Service Law – Judicial service – Negligence vis-a-vis misconduct – On facts, appellant-judicial officer, while passing the bail order, may have been guilty of negligence in the sense that he did not carefully go through the case file and did not take notice of  the order of the High Court which was on his file – This negligence cannot be treated to be misconduct.

Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973: s.319 – Investigating Agency conducted investigation wherein it found that the appellants were not present at the place of occurrence – As the appellants were in custody, SHO filed applications before the Magistrate on 1.9.2016 and 28.10.2016 submitting that after investigation since no evidence was found against the appellants, therefore, they may be discharged/released – Magistrate directed release of the appellants – Application filed by complainant under s.319 to summon the appellants categorically stating that the appellants were present at the time of the incident – Trial court summoned the appellants to face trial – Submission that once the appellants were discharged by the Magistrate on an application submitted by the Investigating Officer/SHO, therefore, thereafter it was not open to the Magistrate to summon the accused to face the trial in exercise of power under s.319 – Held: The submission is not tenable – Orders dated 01.09.2016 and 28.10.2016 cannot be said to be the orders discharging the accused – If the applications submitted by the Investigating Officer/SHO and the orders passed thereon are considered, those were the applications to discharge/release the appellants from custody as at that stage the appellants were in judicial custody – Therefore, as such, those orders cannot be said to be the orders of discharge in stricto sensu – Those were the orders discharging the appellants from custody – Under the circumstances, the submission on behalf of the accused that as they were discharged by the Magistrate and therefore it was not open to the Magistrate to exercise the power under s.319 of the CrPC and to summon the appellants to face the trial, cannot be accepted. Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973: Closure report – Procedure to be followed before accepting closure report – Held: Before accepting the closure report, the Magistrate is bound to issue notice to the complainant/original informant and the complainant/ original informant is required to be given an opportunity to submit the protest application and, thereafter, after giving an opportunity to the complainant/original informant, the Magistrate may either accept the closure report or may not accept the closure report and direct to proceed further against those persons for whom the closure report was submitted.",

Sentence / Sentencing – Death Sentence – Evolution of principles and norms – Discussed – Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 – ss.235 and 354. Sentence / Sentencing – Death Sentence – Rarest of rare doctrine – Effect, if any, of death sentence being awarded and maintained only in extreme cases – Held: Even though rarest of rare doctrine and its accompanying principles, as enunciated and explained in Bachan Singh and Machhi Singh cases, have been almost uniformly applied by Courts in the country while dealing with the question of sentencing when the statute provides for death penalty; and over the time, even the proposition of larger/longer term of actual imprisonment with no remission or curtailed remission has also evolved but, it has never been the effort of the Courts to somehow make the punishment of death sentence redundant and non-existent for all practical purposes – The quest for justice in such cases, with death sentence being awarded and maintained only in extreme cases, does not mean that the matter would be approached and examined in the manner that death sentence has be avoided, even if the matter indeed calls for such a punishment – The judicial process would be compromising on its objectivity if the approach is to nullify the statutory provision carrying death sentence as an alternative punishment for major offences (like that of s.302 IPC), even after it has passed muster of judicial scrutiny and has been held not unconstitutional – The pursuit in collecting mitigating circumstances could also not be taken up with any notion or idea that somehow, some factor be found; or if not found, be deduced anyhow so that the sentence of death be forsaken – Such an approach would be unrealistic, unwarranted and rather not upholding the rule of law – Rule of law. Sentence / Sentencing – Death Sentence – Post-conviction conduct – Relevance – Held: Courts have refrained from awarding or approving death sentence even in cases of gruesome killings, essentially on the premise that even a semblance of probability of reformation of the convict ought to be given a chance, rather than awarding capital punishment, which is of irretrievable nature – In this regard, the jail conduct of the convict carries its own bearing and relevance in the overall consideration; and the Supreme Court has leaned in favour of commuting the sentence of death to that of imprisonment for life in case of unblemished jail conduct, even if the crime itself had been of gruesome or abhorrent nature. Sentence / Sentencing – Psychological evaluation report – Report on likelihood of reformation and rehabilitation – When may be called for – Held: In appropriate cases, after conviction, the Court may call for report to determine whether the accused could be reformed or rehabilitated; and it would depend on the facts and circumstances of each case – There cannot be any universal formula for calling for such a report – In the present case, where the appellant-convict was incessantly indulged in criminal activities before the crime in question; carried out gruesome deeds of the present crime; was further involved in questionable jail conduct, including quarrelling with a fellow inmate and earning 7 days’ punishment; and then also involved in murder of another jail inmate, calling for any further report of the likelihood of reformation and rehabilitation of the appellant could be proposed only if the judicial process is determined to annul the death sentence altogether, by finding one way or the other to avoid the same in every case – Such an approach would be counter-productive to the entire system of maintenance of order in the society and would strike at the roots of the rule of law – In the circumstances of the present case, the suggestions about calling for any so-called psychological evaluation report could only be termed as impractical and unrealistic and could only be rejected. Sentence / Sentencing – Sentencing principles – Crime and criminal tests – Aggravating and Mitigating circumstances – Discussed. Criminal jurisprudence – Case of circumstantial evidence – Theory of residual doubt – If available for the purpose of sentencing – Held: In a case based on circumstantial evidence, the conclusion of guilt is recorded only after the circumstances are found to be forming an unbreakable chain, so consistent as to rule out any other hypothesis except the guilt of the accused – These being stringent norms, as followed consistently by the Courts based on the panchsheel principles expounded in Sharad Birdhichand Sarda, and requirement being of the proof of the case beyond reasonable doubt, theoretically there is no scope for any ‘residual doubt’ operating even in the cases of circumstantial evidence – The cases in which theory of residual doubt has at all been referred, had been standing on their own facts, where alternative to death sentence was considered appropriate – However, while taking up the matter for sentencing, it is not expected to reopen the chain of circumstantial evidence to find any weak link which may fall in the category of residual doubt – If at all any such doubt is reasonably existing, the very basis of conviction would be in question – After the final conclusion on the guilt and after pronouncing conviction, no concept of residual doubt as such is available for the purpose of sentencing – Sentence / Sentencing.",

        "HeadNote": "Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 – Or.VIII, r.6-A – Counter\u0002claim by defendant – Bombay High Court Rules – r.95 – Suit for specific performance filed by respondent-plaintiff – Notice of motion moved by the appellant-defendant to take the belatedly filed counter\u0002claim on record, allowed by Single Judge – Order set aside by Division Bench – On appeal, held: Rules of procedure are intended to subserve the cause of justice rather than to punish the parties in conduct of their case – The counter-claim in question could not have been removed out of consideration merely because it was presented after a long time since after filing of the written statement – On facts, neither the requirements of Or.VIII, r.6-A or r.95 of the Rules nor the principles enunciated and explained in Ashok Kumar Kalra v. Wing Cdr. Surendra Agnihotri and Ors. reported as [2019] 17 SCR 214 operate as a bar over the prayer of the appellant for taking the belatedly filed counter-claim on record, which was indeed filed before framing of issues – Further, impact of the order dtd.26.02.21 passed by Supreme Court (in relation to the incidental proceedings pertaining to the suit) on the procedural aspect concerning pleadings has clearly been that existence of the counter-claim on record was taken by this Court as a fait accompli, and this order left a little, rather nil, scope for upsetting the existing pleadings – Also, in this order, Supreme Court emphasised for expeditious proceedings – There was no reason for re-opening of the question relating to the filing of counter-claim after the said order – Even when the said order was placed before the Division Bench, it did not consider its purport and meaning as also its impact on the suit proceedings and on the question of filing of counter-claim and proceeded in a rather cursory manner in directing reconsideration of the prayer of the appellant for taking the counter-claim on record – It did not consider the relevant aspects of the proceedings in the suit and the law applicable thereto as also without considering the likely impact of  its order on the proceedings, which had already taken place and which were under progress – Order passed by the Division Bench is set aside while that of the Single Judge is restored – Pleadings.",
