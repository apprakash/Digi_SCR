reversed the findings of the courts below andheld that the property was part of the impartible estate governedby the rule of primogeniture– Held: An estate even if inherited andancestral, partition of which is prohibited by custom and successionwhereto is generally by the rule of primogeniture is referred to asan ‘impartible estate’ – As per the custom relating to impartibleestates and the rule of primogeniture, the Raja or Ruler of aprincely state would not hold the estate as the karta or coparcener,but as the absolute owner and the estate would be impartible –On the death of the Ruler, the succession to the rulership, and theimpartible estate, was not under the Mitakshara law ofsurvivorship but by the rule of primogeniture – In the present case,inheritance of the property post the death of the then Maharajaof the State of Maihar by the new Ruler including ‘BNS’ byapplication of the rule of primogeniture indicates that it was treatedas a State or sovereign property– Property was a part of theimpartible property i.e., though ancestral was not a part of the coparcenary property, but was a part of the estate of the sovereignRuler, ‘BNS’ – Final findings of the High Court,

estate, albeit it isdifferent from the ordinary rule of succession under theMitakshara Hindu law where all sons of the father are entitled toequal share in his estate, for the law of succession when the ruleof primogeniture applies, is that the first-born son succeeds to theentire estate to the exclusion of the other sons.Hindu Law – Property – Impartible estate and the rule ofprimogeniture – Origin of – Discussed.Hindu Law – Succession to impartible estate – Rights ofcoparceners, if any – Held: An impartible estate is clothed withthe incidents of self-acquired and separate property – Such estateeven if inherited and ancestral, is not held by the coparcenary asa part of the coparcenary property, as the coparceners or membersof the joint Hindu family do not have the right to partition or rightto restrain alienation – Thus, any property belonging to the Ruleras a sovereign, which would devolve on succession by survivorshipby application of the rule of the primogeniture, would not bearan incidence of a coparcenary property.Hindu Succession Act, 1956 – ss. 4, 5(ii) – Continuation ofthe custom of impartibility and the rule of primogeniture post thecovenants and merger – Held: s.5(ii) is an exception to s.4 andprotects application of terms of any covenant or agreement enteredinto by the Ruler of any Indian State with the Government of Indiaor the terms of any enactment passed before commencement of theSuccession Act as per which the estate would descend to a singleheir – Further, ratio of the Constitution Bench in Vir Rajendra Singh is a binding precedent for it recognizes the personal law ofsuccession of the Rulers and therefore, the rule/custom ofprimogeniture applicable to impart ible estates belonging toerstwhile Rulers of the princely states – This custom/rule was notabrogated with the loss of sovereignty that the Rulers had forgonewith the signing of the merger agreement – Law of the land ispervious to the rule of primogeniture – Constitution

wife for her son– Elder son sold the property in question to the appellant in 1968– Impugned judgment inter alia held that the property was part ofthe impartible estate governed by the rule of primogeniture –Appellants contended that the property being leasehold Nazul plotowned by the superior lessor, i.e. State of U.P., could not be treatedas a sovereign property in the hands of ‘BNS’ but, should be treatedas coparcenary property belonging to the joint Hindu family –Held: Rejected – Succession on death of ‘BNS’ had opened on13.10.68, which is before Art.362 relating to the rights andprivileges of the Indian Rulers was repealed – ‘BNS’ took over asa Ruler of the State of Maihar in the pre-independence era whenthe Rulers, though subject to British supremacy, were treated

Puttaswamy (Aadhaar-5) pronounced thenature of the impugned enactment without first delineating thescope of Art.110(1) and principles for interpretation or therepercussions of such process – The majority dictum in K.S.Puttaswamy (Aadhaar-5) did not substantially discuss the effect ofthe word ‘only’ in Art.110(1) and offers little guidance on therepercussions of a finding when some of the provisions of anenactment passed as a ‘Money Bill’ do not conform to Art. 110 (1)(a) (b) – Without expressing a firm and final opinion, the analysisin K.S. Puttaswamy (Aadhaar-5) made its application difficult tothe present case and raises a potential conflict between thejudgments of Coordinate Benches – Being a Bench of equalstrength as that in K.S. Puttaswamy (Aadhaar-5), the batch ofmatters directed to be referred to the Larger Bench.Tribunals – Finance Act, 2017 – S. 184 – Constitutionalityof s. 184 on account of excessive delegations – Held s.184 doesnot suffer from excessive delegations of legislative functions asthere are adequate principles to guide framing of delegatedlegislation, which would include the binding dictums of theSupreme Court – The objects of the parent enactments as well asthe law laid down by the Supreme Court in R.K. Jain, L. ChandraKumar, R. Gandhi, Madras Bar Association and Gujarat UrjaVikas undoubtedly bind the delegate and mandatorily requires thedelegate u/s. 184 to act strictly in conformity with these decisionsand the objects of delegated legislation stipulated in the statutes. Tribunals – The Tribunal, Appellate Tribunal and otherAuthorities (Qualifications, Experience and other Conditions ofService of Members) Rules, 2017 – Conformity of the Rules withthe judicial principles inherent in the Constitutional scheme asestablished by the Supreme Court – Held: The composition of thesearch-cum-Selection Committees under the Rules amounts toexcessive interference of the Executive in appointment of membersand presiding offices of statutory Tribunals and it is detrimentalto the independence of Judiciary – In addition to this, there hasbeen a blatant dilution of judicial character in appointmentswhereby candidates without any judicial experience are prescribedto be eligible for adjudicatory posts such as that of the presidingOfficer – Therefore, the Rules have an effect of dilution of thejudicial character in adjudicatory positions – Further, earlierremoval of members or presiding officer was done after an enquiryby the Supreme Court Judges and with necessary consultation withthe Chief Justice of India, under the present Rules it is permissiblefor the Central Government to appoint an enquiry Committee forremoval of any presiding officer or member on its own – TheMembers and Presiding Officers of Tribunals cannot be removedwithout either the concurrence of the Judiciary or in the mannerspecified in the Constitution for Constitutional Court Judges – Also,there must be uniform age of superannuation for all members inall the Tribunals, the Rules demonstrate disparity in age ofsuperannuation of Members and Chairpersons/Presiding Officersof different Tribunals – Furthermore, there is inconsistency withinthe Rules with regard to the tenure prescribed for the Members ofTribunals insofar as a fixed tenure of three years for both directappointments from the Bar and appointment of retired judicialofficers or judges of High Court or Supreme Court – It is alsodiscriminatory to the extent that it attempts to create equalitybetween unequal classes – Therefore, the Rules suffer from variousinfirmities and are contrary to the Parent enactment and theprinciples envisaged in the Constitution, resultantly, directed to bestruck down in entirety.Tribunals – Finance Act, 2017 – Whether there should be asingle Nodal Agency for administration of all Tribunals – Held: Itmay not be very crucial as to which Ministry or Departmentperforms the duties of Nodal Agency for a Tribunal, but what is of utmost importance is that the Tribunal should not be expectedto look towards such Nodal Agency for its day to day requirements– There must be a direction to allocate adequate and sufficientfunds for each Tribunal to make it self-sufficient and selfsustainableauthority for all intents and purposes.Tribunals – A Judicial Impact Assessment of all tribunals inIndia – Need for – Held: It was directed in Salem Advocate BarAssociation (II) v. Union of India for a Committee to be constitutedto assess the need for Judicial Impact Assessment – Pursuantthereto, Jagannadha Rao Committee Report was submitted, itsuggested that legislature must analyse the budgetary requirementof the staff, additional expenditure arising out of the new casesconsequent to the enactment, the number of Civil and CriminalCases expected to arise from the new enactment, the requirementof Judges etc. – The legislature has not conformed to the opinionof the Supreme Court with respect to ‘Judicial Impact Assessment’and thus, has not made any attempt to assess the ramifications ofthe Finance Act, 2017 – Therefore, the Union of India directed tocarry out Financial Impact Assessment in respect of all theTribunals referable to ss. 158 to 182 of the Finance Act, 2017 andundertake an exercise to assess the need based requirements andmake available sufficient resources for each Tribunal establishedby the Parliament.Tribunals – Judges of Tribunals set up by Acts of Parliamentunder Arts. 323-A and 323-B of the Constitution equated in ‘Rank’and ‘Status’ with constitutional functionaries – Held: There can beno doubt that executive action cannot confer status equivalent tothat either Supreme Court or High Court Judges on any memberor head of any Tribunal or other judicial fora – Tribunals are notsubstitutes of Superior Courts and are only supplemental to them– Hence, the status of members of such Tribunals cannot beequated with that of the sitting Judges of Constitutional Courts.Tribunals – Direct Statutory appeals from Tribunals to theSupreme Court – Consideration of – Held: Such statutory appealstake away the inherent ability of the Supreme Court, as envisagedin the Constitution, to regulate cases before it by confining itsconsideration to cases involving the most egregious of wrongs and/or having the greatest impact on public interest – It is evident thatSupreme Court has lost its original character owing to the routine hearing of appeals through invocation of the discretionaryjurisdiction u/Art. 136 – For the discharge of constitutionalfunctions of deliberating on substantial questions of law, answeringconstitutional questions and resolving other issues of great Publicimportance, it is essential that Supreme Court has adequate timeto apply its mind and consider matters in depth the practice ofbringing every second case before the Supreme Court u/Art. 136must be deprecated – Therefore, the Union of India in consultationwith either the Law Commission or any other expert body revisitsuch provisions under various enactments providing for directappeals to the Supreme Court against orders of Tribunals, andinstead provide appeals to Division Benches of the High Courts,if at all necessary.Tribunals – Amalgamation of Existing Tribunals and settingup of Benches – Need for – Held: The ‘importance’ in distributionof case-load and inconsistencies in nature, location andfunctioning of Tribunals require urgent attention – It is essentialthat after conducting a Judicial Impact Assessment, Tribunals beamalgamed with others dealing with similar areas of law, to ensureeffective utilisation of resources and to facilitate access to justice– Therefore, the Union Government directed to carry out anappropriate exercise for amalgamation of existing Tribunalsadopting the test of homogeneity of the subject matters to be dealtwith and thereafter constitute adequate number of BenchesCommensurate with the existing and anticipated volume of work.",

Tribunals – The Tribunal, Appellate Tribunal and otherAuthorities (Qualifications, Experience and other Conditions ofService of Members) Rules, 2017 – Conformity of the Rules withthe judicial principles inherent in the Constitutional scheme asestablished by the Supreme Court – Held: The composition of thesearch-cum-Selection Committees under the Rules amounts toexcessive interference of the Executive in appointment of membersand presiding offices of statutory Tribunals and it is detrimentalto the independence of Judiciary – In addition to this, there hasbeen a blatant dilution of judicial character in appointmentswhereby candidates without any judicial experience are prescribedto be eligible for adjudicatory posts such as that of the presidingOfficer – Therefore, the Rules have an effect of dilution of thejudicial character in adjudicatory positions – Further, earlierremoval of members or presiding officer was done after an enquiryby the Supreme Court Judges and with necessary consultation withthe Chief Justice of India, under the present Rules it is permissiblefor the Central Government to appoint an enquiry Committee forremoval of any presiding officer or member on its own – TheMembers and Presiding Officers of Tribunals cannot be removedwithout either the concurrence of the Judiciary or in the mannerspecified in the Constitution for Constitutional Court Judges – Also,there must be uniform age of superannuation for all members inall the Tribunals, the Rules demonstrate disparity in age ofsuperannuation of Members and Chairpersons/Presiding Officersof different Tribunals – Furthermore, there is inconsistency withinthe Rules with regard to the tenure prescribed for the Members ofTribunals insofar as a fixed tenure of three years for both directappointments from the Bar and appointment of retired judicialofficers or judges of High Court or Supreme Court – It is alsodiscriminatory to the extent that it attempts to create equalitybetween unequal classes – Therefore, the Rules suffer from variousinfirmities and are contrary to the Parent enactment and theprinciples envisaged in the Constitution, resultantly, directed to bestruck down in entirety.Tribunals – Finance Act, 2017 – Whether there should be asingle Nodal Agency for administration of all Tribunals – Held: Itmay not be very crucial as to which Ministry or Departmentperforms the duties of Nodal Agency for a Tribunal, but what is of utmost importance is that the Tribunal should not be expectedto look towards such Nodal Agency for its day to day requirements– There must be a direction to allocate adequate and sufficientfunds for each Tribunal to make it self-sufficient and selfsustainableauthority for all intents and purposes.Tribunals – A Judicial Impact Assessment of all tribunals inIndia – Need for – Held: It was directed in Salem Advocate BarAssociation (II) v. Union of India for a Committee to be constitutedto assess the need for Judicial Impact Assessment – Pursuantthereto, Jagannadha Rao Committee Report was submitted, itsuggested that legislature must analyse the budgetary requirementof the staff, additional expenditure arising out of the new casesconsequent to the enactment, the number of Civil and CriminalCases expected to arise from the new enactment, the requirementof Judges etc. – The legislature has not conformed to the opinionof the Supreme Court with respect to ‘Judicial Impact Assessment’and thus, has not made any attempt to assess the ramifications ofthe Finance Act, 2017 – Therefore, the Union of India directed tocarry out Financial Impact Assessment in respect of all theTribunals referable to ss. 158 to 182 of the Finance Act, 2017 andundertake an exercise to assess the need based requirements andmake available sufficient resources for each Tribunal establishedby the Parliament.Tribunals – Judges of Tribunals set up by Acts of Parliamentunder Arts. 323-A and 323-B of the Constitution equated in ‘Rank’and ‘Status’ with constitutional functionaries – Held: There can beno doubt that executive action cannot confer status equivalent tothat either Supreme Court or High Court Judges on any memberor head of any Tribunal or other judicial fora – Tribunals are notsubstitutes of Superior Courts and are only supplemental to them– Hence, the status of members of such Tribunals cannot beequated with that of the sitting Judges of Constitutional Courts.Tribunals – Direct Statutory appeals from Tribunals to theSupreme Court – Consideration of – Held: Such statutory appealstake away the inherent ability of the Supreme Court, as envisagedin the Constitution, to regulate cases before it by confining itsconsideration to cases involving the most egregious of wrongs and/or having the greatest impact on public interest – It is evident thatSupreme Court has lost its original character owing to the routine hearing of appeals through invocation of the discretionaryjurisdiction u/Art. 136 – For the discharge of constitutionalfunctions of deliberating on substantial questions of law, answeringconstitutional questions and resolving other issues of great Publicimportance, it is essential that Supreme Court has adequate timeto apply its mind and consider matters in depth the practice ofbringing every second case before the Supreme Court u/Art. 136must be deprecated – Therefore, the Union of India in consultationwith either the Law Commission or any other expert body revisitsuch provisions under various enactments providing for directappeals to the Supreme Court against orders of Tribunals, andinstead provide appeals to Division Benches of the High Courts,if at all necessary.Tribunals – Amalgamation of Existing Tribunals and settingup of Benches – Need for – Held: The ‘importance’ in distributionof case-load and inconsistencies in nature, location andfunctioning of Tribunals require urgent attention – It is essentialthat after conducting a Judicial Impact Assessment, Tribunals beamalgamed with others dealing with similar areas of law, to ensureeffective utilisation of resources and to facilitate access to justice– Therefore, the Union Government directed to carry out anappropriate exercise for amalgamation of existing Tribunalsadopting the test of homogeneity of the subject matters to be dealtwith and thereafter constitute adequate number of BenchesCommensurate with the existing and anticipated volume of work.",

Puttaswamy (Aadhaar-5) pronounced thenature of the impugned enactment without first delineating thescope of Art.110(1) and principles for interpretation or therepercussions of such process – The majority dictum in K.S.Puttaswamy (Aadhaar-5) did not substantially discuss the effect ofthe word ‘only’ in Art.110(1) and offers little guidance on therepercussions of a finding when some of the provisions of anenactment passed as a ‘Money Bill’ do not conform to Art. 110 (1)(a) (b) – Without expressing a firm and final opinion, the analysisin K.S. Puttaswamy (Aadhaar-5) made its application difficult tothe present case and raises a potential conflict between thejudgments of Coordinate Benches – Being a Bench of equalstrength as that in K.S. Puttaswamy (Aadhaar-5), the batch ofmatters directed to be referred to the Larger Bench.Tribunals – Finance Act, 2017 – S. 184 – Constitutionalityof s. 184 on account of excessive delegations – Held s.184 doesnot suffer from excessive delegations of legislative functions asthere are adequate principles to guide framing of delegatedlegislation, which would include the binding dictums of theSupreme Court – The objects of the parent enactments as well asthe law laid down by the Supreme Court in R.K. Jain, L. ChandraKumar, R. Gandhi, Madras Bar Association and Gujarat UrjaVikas undoubtedly bind the delegate and mandatorily requires thedelegate u/s. 184 to act strictly in conformity with these decisionsand the objects of delegated legislation stipulated in the statutes. Tribunals – The Tribunal, Appellate Tribunal and otherAuthorities (Qualifications, Experience and other Conditions ofService of Members) Rules, 2017 – Conformity of the Rules withthe judicial principles inherent in the Constitutional scheme asestablished by the Supreme Court – Held: The composition of thesearch-cum-Selection Committees under the Rules amounts toexcessive interference of the Executive in appointment of membersand presiding offices of statutory Tribunals and it is detrimentalto the independence of Judiciary – In addition to this, there hasbeen a blatant dilution of judicial character in appointmentswhereby candidates without any judicial experience are prescribedto be eligible for adjudicatory posts such as that of the presidingOfficer – Therefore, the Rules have an effect of dilution of thejudicial character in adjudicatory positions – Further, earlierremoval of members or presiding officer was done after an enquiryby the Supreme Court Judges and with necessary consultation withthe Chief Justice of India, under the present Rules it is permissiblefor the Central Government to appoint an enquiry Committee forremoval of any presiding officer or member on its own – TheMembers and Presiding Officers of Tribunals cannot be removedwithout either the concurrence of the Judiciary or in the mannerspecified in the Constitution for Constitutional Court Judges – Also,there must be uniform age of superannuation for all members inall the Tribunals, the Rules demonstrate disparity in age ofsuperannuation of Members and Chairpersons/Presiding Officersof different Tribunals – Furthermore, there is inconsistency withinthe Rules with regard to the tenure prescribed for the Members ofTribunals insofar as a fixed tenure of three years for both directappointments from the Bar and appointment of retired judicialofficers or judges of High Court or Supreme Court – It is alsodiscriminatory to the extent that it attempts to create equalitybetween unequal classes – Therefore, the Rules suffer from variousinfirmities and are contrary to the Parent enactment and theprinciples envisaged in the Constitution, resultantly, directed to bestruck down in entirety.Tribunals – Finance Act, 2017 – Whether there should be asingle Nodal Agency for administration of all Tribunals – Held: Itmay not be very crucial as to which Ministry or Departmentperforms the duties of Nodal Agency for a Tribunal, but what is of utmost importance is that the Tribunal should not be expectedto look towards such Nodal Agency for its day to day requirements– There must be a direction to allocate adequate and sufficientfunds for each Tribunal to make it self-sufficient and selfsustainableauthority for all intents and purposes.Tribunals – A Judicial Impact Assessment of all tribunals inIndia – Need for – Held: It was directed in Salem Advocate BarAssociation (II) v. Union of India for a Committee to be constitutedto assess the need for Judicial Impact Assessment – Pursuantthereto, Jagannadha Rao Committee Report was submitted, itsuggested that legislature must analyse the budgetary requirementof the staff, additional expenditure arising out of the new casesconsequent to the enactment, the number of Civil and CriminalCases expected to arise from the new enactment, the requirementof Judges etc. – The legislature has not conformed to the opinionof the Supreme Court with respect to ‘Judicial Impact Assessment’and thus, has not made any attempt to assess the ramifications ofthe Finance Act, 2017 – Therefore, the Union of India directed tocarry out Financial Impact Assessment in respect of all theTribunals referable to ss. 158 to 182 of the Finance Act, 2017 andundertake an exercise to assess the need based requirements andmake available sufficient resources for each Tribunal establishedby the Parliament.Tribunals – Judges of Tribunals set up by Acts of Parliamentunder Arts. 323-A and 323-B of the Constitution equated in ‘Rank’and ‘Status’ with constitutional functionaries – Held: There can beno doubt that executive action cannot confer status equivalent tothat either Supreme Court or High Court Judges on any memberor head of any Tribunal or other judicial fora – Tribunals are notsubstitutes of Superior Courts and are only supplemental to them– Hence, the status of members of such Tribunals cannot beequated with that of the sitting Judges of Constitutional Courts.Tribunals – Direct Statutory appeals from Tribunals to theSupreme Court – Consideration of – Held: Such statutory appealstake away the inherent ability of the Supreme Court, as envisagedin the Constitution, to regulate cases before it by confining itsconsideration to cases involving the most egregious of wrongs and/or having the greatest impact on public interest – It is evident thatSupreme Court has lost its original character owing to the routine hearing of appeals through invocation of the discretionaryjurisdiction u/Art. 136 – For the discharge of constitutionalfunctions of deliberating on substantial questions of law, answeringconstitutional questions and resolving other issues of great Publicimportance, it is essential that Supreme Court has adequate timeto apply its mind and consider matters in depth the practice ofbringing every second case before the Supreme Court u/Art. 136must be deprecated – Therefore, the Union of India in consultationwith either the Law Commission or any other expert body revisitsuch provisions under various enactments providing for directappeals to the Supreme Court against orders of Tribunals, andinstead provide appeals to Division Benches of the High Courts,if at all necessary.Tribunals – Amalgamation of Existing Tribunals and settingup of Benches – Need for – Held: The ‘importance’ in distributionof case-load and inconsistencies in nature, location andfunctioning of Tribunals require urgent attention – It is essentialthat after conducting a Judicial Impact Assessment, Tribunals beamalgamed with others dealing with similar areas of law, to ensureeffective utilisation of resources and to facilitate access to justice– Therefore, the Union Government directed to carry out anappropriate exercise for amalgamation of existing Tribunalsadopting the test of homogeneity of the subject matters to be dealtwith and thereafter constitute adequate number of BenchesCommensurate with the existing and anticipated volume of work.",

Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 – National CompanyLaw Tribunal- Adjudicating Authority and National Company LawAppellate Tribunal-Appellate Tribunal under – Jurisdiction of, quaresolution approved by Committee of Creditors – Held: AdjudicatingAuthority’s jurisdiction is circumscribed by s. 30(2) and AppellateTribunal’s jurisdiction is circumscribed by s. 32 rw s. 61(3) -Adjudicating Authority cannot interfere on merits with thecommercial decision taken by the Committee of Creditors, thelimited judicial review available is to see that the Committee ofCreditors has taken into account the fact that the corporate debtorneeds to keep going as a going concern during the insolvencyresolution process; that it needs to maximise the value of its assets;and that the interests of all stakeholders including operationalcreditors has been taken care of - If the Adjudicating Authorityfinds, on a given set of facts, that the said parameters have notbeen kept in view, it may send a resolution plan back to theCommittee of Creditors to re-submit such plan after satisfying thesaid parameters - Reasons given by the Committee of Creditorswhile approving a resolution plan may be looked at by theAdjudicating Authority only from this point of view, and once it issatisfied that Committee of Creditors has paid attention to thesekey features, it must then pass the resolution plan, other thingsbeing equal.Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 – Secured andunsecured creditors – Equality principle – Held: Secured andunsecured financial creditors are differentiated when it comes toamounts to be paid under a resolution plan, together with whatdissenting secured or unsecured financial creditors are to be paid- Operational creditors are separately viewed from these securedand unsecured financial creditors in S.No.5 of paragraph 7 ofstatutory Form H - Thus, it can be seen that the Code and theRegulations, read as a whole, lead to the conclusion that theequality principle cannot be stretched to treating unequals equally,as that will destroy the very objective of the Code to resolve stressedassets - Equitable treatment is to be accorded to each creditordepending upon the class to which it belongs: secured orunsecured, financial or operational Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 – s. 21(8), 28 -Constitution of a sub-committee by the Committee of Creditors –Permissibility of – Plea that the Committee of Creditors delegatedits functions to a sub-committee, as a result of which, the subcommitteesecretly made negotiations with ArcelorMittal – Held:Section 28(1)(h) provides that though the powers of Committee ofCreditors are administrative in nature, they shall not be delegatedto any other person – Power of approval of resolution plan u/s.30(4), also cannot be delegated to any other body - However, subcommitteescan be appointed for the purpose of negotiating withresolution applicants, or for performing other ministerial oradministrative acts, provided such acts are in the ultimate analysisapproved and ratified by the Committee of Creditors – On facts,every single administrat ive decision qua approving andadministering the resolution plan submitted by ArcelorMittal wasin fact done by the requisite majority of the Committee of Creditorsitself, the sub-committee having been used only for purposes ofinitiating proceedings and negotiating with ArcelorMittal, whichultimately culminated in the resolution plan as finally negotiated,being passed by the requisite majority of creditors - StandardChartered Bank voted in favour of the constitution of a subcommitteeand also requested for inclusion of its name in sub-Committee, however, when the Standard Chartered Bank found thatthings were going against it that it started raising objections onthe technical plea that sub-committees cannot be constituted underthe Code, thus, plea was not bonafide and is rejected.Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 – s. 31(1) -Extinguishment of Personal Guarantees and Undecided Claims –Held: s. 31(1) makes it clear that once a resolution plan isapproved by the Committee of Creditors it shall be binding on allstakeholders, including guarantors – It cannot be said that partof the resolution plan which states that the claims of the guarantoron account of subrogation shall be extinguished, cannot be appliedto the guarantees furnished by the erstwhile directors of thecorporate debtor – A successful resolution applicant cannotsuddenly be faced with “undecided” claims after the resolution plansubmitted by him has been accepted as this would lead touncertainty regarding amounts payable by a prospective resolutionapplicant who successfully took over the business of the corporate debtor -

Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 – National CompanyLaw Tribunal- Adjudicating Authority and National Company LawAppellate Tribunal-Appellate Tribunal under – Jurisdiction of, quaresolution approved by Committee of Creditors – Held: AdjudicatingAuthority’s jurisdiction is circumscribed by s. 30(2) and AppellateTribunal’s jurisdiction is circumscribed by s. 32 rw s. 61(3) -Adjudicating Authority cannot interfere on merits with thecommercial decision taken by the Committee of Creditors, thelimited judicial review available is to see that the Committee ofCreditors has taken into account the fact that the corporate debtorneeds to keep going as a going concern during the insolvencyresolution process; that it needs to maximise the value of its assets;and that the interests of all stakeholders including operationalcreditors has been taken care of - If the Adjudicating Authorityfinds, on a given set of facts, that the said parameters have notbeen kept in view, it may send a resolution plan back to theCommittee of Creditors to re-submit such plan after satisfying thesaid parameters - Reasons given by the Committee of Creditorswhile approving a resolution plan may be looked at by theAdjudicating Authority only from this point of view, and once it issatisfied that Committee of Creditors has paid attention to thesekey features, it must then pass the resolution plan, other thingsbeing equal.Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 – Secured andunsecured creditors – Equality principle – Held: Secured andunsecured financial creditors are differentiated when it comes toamounts to be paid under a resolution plan, together with whatdissenting secured or unsecured financial creditors are to be paid- Operational creditors are separately viewed from these securedand unsecured financial creditors in S.No.5 of paragraph 7 ofstatutory Form H - Thus, it can be seen that the Code and theRegulations, read as a whole, lead to the conclusion that theequality principle cannot be stretched to treating unequals equally,as that will destroy the very objective of the Code to resolve stressedassets - Equitable treatment is to be accorded to each creditordepending upon the class to which it belongs: secured orunsecured, financial or operational Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 – s. 21(8), 28 -Constitution of a sub-committee by the Committee of Creditors –Permissibility of – Plea that the Committee of Creditors delegatedits functions to a sub-committee, as a result of which, the subcommitteesecretly made negotiations with ArcelorMittal – Held:Section 28(1)(h) provides that though the powers of Committee ofCreditors are administrative in nature, they shall not be delegatedto any other person – Power of approval of resolution plan u/s.30(4), also cannot be delegated to any other body - However, subcommitteescan be appointed for the purpose of negotiating withresolution applicants, or for performing other ministerial oradministrative acts, provided such acts are in the ultimate analysisapproved and ratified by the Committee of Creditors – On facts,every single administrat ive decision qua approving andadministering the resolution plan submitted by ArcelorMittal wasin fact done by the requisite majority of the Committee of Creditorsitself, the sub-committee having been used only for purposes ofinitiating proceedings and negotiating with ArcelorMittal, whichultimately culminated in the resolution plan as finally negotiated,being passed by the requisite majority of creditors - StandardChartered Bank voted in favour of the constitution of a subcommitteeand also requested for inclusion of its name in sub-Committee, however, when the Standard Chartered Bank found thatthings were going against it that it started raising objections onthe technical plea that sub-committees cannot be constituted underthe Code, thus, plea was not bonafide and is rejected.Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 – s. 31(1) -Extinguishment of Personal Guarantees and Undecided Claims –Held: s. 31(1) makes it clear that once a resolution plan isapproved by the Committee of Creditors it shall be binding on allstakeholders, including guarantors – It cannot be said that partof the resolution plan which states that the claims of the guarantoron account of subrogation shall be extinguished, cannot be appliedto the guarantees furnished by the erstwhile directors of thecorporate debtor – A successful resolution applicant cannotsuddenly be faced with “undecided” claims after the resolution plansubmitted by him has been accepted as this would lead touncertainty regarding amounts payable by a prospective resolutionapplicant who successfully took over the business of the corporate debtor - All claims must be submitted to and decided by theresolution professional so that a prospective resolution applicantknows exactly what has to be paid in order that it may then takeover and run the business of the corporate debtor - Successfulresolution applicant does on a fresh slate.Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (Amendment) Act, 2019 –ss. 4 and 6 – Constitutional Validity of – Held: As regards s. 4 ofthe Amendment Act, it is clear that as per s. 12 of the principalAct, the Corporate Insolvency Resolution proceedings should bemandatorily completed within a period of 330 days including anyextension and legal proceedings related to resolution process ofcorporate debtor – Further grace period of 90 days is given,failing which corporate debtor shall be sent into liquidation – Whileleaving the provision otherwise intact, the word “mandatorily” isstruck down as being manifestly arbitrary under Article 14 of theConstitution and as being an excessive and unreasonablerestriction on the litigant’s right to carry on business under Article19(1)(g) of the Constitution – As regards, the substitution of s.30(2)(b) by s. 6 of the Amending Act of 2019, it is constitutionallyvalid since the substituted s. 30(2)(b) is in fact a beneficialprovision in favour of operational creditors and dissentientfinancial creditors as they are now to be paid a certain minimumamount, the minimum in the case of operational creditors being thehigher of the two figures calculated under sub-clauses (i) and (ii)of clause (b), and the minimum in the case of dissentient financialcreditor being a minimum amount that was not earlier payable –Furthermore, Explanation 1 and 2 as also sub-clause (b) of s. 6of the Amending Act of 2019, is constitutionally valid.",

Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 – National CompanyLaw Tribunal- Adjudicating Authority and National Company LawAppellate Tribunal-Appellate Tribunal under – Jurisdiction of, quaresolution approved by Committee of Creditors – Held: AdjudicatingAuthority’s jurisdiction is circumscribed by s. 30(2) and AppellateTribunal’s jurisdiction is circumscribed by s. 32 rw s. 61(3) -Adjudicating Authority cannot interfere on merits with thecommercial decision taken by the Committee of Creditors, thelimited judicial review available is to see that the Committee ofCreditors has taken into account the fact that the corporate debtorneeds to keep going as a going concern during the insolvencyresolution process; that it needs to maximise the value of its assets;and that the interests of all stakeholders including operationalcreditors has been taken care of - If the Adjudicating Authorityfinds, on a given set of facts, that the said parameters have notbeen kept in view, it may send a resolution plan back to theCommittee of Creditors to re-submit such plan after satisfying thesaid parameters - Reasons given by the Committee of Creditorswhile approving a resolution plan may be looked at by theAdjudicating Authority only from this point of view, and once it issatisfied that Committee of Creditors has paid attention to thesekey features, it must then pass the resolution plan, other thingsbeing equal.Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 – Secured andunsecured creditors – Equality principle – Held: Secured andunsecured financial creditors are differentiated when it comes toamounts to be paid under a resolution plan, together with whatdissenting secured or unsecured financial creditors are to be paid- Operational creditors are separately viewed from these securedand unsecured financial creditors in S.No.5 of paragraph 7 ofstatutory Form H - Thus, it can be seen that the Code and theRegulations, read as a whole, lead to the conclusion that theequality principle cannot be stretched to treating unequals equally,as that will destroy the very objective of the Code to resolve stressedassets - Equitable treatment is to be accorded to each creditordepending upon the class to which it belongs: secured orunsecured, financial or operational Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 – s. 21(8), 28 -Constitution of a sub-committee by the Committee of Creditors –Permissibility of – Plea that the Committee of Creditors delegatedits functions to a sub-committee, as a result of which, the subcommitteesecretly made negotiations with ArcelorMittal – Held:Section 28(1)(h) provides that though the powers of Committee ofCreditors are administrative in nature, they shall not be delegatedto any other person – Power of approval of resolution plan u/s.30(4), also cannot be delegated to any other body - However, subcommitteescan be appointed for the purpose of negotiating withresolution applicants, or for performing other ministerial oradministrative acts, provided such acts are in the ultimate analysisapproved and ratified by the Committee of Creditors – On facts,every single administrat ive decision qua approving andadministering the resolution plan submitted by ArcelorMittal wasin fact done by the requisite majority of the Committee of Creditorsitself, the sub-committee having been used only for purposes ofinitiating proceedings and negotiating with ArcelorMittal, whichultimately culminated in the resolution plan as finally negotiated,being passed by the requisite majority of creditors - StandardChartered Bank voted in favour of the constitution of a subcommitteeand also requested for inclusion of its name in sub-Committee, however, when the Standard Chartered Bank found thatthings were going against it that it started raising objections onthe technical plea that sub-committees cannot be constituted underthe Code, thus, plea was not bonafide and is rejected.Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 – s. 31(1) -Extinguishment of Personal Guarantees and Undecided Claims –Held: s. 31(1) makes it clear that once a resolution plan isapproved by the Committee of Creditors it shall be binding on allstakeholders, including guarantors – It cannot be said that partof the resolution plan which states that the claims of the guarantoron account of subrogation shall be extinguished, cannot be appliedto the guarantees furnished by the erstwhile directors of thecorporate debtor – A successful resolution applicant cannotsuddenly be faced with “undecided” claims after the resolution plansubmitted by him has been accepted as this would lead touncertainty regarding amounts payable by a prospective resolutionapplicant who successfully took over the business of the corporate debtor - All claims must be submitted to and decided by theresolution professional so that a prospective resolution applicantknows exactly what has to be paid in order that it may then takeover and run the business of the corporate debtor - Successfulresolution applicant does on a fresh slate.Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (Amendment) Act, 2019 –ss. 4 and 6 – Constitutional Validity of – Held: As regards s. 4 ofthe Amendment Act, it is clear that as per s. 12 of the principalAct, the Corporate Insolvency Resolution proceedings should bemandatorily completed within a period of 330 days including anyextension and legal proceedings related to resolution process ofcorporate debtor – Further grace period of 90 days is given,failing which corporate debtor shall be sent into liquidation – Whileleaving the provision otherwise intact, the word “mandatorily” isstruck down as being manifestly arbitrary under Article 14 of theConstitution and as being an excessive and unreasonablerestriction on the litigant’s right to carry on business under Article19(1)(g) of the Constitution – As regards, the substitution of s.30(2)(b) by s. 6 of the Amending Act of 2019, it is constitutionallyvalid since the substituted s. 30(2)(b) is in fact a beneficialprovision in favour of operational creditors and dissentientfinancial creditors as they are now to be paid a certain minimumamount, the minimum in the case of operational creditors being thehigher of the two figures calculated under sub-clauses (i) and (ii)of clause (b), and the minimum in the case of dissentient financialcreditor being a minimum amount that was not earlier payable –Furthermore, Explanation 1 and 2 as also sub-clause (b) of s. 6of the Amending Act of 2019, is constitutionally valid.",

Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 – National CompanyLaw Tribunal- Adjudicating Authority and National Company LawAppellate Tribunal-Appellate Tribunal under – Jurisdiction of, quaresolution approved by Committee of Creditors – Held: AdjudicatingAuthority’s jurisdiction is circumscribed by s. 30(2) and AppellateTribunal’s jurisdiction is circumscribed by s. 32 rw s. 61(3) -Adjudicating Authority cannot interfere on merits with thecommercial decision taken by the Committee of Creditors, thelimited judicial review available is to see that the Committee ofCreditors has taken into account the fact that the corporate debtorneeds to keep going as a going concern during the insolvencyresolution process; that it needs to maximise the value of its assets;and that the interests of all stakeholders including operationalcreditors has been taken care of - If the Adjudicating Authorityfinds, on a given set of facts, that the said parameters have notbeen kept in view, it may send a resolution plan back to theCommittee of Creditors to re-submit such plan after satisfying thesaid parameters - Reasons given by the Committee of Creditorswhile approving a resolution plan may be looked at by theAdjudicating Authority only from this point of view, and once it issatisfied that Committee of Creditors has paid attention to thesekey features, it must then pass the resolution plan, other thingsbeing equal.Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 – Secured andunsecured creditors – Equality principle – Held: Secured andunsecured financial creditors are differentiated when it comes toamounts to be paid under a resolution plan, together with whatdissenting secured or unsecured financial creditors are to be paid- Operational creditors are separately viewed from these securedand unsecured financial creditors in S.No.5 of paragraph 7 ofstatutory Form H - Thus, it can be seen that the Code and theRegulations, read as a whole, lead to the conclusion that theequality principle cannot be stretched to treating unequals equally,as that will destroy the very objective of the Code to resolve stressedassets - Equitable treatment is to be accorded to each creditordepending upon the class to which it belongs: secured orunsecured, financial or operational Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 – s. 21(8), 28 -Constitution of a sub-committee by the Committee of Creditors –Permissibility of – Plea that the Committee of Creditors delegatedits functions to a sub-committee, as a result of which, the subcommitteesecretly made negotiations with ArcelorMittal – Held:Section 28(1)(h) provides that though the powers of Committee ofCreditors are administrative in nature, they shall not be delegatedto any other person – Power of approval of resolution plan u/s.30(4), also cannot be delegated to any other body - However, subcommitteescan be appointed for the purpose of negotiating withresolution applicants, or for performing other ministerial oradministrative acts, provided such acts are in the ultimate analysisapproved and ratified by the Committee of Creditors – On facts,every single administrat ive decision qua approving andadministering the resolution plan submitted by ArcelorMittal wasin fact done by the requisite majority of the Committee of Creditorsitself, the sub-committee having been used only for purposes ofinitiating proceedings and negotiating with ArcelorMittal, whichultimately culminated in the resolution plan as finally negotiated,being passed by the requisite majority of creditors - StandardChartered Bank voted in favour of the constitution of a subcommitteeand also requested for inclusion of its name in sub-Committee, however, when the Standard Chartered Bank found thatthings were going against it that it started raising objections onthe technical plea that sub-committees cannot be constituted underthe Code, thus, plea was not bonafide and is rejected.Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 – s. 31(1) -Extinguishment of Personal Guarantees and Undecided Claims –Held: s. 31(1) makes it clear that once a resolution plan isapproved by the Committee of Creditors it shall be binding on allstakeholders, including guarantors – It cannot be said that partof the resolution plan which states that the claims of the guarantoron account of subrogation shall be extinguished, cannot be appliedto the guarantees furnished by the erstwhile directors of thecorporate debtor – A successful resolution applicant cannotsuddenly be faced with “undecided” claims after the resolution plansubmitted by him has been accepted as this would lead touncertainty regarding amounts payable by a prospective resolutionapplicant who successfully took over the business of the corporate debtor - All claims must be submitted to and decided by theresolution professional so that a prospective resolution applicantknows exactly what has to be paid in order that it may then takeover and run the business of the corporate debtor - Successfulresolution applicant does on a fresh slate.Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (Amendment) Act, 2019 –ss. 4 and 6 – Constitutional Validity of – Held: As regards s. 4 ofthe Amendment Act, it is clear that as per s. 12 of the principalAct, the Corporate Insolvency Resolution proceedings should bemandatorily completed within a period of 330 days including anyextension and legal proceedings related to resolution process ofcorporate debtor – Further grace period of 90 days is given,failing which corporate debtor shall be sent into liquidation – Whileleaving the provision otherwise intact, the word “mandatorily” isstruck down as being manifestly arbitrary under Article 14 of theConstitution and as being an excessive and unreasonablerestriction on the litigant’s right to carry on business under Article19(1)(g) of the Constitution – As regards, the substitution of s.30(2)(b) by s. 6 of the Amending Act of 2019, it is constitutionallyvalid since the substituted s. 30(2)(b) is in fact a beneficialprovision in favour of operational creditors and dissentientfinancial creditors as they are now to be paid a certain minimumamount, the minimum in the case of operational creditors being thehigher of the two figures calculated under sub-clauses (i) and (ii)of clause (b), and the minimum in the case of dissentient financialcreditor being a minimum amount that was not earlier payable –Furthermore, Explanation 1 and 2 as also sub-clause (b) of s. 6of the Amending Act of 2019, is constitutionally valid.",

Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 – National CompanyLaw Tribunal- Adjudicating Authority and National Company LawAppellate Tribunal-Appellate Tribunal under – Jurisdiction of, quaresolution approved by Committee of Creditors – Held: AdjudicatingAuthority’s jurisdiction is circumscribed by s. 30(2) and AppellateTribunal’s jurisdiction is circumscribed by s. 32 rw s. 61(3) -Adjudicating Authority cannot interfere on merits with thecommercial decision taken by the Committee of Creditors, thelimited judicial review available is to see that the Committee ofCreditors has taken into account the fact that the corporate debtorneeds to keep going as a going concern during the insolvencyresolution process; that it needs to maximise the value of its assets;and that the interests of all stakeholders including operationalcreditors has been taken care of - If the Adjudicating Authorityfinds, on a given set of facts, that the said parameters have notbeen kept in view, it may send a resolution plan back to theCommittee of Creditors to re-submit such plan after satisfying thesaid parameters - Reasons given by the Committee of Creditorswhile approving a resolution plan may be looked at by theAdjudicating Authority only from this point of view, and once it issatisfied that Committee of Creditors has paid attention to thesekey features, it must then pass the resolution plan, other thingsbeing equal.Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 – Secured andunsecured creditors – Equality principle – Held: Secured andunsecured financial creditors are differentiated when it comes toamounts to be paid under a resolution plan, together with whatdissenting secured or unsecured financial creditors are to be paid- Operational creditors are separately viewed from these securedand unsecured financial creditors in S.No.5 of paragraph 7 ofstatutory Form H - Thus, it can be seen that the Code and theRegulations, read as a whole, lead to the conclusion that theequality principle cannot be stretched to treating unequals equally,as that will destroy the very objective of the Code to resolve stressedassets - Equitable treatment is to be accorded to each creditordepending upon the class to which it belongs: secured orunsecured, financial or operational Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 – s. 21(8), 28 -Constitution of a sub-committee by the Committee of Creditors –Permissibility of – Plea that the Committee of Creditors delegatedits functions to a sub-committee, as a result of which, the subcommitteesecretly made negotiations with ArcelorMittal – Held:Section 28(1)(h) provides that though the powers of Committee ofCreditors are administrative in nature, they shall not be delegatedto any other person – Power of approval of resolution plan u/s.30(4), also cannot be delegated to any other body - However, subcommitteescan be appointed for the purpose of negotiating withresolution applicants, or for performing other ministerial oradministrative acts, provided such acts are in the ultimate analysisapproved and ratified by the Committee of Creditors – On facts,every single administrat ive decision qua approving andadministering the resolution plan submitted by ArcelorMittal wasin fact done by the requisite majority of the Committee of Creditorsitself, the sub-committee having been used only for purposes ofinitiating proceedings and negotiating with ArcelorMittal, whichultimately culminated in the resolution plan as finally negotiated,being passed by the requisite majority of creditors - StandardChartered Bank voted in favour of the constitution of a subcommitteeand also requested for inclusion of its name in sub-Committee, however, when the Standard Chartered Bank found thatthings were going against it that it started raising objections onthe technical plea that sub-committees cannot be constituted underthe Code, thus, plea was not bonafide and is rejected.Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 – s. 31(1) -Extinguishment of Personal Guarantees and Undecided Claims –Held: s. 31(1) makes it clear that once a resolution plan isapproved by the Committee of Creditors it shall be binding on allstakeholders, including guarantors – It cannot be said that partof the resolution plan which states that the claims of the guarantoron account of subrogation shall be extinguished, cannot be appliedto the guarantees furnished by the erstwhile directors of thecorporate debtor – A successful resolution applicant cannotsuddenly be faced with “undecided” claims after the resolution plansubmitted by him has been accepted as this would lead touncertainty regarding amounts payable by a prospective resolutionapplicant who successfully took over the business of the corporate debtor - All claims must be submitted to and decided by theresolution professional so that a prospective resolution applicantknows exactly what has to be paid in order that it may then takeover and run the business of the corporate debtor - Successfulresolution applicant does on a fresh slate.Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (Amendment) Act, 2019 –ss. 4 and 6 – Constitutional Validity of – Held: As regards s. 4 ofthe Amendment Act, it is clear that as per s. 12 of the principalAct, the Corporate Insolvency Resolution proceedings should bemandatorily completed within a period of 330 days including anyextension and legal proceedings related to resolution process ofcorporate debtor – Further grace period of 90 days is given,failing which corporate debtor shall be sent into liquidation – Whileleaving the provision otherwise intact, the word “mandatorily” isstruck down as being manifestly arbitrary under Article 14 of theConstitution and as being an excessive and unreasonablerestriction on the litigant’s right to carry on business under Article19(1)(g) of the Constitution – As regards, the substitution of s.30(2)(b) by s. 6 of the Amending Act of 2019, it is constitutionallyvalid since the substituted s. 30(2)(b) is in fact a beneficialprovision in favour of operational creditors and dissentientfinancial creditors as they are now to be paid a certain minimumamount, the minimum in the case of operational creditors being thehigher of the two figures calculated under sub-clauses (i) and (ii)of clause (b), and the minimum in the case of dissentient financialcreditor being a minimum amount that was not earlier payable –Furthermore, Explanation 1 and 2 as also sub-clause (b) of s. 6of the Amending Act of 2019, is constitutionally valid.",

Equitable treatment is to be accorded to each creditordepending upon the class to which it belongs: secured orunsecured, financial or operational Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 – s. 21(8), 28 -Constitution of a sub-committee by the Committee of Creditors –Permissibility of – Plea that the Committee of Creditors delegatedits functions to a sub-committee, as a result of which, the subcommitteesecretly made negotiations with ArcelorMittal – Held:Section 28(1)(h) provides that though the powers of Committee ofCreditors are administrative in nature, they shall not be delegatedto any other person – Power of approval of resolution plan u/s.30(4), also cannot be delegated to any other body - However, subcommitteescan be appointed for the purpose of negotiating withresolution applicants, or for performing other ministerial oradministrative acts, provided such acts are in the ultimate analysisapproved and ratified by the Committee of Creditors – On facts,every single administrat ive decision qua approving andadministering the resolution plan submitted by ArcelorMittal wasin fact done by the requisite majority of the Committee of Creditorsitself, the sub-committee having been used only for purposes ofinitiating proceedings and negotiating with ArcelorMittal, whichultimately culminated in the resolution plan as finally negotiated,being passed by the requisite majority of creditors - StandardChartered Bank voted in favour of the constitution of a subcommitteeand also requested for inclusion of its name in sub-Committee, however, when the Standard Chartered Bank found thatthings were going against it that it started raising objections onthe technical plea that sub-committees cannot be constituted underthe Code, thus, plea was not bonafide and is rejected.Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 – s. 31(1) -Extinguishment of Personal Guarantees and Undecided Claims –Held: s. 31(1) makes it clear that once a resolution plan isapproved by the Committee of Creditors it shall be binding on allstakeholders, including guarantors – It cannot be said that partof the resolution plan which states that the claims of the guarantoron account of subrogation shall be extinguished, cannot be appliedto the guarantees furnished by the erstwhile directors of thecorporate debtor – A successful resolution applicant cannotsuddenly be faced with “undecided” claims after the resolution plansubmitted by him has been accepted as this would lead touncertainty regarding amounts payable by a prospective resolutionapplicant who successfully took over the business of the corporate debtor - All claims must be submitted to and decided by theresolution professional so that a prospective resolution applicantknows exactly what has to be paid in order that it may then takeover and run the business of the corporate debtor - Successfulresolution applicant does on a fresh slate.Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (Amendment) Act, 2019 –ss. 4 and 6 – Constitutional Validity of – Held: As regards s. 4 ofthe Amendment Act, it is clear that as per s. 12 of the principalAct, the Corporate Insolvency Resolution proceedings should bemandatorily completed within a period of 330 days including anyextension and legal proceedings related to resolution process ofcorporate debtor – Further grace period of 90 days is given,failing which corporate debtor shall be sent into liquidation – Whileleaving the provision otherwise intact, the word “mandatorily” isstruck down as being manifestly arbitrary under Article 14 of theConstitution and as being an excessive and unreasonablerestriction on the litigant’s right to carry on business under Article19(1)(g) of the Constitution – As regards, the substitution of s.30(2)(b) by s. 6 of the Amending Act of 2019, it is constitutionallyvalid since the substituted s. 30(2)(b) is in fact a beneficialprovision in favour of operational creditors and dissentientfinancial creditors as they are now to be paid a certain minimumamount, the minimum in the case of operational creditors being thehigher of the two figures calculated under sub-clauses (i) and (ii)of clause (b), and the minimum in the case of dissentient financialcreditor being a minimum amount that was not earlier payable –Furthermore, Explanation 1 and 2 as also sub-clause (b) of s. 6of the Amending Act of 2019, is constitutionally valid.",

(for himself, Ranjan Gogoi, CJI, and N.V. Ramana, Dr. D.Y.Chandrachud and Deepak Gupta, JJ.)] : Ordinarily therelationship between the Chief Justice and Judges would not bethat of fiduciary and a beneficiary – However, it is not an absoluterule/code for in certain situation and acts, fiduciary relationshipmay arise – Whether or not such a relationship arises in a particularsituation would have to be dealt with on the tests and parameters.

Chandrachud, J.]: The Chief Justice of India merelyholds the information in accordance with the official functions andnot in any fiduciary capacity – The judges who disclose their assetscannot be said to be vulnerable to and dependent on the ChiefJustice of India – In these circumstances, it cannot be held thatasset information shared with the Chief Justice of India, by theJudges of the Supreme Court, are held by him in a fiduciarycapacity, which, if revealed, would result in breach of fiduciaryduty.Right to Information Act, 2005 – s.8(1)(j) and s.11 – Held:[Per Dr. D.Y.

(for himself, Ranjan Gogoi, CJI,and N.V. Ramana, Dr. D.Y. Chandrachud and Deepak Gupta, JJ.)]:The independence of the judiciary is a matter of ennobled publicconcern and directly relates to public welfare and would be oneof the factors to be taken into account in weighing and applyingthe public interest test – Thus, when the public interest demands the disclosure of information, judicial independence has to be keptin mind while deciding the question of exercise of discretion –Reference to the principle of judicial independence is not toundermine and avoid accountability which is an aspect to be takeninto account while examining the public interest in favour ofdisclosure of information.Right to Information Act, 2005 – Transparency, judicialindependence and RTI Act – Held [Per N.V. Ramana, J.]: Thereneeds to be balance between the three equally important concepts– As a shield, the judicial independence is the basis with whichJudiciary has maintained its trust reposed by the citizens – Thejudiciary needs to be protected from attempts to breach itsindependence – Such interference requires calibration ofappropriate amount of transparency in consonance with judicialindependence – The right to information should not be allowed tobe used as a tool of surveillance to scuttle effective functioningof judiciary.Right to Information Act, 2005 – s.8 – non-exhaustiveconsiderations while assessing the ‘public interest’– Held [Per N.V.Ramana, J.]: The following non- exhaustive considerations needsto be considered while assessing the ‘public interest’ under Section8 of the RTI Act- a) Nature and content of the information; b)Consequences of non-disclosure; dangers and benefits to public;c) Type of confidential obligation; d) Beliefs of the confidant;reasonable suspicion; e) Party to whom information is disclosed;f) Manner in which information acquired; g)Public and privateinterests; h) Freedom of expression and proportionality",

(for himself, Ranjan Gogoi, CJI, and N.V. Ramana, Dr. D.Y.Chandrachud and Deepak Gupta, JJ.)] : Ordinarily therelationship between the Chief Justice and Judges would not bethat of fiduciary and a beneficiary – However, it is not an absoluterule/code for in certain situation and acts, fiduciary relationshipmay arise – Whether or not such a relationship arises in a particularsituation would have to be dealt with on the tests and parameters.

Chandrachud, J.]: The Chief Justice of India merelyholds the information in accordance with the official functions andnot in any fiduciary capacity – The judges who disclose their assetscannot be said to be vulnerable to and dependent on the ChiefJustice of India – In these circumstances, it cannot be held thatasset information shared with the Chief Justice of India, by theJudges of the Supreme Court, are held by him in a fiduciarycapacity, which, if revealed, would result in breach of fiduciaryduty.Right to Information Act, 2005 – s.8(1)(j) and s.11 – Held:[Per Dr. D.Y.

(for himself, Ranjan Gogoi, CJI,and N.V. Ramana, Dr. D.Y. Chandrachud and Deepak Gupta, JJ.)]:The independence of the judiciary is a matter of ennobled publicconcern and directly relates to public welfare and would be oneof the factors to be taken into account in weighing and applyingthe public interest test – Thus, when the public interest demands the disclosure of information, judicial independence has to be keptin mind while deciding the question of exercise of discretion –Reference to the principle of judicial independence is not toundermine and avoid accountability which is an aspect to be takeninto account while examining the public interest in favour ofdisclosure of information.Right to Information Act, 2005 – Transparency, judicialindependence and RTI Act – Held [Per N.V. Ramana, J.]: Thereneeds to be balance between the three equally important concepts– As a shield, the judicial independence is the basis with whichJudiciary has maintained its trust reposed by the citizens – Thejudiciary needs to be protected from attempts to breach itsindependence – Such interference requires calibration ofappropriate amount of transparency in consonance with judicialindependence – The right to information should not be allowed tobe used as a tool of surveillance to scuttle effective functioningof judiciary.Right to Information Act, 2005 – s.8 – non-exhaustiveconsiderations while assessing the ‘public interest’– Held [Per N.V.Ramana, J.]: The following non- exhaustive considerations needsto be considered while assessing the ‘public interest’ under Section8 of the RTI Act- a) Nature and content of the information; b)Consequences of non-disclosure; dangers and benefits to public;c) Type of confidential obligation; d) Beliefs of the confidant;reasonable suspicion; e) Party to whom information is disclosed;f) Manner in which information acquired; g)Public and privateinterests; h) Freedom of expression and proportionality",

(for himself, Ranjan Gogoi, CJI, and N.V. Ramana, Dr. D.Y.Chandrachud and Deepak Gupta, JJ.)] : Ordinarily therelationship between the Chief Justice and Judges would not bethat of fiduciary and a beneficiary – However, it is not an absoluterule/code for in certain situation and acts, fiduciary relationshipmay arise – Whether or not such a relationship arises in a particularsituation would have to be dealt with on the tests and parameters.

Chandrachud, J.]: The Chief Justice of India merelyholds the information in accordance with the official functions andnot in any fiduciary capacity – The judges who disclose their assetscannot be said to be vulnerable to and dependent on the ChiefJustice of India – In these circumstances, it cannot be held thatasset information shared with the Chief Justice of India, by theJudges of the Supreme Court, are held by him in a fiduciarycapacity, which, if revealed, would result in breach of fiduciaryduty.Right to Information Act, 2005 – s.8(1)(j) and s.11 – Held:[Per Dr. D.Y.

(for himself, Ranjan Gogoi, CJI,and N.V. Ramana, Dr. D.Y. Chandrachud and Deepak Gupta, JJ.)]:The independence of the judiciary is a matter of ennobled publicconcern and directly relates to public welfare and would be oneof the factors to be taken into account in weighing and applyingthe public interest test – Thus, when the public interest demands the disclosure of information, judicial independence has to be keptin mind while deciding the question of exercise of discretion –Reference to the principle of judicial independence is not toundermine and avoid accountability which is an aspect to be takeninto account while examining the public interest in favour ofdisclosure of information.Right to Information Act, 2005 – Transparency, judicialindependence and RTI Act – Held [Per N.V. Ramana, J.]: Thereneeds to be balance between the three equally important concepts– As a shield, the judicial independence is the basis with whichJudiciary has maintained its trust reposed by the citizens – Thejudiciary needs to be protected from attempts to breach itsindependence – Such interference requires calibration ofappropriate amount of transparency in consonance with judicialindependence – The right to information should not be allowed tobe used as a tool of surveillance to scuttle effective functioningof judiciary.Right to Information Act, 2005 – s.8 – non-exhaustiveconsiderations while assessing the ‘public interest’– Held [Per N.V.Ramana, J.]: The following non- exhaustive considerations needsto be considered while assessing the ‘public interest’ under Section8 of the RTI Act- a) Nature and content of the information; b)Consequences of non-disclosure; dangers and benefits to public;c) Type of confidential obligation; d) Beliefs of the confidant;reasonable suspicion; e) Party to whom information is disclosed;f) Manner in which information acquired; g)Public and privateinterests; h) Freedom of expression and proportionality",

P. (C) No. 992/19 and W. P. (C) No. 1003/19 as they did not tender theirresignation – Further, if it is held that the disqualificationproceedings would become infructuous upon tendering resignation,any member who is on the verge of being disqualified wouldimmediately resign and would escape from the sanctions providedu/Arts. 75(1B), 164(1B) & 361B – Such an interpretation wouldtherefore not only be against the intent behind the introduction ofthe Tenth Schedule, but also defeat the spirit of the 91stConstitutional Amendment – In addition, the decision of theSpeaker that a member is disqualified, relates back to the date ofthe disqualifying action complained of – Constitution (Fifty-secondAmendment) Act, 1985 – Tenth Schedule.

A “constitutional mandate”can be understood as what is required under, or by, theConstitution – In the context of the Tenth Schedule, and an orderof disqualification passed by the Speaker thereunder, the“constitutional mandate” is therefore nothing but what isconstitutionally required of the Speaker – A “violation ofconstitutional mandate” is merely an unconstitutional act of theSpeaker, one that cannot be defended on the touch-stone of theTenth Schedule and the powers or duties of the Speaker thereinand is in contravention or violation of the same – Constitution(Fifty-second Amendment) Act, 1985 – Tenth Schedule.",

A “constitutional mandate”can be understood as what is required under, or by, theConstitution – In the context of the Tenth Schedule, and an orderof disqualification passed by the Speaker thereunder, the“constitutional mandate” is therefore nothing but what isconstitutionally required of the Speaker – A “violation ofconstitutional mandate” is merely an unconstitutional act of theSpeaker, one that cannot be defended on the touch-stone of theTenth Schedule and the powers or duties of the Speaker thereinand is in contravention or violation of the same – Constitution(Fifty-second Amendment) Act, 1985 – Tenth Schedule.",
