Itis true, that mere selection does not give any vested right to theselected candidate to be appointed – However, at the same timewhen a large number of posts are lying vacant and selection processhas been followed, then the employer must satisfy the court as towhy it did not resort to and appoint the selected candidates, even ifthey are from the replacement panel – When the employer is theState it is bound to act according to Art.14 – There is no indicationin the pleadings that the vacancies were not to be filled up –Respondent No.1 failed to give any cogent reason to justify its actionof not calling for candidates from the replacement list of extra 20%candidates – Respondent No.1 to offer appointment to the eligibleappellants – Directions issued – [Per Hemant Gupta, J. (Dissenting)]State has a right not to appoint candidates even if they are in meritlist – Appellants do not possess indefeasible right of appointment –It is not the case, that any candidate lower in merit has beenappointed or the appointments have been made by pick and choosemethod ignoring merit – Stand of Railways that the requirement tofill up 624 vacant posts was not felt cannot be said to be arbitrary– No reason to interfere in the decision-making process of theRailways – Constitution of India – Art.14.",
