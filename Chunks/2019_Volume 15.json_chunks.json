Rules, 2012.Constitution of India: Arts.141 and 142 – Guidelines/Directions – Filling up the vaccum – In the absence of legislation– Held: The purpose of any judicial legislation is to fill a vacuum– It does not preclude legislators from enacting law – There is amplepower conferred by Art.32, read with Art.142 of the Constitutionto make orders which have the effect of law by virtue of Art.141of the Constitution, by issuing directions to fill the vacuum till suchtime as the legislature steps in to cover the gaps, or the executivedischarges its role – Judicial legislation.Administrative Law: Subordinate legislation/delegatedlegislation – Notification dated 30.7.2011 issued by the SocialJustice, Special Assistance Department of the State of Maharashtra,in exercise of powers under s.6(1) of Act of 2000 – Challengedon the ground that the Notification was not in conformity withdirections contained in Kumari Madhuri Patil* case – Held: Areading of Notification makes it clear that the Caste ScrutinyCommittees were constituted to facilitate verification of CasteCertificates of the candidates willing to contest for elective postin any local authority – The composition of the Committee wasmade in pursuance of the specific statutory power in terms of s.6(1)of the Act of 2000 – As far as a delegated legislation or anotification issued under statutory powers is concerned, thechallenge can be laid only in terms of well settled principles i.e.either the rule or notification is contrary to the provisions of theAct, or contrary to any provision of the Constitution, or bringsabout a conflict which is required to be resolved by the Court –The challenge in this case is not based on any of these parameters,but is simply on the ground that the notification is not in exactconformity with the directions issued by this Court in KumariMadhuri Patil case – Such a challenge would not be sustainablein view of the settled principles of examining such subordinatelegislation/statutory notifications – Thus, once the legislature laysdown a legislative policy, and confers discretion upon theadministrative agency for the execution of such policy, it is up tothe agency to work out the details within the framework of thepolicy – Maharashtra Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes, DenotifiedTribes (Vimukta Jatis), Nomadic Tribes, Other BackwardClasses and Special Backward Category

Verification of) Caste Certificate Act, 2000:Notification dated 30.7.2011 issued by the Social Justice, SpecialAssistance Department of the State of Maharashtra, in exercise ofpowers under s.6(1) of Act of 2000 – In terms of the Notification,35 district level commit tees were consti tuted to verify castecertificates of candidates who wished to contest the elections tolocal authorities – High Court quashed the said Notification withdirection that for both, the matters of constitution of the Committeeand operation of the Vigilance Cell, the directions in KumariMadhuri Patil* case have to be given full effect to – The originalcertificates issued in pursuance of Government Resolution of30.07.2011 were directed to be recovered from the respectivepersons and destroyed forthwith – However, said judgment wasstayed and as a result these certificates, issued under the saidcircular, continued to hold the field and the process followed asper the Act of 2000, read with the Rules of 2003 – On 31.8.2012,Maharashtra Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes, De-notifiedTribes (Vimukta Jatis), Nomadic Tribes, Other Backward Classesand Special Backward Category (Regulation of Issuance andVerification of) Caste Certificate Rules, 2012 were notified – Onceagain, the discretion was left to the Scrutiny Committee to solicit areport of vigilance inquiry, not making it mandatory – The issuepertained to the interregnum period between Notification issuedon 30.07.2011 and Rules notified on 31.08.2012 – Challenge wasto the Caste Validity Certificates granted to the candidates on theground that the said certificates were obtained by fraud, with aprayer for direction to the Election Commission to reject the nomination papers of such candidates – Held: Requirement ofverification of certificates by the Vigilance Cell was provided tobe mandatory in terms of judgment in Kumari Madhuri Patil* –However, as implemented for the interregnum period in question,the input from Vigilance Cell was obtained only selectively – Underthe Rules of 2012, the requirement was not made mandatory, butwhenever the Scrutiny Committee felt it could solicit a report ofvigilance inquiry and not in all cases – The exercise of issuanceof certificates cannot be a casual one – The Scrutiny Committeeconstituted to issue the validity certificates must thus at the slightestdoubt take the assistance of the Vigilance Cell to ensure that nonentitledpersons do not get benefit at the cost of entitled persons– The certificates in question were alleged to have been obtainedwithout vigilance reports and within a very short period of time –The exercise carried out in the interregnum period between30.7.2011 and 31.8.2012 clearly showed that no proper exercisewas carried out or could have been carried out given the timeframe within which the caste certificates were issued – Thus, theexercise so undertaken cannot be upheld and has to be quashedwith the direction to carry out the said exercise afresh – It will befor the Caste Scrutiny Committee to carry out the aforesaid exercisewhile notifying the parties concerned through appropriate publicnotices – These directions were to ensure the objectives of the Actof 2000 i.e. issuance of certificates only to entitled persons,through a proper exercise, with proper assistance from the VigilanceCell – Constitution of India – Art. 142 – Maharashtra

It does not preclude legislators from enacting law – There is amplepower conferred by Art.32, read with Art.142 of the Constitutionto make orders which have the effect of law by virtue of Art.141of

Act of 2000 – Challengedon the ground that the Notification was not in conformity withdirections contained in Kumari Madhuri Patil* case – Held: Areading of Notification makes it clear that the Caste ScrutinyCommittees were constituted to facilitate verification of CasteCertificates of the candidates willing to contest for elective postin any local authority – The composition of the Committee wasmade in pursuance of the specific statutory power in terms of s.6(1)of the Act of 2000 – As far as a delegated legislation or anotification issued under statutory powers is concerned, thechallenge can be laid only in terms of well settled principles i.e.either the rule or notification is contrary to the provisions of theAct, or contrary to any provision of the Constitution, or bringsabout a conflict which is required to be resolved by the Court –The challenge in this case is not based on any of these parameters,but is simply on the ground that the notification is not in exactconformity with the directions issued by this Court in KumariMadhuri Patil case – Such a challenge would not be sustainablein view of the settled principles of examining such subordinatelegislation/statutory notifications – Thus, once the legislature laysdown a legislative policy, and confers discretion upon theadministrative agency for the execution of such policy, it is up tothe agency to work out the

wentmissing around 4.00 p.m. – During the search operations by policeand family members of the missing child, it surfaced that theappellant was seen distributing chocolates to children around thetime the child went missing – Police reached the house of appellantand nabbed the appellant red handed under the bed with the victimchild in naked condition – Trial court and High Court concurrentlyheld him guilty and awarded death sentence – Appeal againstconviction and sentence – Held: It stood conclusively establishedthat the victim child was brutally assaulted and subjected to vaginaland unnatural intercourse – She was inflicted multiple injuries onface, head, neck, external genitalia as well as inside the uterusand urethra – Medical opinion was that death was due to throttling– There was overwhelming eye-witness account, circumstantialevidence, medical evidence and DNA analysis on record whichconclusively proved that it was appellant and he alone, whocommitted the horrendous crime – Appellant had the specialknowledge as to in what circumstances the victim child sufferedmultiple injuries – Burden to prove that those injuries were notcaused by him was on the appellant alone in view of s.106 of theEvidence Act, which he miserably failed to discharge though theevidence on record proved beyond doubt that the victim child wasin unlawful custody of the appellant from about 4.00

two-year old baby girlwhom the appellant kidnapped and apparently kept on assaultingover 4-5 hours till she breathed her last – Appellant who had nocontrol over his carnal desires surpassed all natural, social andlegal limits just to satiate his sexual hunger – He ruthlessly finisheda life which was yet to bloom – He, instead of showing fatherlylove, affection and protection to the child against the evils of thesociety, rather made her the victim of lust – It’s a case where trustwas betrayed and social values were impaired – The unnatural sexwith a two-year old toddler exhibits a dirty and perverted mind,showcasing a horrifying tale of brutality – The appel lantmeticulously executed his nefarious design by locking one doorof his house from the outside and bolting the other one from theinside so as to deceive people into believing that nobody was inside– He was thus in his full senses while he indulged in this senselessact – He showed no remorse or repentance for the gory crime,rather he opted to remain silent in his 313 Cr.P.C. statement – Hisdeliberate, well-designed silence with a standard defence of ‘false’accusation revealed his lack of kindness or compassion and

1860– ss.302, 363, 376 and 377.Criminal Law: Evidence – Motive – Though the High Courtobserved that ‘satisfaction of lust’ and ‘removal of trace’ was theappellant’s motive but motive is not an explicit requirement underthe Indian Penal Code, though ‘motive’ may be helpful in provingthe case of the prosecution in a case of circumstantial evidence –The case in hand was not entirely based on circumstantial evidenceas there were reliable eye-witness depositions who had seen theappellant committing the crime, may be in part – Such anunshakable evidence with dense support of DNA test did not requirethe definite determination of the motive of the appellant behind thegruesome crime.Sentence/Sentencing: Death sentence – Doctrine ofproportionality – The object and purpose of determining quantumof sentence has to be ‘society centric’ without being influenced by a ‘judge’s’ own views, for society is the biggest stake holder inthe administration of criminal justice system – A civic society hasa ‘fundamental’ and ‘human’ right to live free from any kind ofpsycho fear, threat, danger or insecurity at the hands of anti-socialelements – The society legitimately expects the Courts to applydoctrine of proportionality and impose suitable and deterrentpunishment that commensurates with the gravity of offence.Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012: s.5– Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Amendment Act,2019 – Aggravated Penetrative Sexual Assault – Punishment – Theunamended Act defines “Aggravated Penetrative Sexual Assault”in s.5, which included, “whoever commits aggravated penetrativesexual assault on a child below the age of 12 years” – Originally,the punishment for an aggravated sexual assault was rigorousimprisonment for a term not less than 10-years but which mayextend for imprisonment for life with fine – The minimum sentencefor an aggravated penetrative sexual assault has been increasedfrom 10 years to 20 years and imprisonment for life has now beenexpressly stated to be imprisonment for natural life of the person– Significantly, ‘death sentence’ has also been introduced as apenalty for the offence of aggravated penetrative sexual assaulton a child below 12 years – The Legislature impliedly distanceditself from the propounders of “No-Death Sentence” in “NoCircumstances” theory and re-stated the will of the people that inthe cases of brutal rape of minor children below the age of 12years without murder of the victim, ‘death penalty’ can also beimposed – In the Statement of Objects and Reasons of amendment,Parliament has shown its concern of the fact that “in recent pastincidents of child sexual abuse cases administering the inhumanmindset of the accused, who have been barbaric in their approachto young victim, is rising in the country” – If the Parliament, armedwith adequate facts and figures, has decided to introduce capitalpunishment for the offence of sexual abuse of a child, the Courthitherto will bear in mind the latest Legislative Policy even thoughit has no applicability in a case where the offence was committedprior thereto – The judicial precedents rendered before the recentamendment came into force, therefore, ought to be viewed with apurposive approach so that the legislative and judicial approachesare well harmonised – Crime against children – Sentence/Sentencing.Administration of Criminal Justice: Punishment to the rapeaccused – Sentencing Policy needs to strike a balance betweenthe two sides and count upon the twin test of (i) deterrent effect,or (ii) complete reformation for integration of the offender in civilsociety – Where the Court is satisfied that there is no possibility ofreforming the offender, the punishments before all things, must bebefitting the nature of crime and deterrent with an explicit aim tomake an example out of the evil-doer and a warning to those whoare still innocent – Sentence/Sentencing.Evidence: Medical evidence – DNA – Plea of appellantaccusedthat the prosecution relied on the DNA evidence despitethe fact that the method of analysis used i.e. Y-Chromosome ShortTandem Repeat Polymorphism (Y-STR) has certain inherentlimitations due to which accurate identification of accused cannotbe established beyond reasonable doubt and that the said methoddid not accurately identify the accused as the perpetrator; andunlike other methods say autosomal-STR analysis, it cannotdistinguish between male members in the same lineage – Held: Pleais rejected – The globally acknowledged medical literature coupledwith the statement of the Assistant Director, Forensic ScienceLaboratory leaves no doubt that in cases of sexual assualt, DNAof the victim and the perpetrator are often mixed – Traditional DNAanalysis techniques like “autosomal-STR” are not possible in suchcases – Y-STR method provides a unique way of isolating only themale DNA by comparing the Y-Chromosome which is found onlyin males – It is no longer a matter of scientific debate that Y-STRscreening is manifestly useful for corroboration in sexual assaultcases and it can be well used as exculpatory evidence and isextensively relied upon in various jurisdictions throughout the world– Science and Researches have emphatically established thatchances of degradation of the ‘Loci’ in samples are lesser by thismethod and it can be more effective than other traditional methodsof DNA analysis – Although Y-STR does not distinguish betweenthe males of same lineage, it can, nevertheless, may be used as astrong circumstantial evidence to support the prosecution case –Y-STR techniques of DNA analysis are both regularly used invarious jurisdictions for identification of offender in cases ofsexual assault and also as a method to identify suspects in unsolvedcases – Medical jurisprudence.Sentence/Sentencing: Death sentence – Commutation of –Aggravating and mitigating circumstances – Rape and murder oftwo year old girl child – Held: (Per R. Subhash Reddy, J. -dissenting on sentencing part) – In a case of conviction based oncircumstantial evidence, ordinarily the extreme punishment of deathpenalty should not be imposed – If in a given case, guilt of theaccused is proved beyond reasonable doubt, by establishing chainof circumstances, resulting in conviction, in appropriate casesdeath penalty can be imposed only after considering balancingaspects of aggravating and mitigating circumstances – But, at thesame time ordinarily, if no special reasons exist, in a case ofconviction based on circumstantial evidence, death penalty shouldnot be imposed – In the instant case, conviction of the appellantwas mainly based on circumstantial evidence – The evidence onrecordshowed that on the day of occurrence, the appellant wasunder influence of liquor and committed the offence and,therefore, it cannot be termed as a pre-planned one, to count thesame as an aggravating circumstance, for balancing aggravatingand mitigating circumstances – The socio-economic condition ofthe appellant, as a person below poverty line, can also beconsidered as one of the mitigating factors, while balancing theaggravating and mitigating factors – There was no evidence fromthe side of prosecution, to show that there was no possibility ofreformation and rehabilitation of the appellant – Age of theappellant was 25 years at the relevant time – He also had no crimerecord – Thus, the mitigating circumstances of the appellant,dominated over the aggravating circumstances, to modify the deathsentence to that of life imprisonment – In view of all these aspects,death penalty imposed on the appellant is modified to that of lifeimprisonment, for the offence under s.302 IPC – Penal Code, 1860– s.302.",

Subhash Reddy, J. -dissenting on sentencing part) – In a case of conviction based oncircumstantial evidence, ordinarily the extreme punishment of deathpenalty should not be imposed – If in a given case, guilt of theaccused is proved beyond reasonable doubt, by establishing chainof circumstances, resulting in conviction, in appropriate casesdeath penalty can be imposed only after considering balancingaspects of aggravating and mitigating circumstances – But, at thesame time ordinarily, if no special reasons exist, in a case ofconviction based on circumstantial evidence, death penalty shouldnot be imposed – In the instant case, conviction of the appellantwas mainly based on circumstantial evidence – The evidence onrecordshowed that on the day of occurrence, the appellant wasunder influence of liquor and committed the offence and,therefore, it cannot be termed as a pre-planned one, to count thesame as an aggravating circumstance, for balancing aggravatingand mitigating circumstances – The socio-economic condition ofthe appellant, as a person below poverty line, can also beconsidered as one of the mitigating factors, while balancing theaggravating and mitigating factors – There was no evidence fromthe side of prosecution, to show that there was no possibility ofreformation and rehabilitation of the appellant – Age of theappellant was 25 years at the relevant time – He also had no crimerecord – Thus, the mitigating circumstances of the appellant,dominated over the aggravating circumstances, to modify the deathsentence to that of life imprisonment – In view of all these aspects,death penalty imposed on the appellant is modified to that of lifeimprisonment, for the offence under s.302 IPC – Penal Code, 1860– s.302.",

        "HeadNote": "Penal Code, 1860: ss.302, 363, 376 and 377 – Kidnapping,rape/unnatural intercourse and murder of two year old girl –Prosecution case was that on the fateful day, the victim child wentmissing around 4.00 p.m. – During the search operations by policeand family members of the missing child, it surfaced that theappellant was seen distributing chocolates to children around thetime the child went missing – Police reached the house of appellantand nabbed the appellant red handed under the bed with the victimchild in naked condition – Trial court and High Court concurrentlyheld him guilty and awarded death sentence – Appeal againstconviction and sentence – Held: It stood conclusively establishedthat the victim child was brutally assaulted and subjected to vaginaland unnatural intercourse – She was inflicted multiple injuries onface, head, neck, external genitalia as well as inside the uterusand urethra – Medical opinion was that death was due to throttling– There was overwhelming eye-witness account, circumstantialevidence, medical evidence and DNA analysis on record whichconclusively proved that it was appellant and he alone, whocommitted the horrendous crime – Appellant had the specialknowledge as to in what circumstances the victim child sufferedmultiple injuries – Burden to prove that those injuries were notcaused by him was on the appellant alone in view of s.106 of theEvidence Act, which he miserably failed to discharge though theevidence on record proved beyond doubt that the victim child wasin unlawful custody of the appellant from about 4.00 p.m. till shebreathed her last breath due to the beastly attack on her –Conviction of appellant is upheld – Protection of Children fromSexual Offences Act, 2012 – Protection of Children from SexualOffences Amendment Act, 2019.Sentence/Sentencing: Death sentence – Rape and murder oftwo year old girl – Prayer for commutation of death sentence –Held: The victim in this case was barely a two-year old baby girlwhom the appellant kidnapped and apparently kept on assaultingover 4-5 hours till she breathed her last – Appellant who had nocontrol over his carnal desires surpassed all natural, social andlegal limits just to satiate his sexual hunger – He ruthlessly finisheda life which was yet to bloom – He, instead of showing fatherlylove, affection and protection to the child against the evils of thesociety, rather made her the victim of lust – It’s a case where trustwas betrayed and social values were impaired – The unnatural sexwith a two-year old toddler exhibits a dirty and perverted mind,showcasing a horrifying tale of brutality – The appel lantmeticulously executed his nefarious design by locking one doorof his house from the outside and bolting the other one from theinside so as to deceive people into believing that nobody was inside– He was thus in his full senses while he indulged in this senselessact – He showed no remorse or repentance for the gory crime,rather he opted to remain silent in his 313 Cr.P.C. statement – Hisdeliberate, well-designed silence with a standard defence of ‘false’accusation revealed his lack of kindness or compassion and wouldlead to believe that he can never be reformed – That being so, casefor interference with the death sentence is not made out – Protectionof Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012 – Penal Code, 1860– ss.302, 363, 376 and 377.Criminal Law: Evidence – Motive – Though the High Courtobserved that ‘satisfaction of lust’ and ‘removal of trace’ was theappellant’s motive but motive is not an explicit requirement underthe Indian Penal Code, though ‘motive’ may be helpful in provingthe case of the prosecution in a case of circumstantial evidence –The case in hand was not entirely based on circumstantial evidenceas there were reliable eye-witness depositions who had seen theappellant committing the crime, may be in part – Such anunshakable evidence with dense support of DNA test did not requirethe definite determination of the motive of the appellant behind thegruesome crime.Sentence/Sentencing: Death sentence – Doctrine ofproportionality – The object and purpose of determining quantumof sentence has to be ‘society centric’ without being influenced by a ‘judge’s’ own views, for society is the biggest stake holder inthe administration of criminal justice system – A civic society hasa ‘fundamental’ and ‘human’ right to live free from any kind ofpsycho fear, threat, danger or insecurity at the hands of anti-socialelements – The society legitimately expects the Courts to applydoctrine of proportionality and impose suitable and deterrentpunishment that commensurates with the gravity of offence.Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012: s.5– Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Amendment Act,2019 – Aggravated Penetrative Sexual Assault – Punishment – Theunamended Act defines “Aggravated Penetrative Sexual Assault”in s.5, which included, “whoever commits aggravated penetrativesexual assault on a child below the age of 12 years” – Originally,the punishment for an aggravated sexual assault was rigorousimprisonment for a term not less than 10-years but which mayextend for imprisonment for life with fine – The minimum sentencefor an aggravated penetrative sexual assault has been increasedfrom 10 years to 20 years and imprisonment for life has now beenexpressly stated to be imprisonment for natural life of the person– Significantly, ‘death sentence’ has also been introduced as apenalty for the offence of aggravated penetrative sexual assaulton a child below 12 years – The Legislature impliedly distanceditself from the propounders of “No-Death Sentence” in “NoCircumstances” theory and re-stated the will of the people that inthe cases of brutal rape of minor children below the age of 12years without murder of the victim, ‘death penalty’ can also beimposed – In the Statement of Objects and Reasons of amendment,Parliament has shown its concern of the fact that “in recent pastincidents of child sexual abuse cases administering the inhumanmindset of the accused, who have been barbaric in their approachto young victim, is rising in the country” – If the Parliament, armedwith adequate facts and figures, has decided to introduce capitalpunishment for the offence of sexual abuse of a child, the Courthitherto will bear in mind the latest Legislative Policy even thoughit has no applicability in a case where the offence was committedprior thereto – The judicial precedents rendered before the recentamendment came into force, therefore, ought to be viewed with apurposive approach so that the legislative and judicial approachesare well harmonised – Crime against children – Sentence/Sentencing.Administration of Criminal Justice: Punishment to the rapeaccused – Sentencing Policy needs to strike a balance betweenthe two sides and count upon the twin test of (i) deterrent effect,or (ii) complete reformation for integration of the offender in civilsociety – Where the Court is satisfied that there is no possibility ofreforming the offender, the punishments before all things, must bebefitting the nature of crime and deterrent with an explicit aim tomake an example out of the evil-doer and a warning to those whoare still innocent – Sentence/Sentencing.Evidence: Medical evidence – DNA – Plea of appellantaccusedthat the prosecution relied on the DNA evidence despitethe fact that the method of analysis used i.e. Y-Chromosome ShortTandem Repeat Polymorphism (Y-STR) has certain inherentlimitations due to which accurate identification of accused cannotbe established beyond reasonable doubt and that the said methoddid not accurately identify the accused as the perpetrator; andunlike other methods say autosomal-STR analysis, it cannotdistinguish between male members in the same lineage – Held: Pleais rejected – The globally acknowledged medical literature coupledwith the statement of the Assistant Director, Forensic ScienceLaboratory leaves no doubt that in cases of sexual assualt, DNAof the victim and the perpetrator are often mixed – Traditional DNAanalysis techniques like “autosomal-STR” are not possible in suchcases – Y-STR method provides a unique way of isolating only themale DNA by comparing the Y-Chromosome which is found onlyin males – It is no longer a matter of scientific debate that Y-STRscreening is manifestly useful for corroboration in sexual assaultcases and it can be well used as exculpatory evidence and isextensively relied upon in various jurisdictions throughout the world– Science and Researches have emphatically established thatchances of degradation of the ‘Loci’ in samples are lesser by thismethod and it can be more effective than other traditional methodsof DNA analysis – Although Y-STR does not distinguish betweenthe males of same lineage, it can, nevertheless, may be used as astrong circumstantial evidence to support the prosecution case –Y-STR techniques of DNA analysis are both regularly used invarious jurisdictions for identification of offender in cases ofsexual assault and also as a method to identify suspects in unsolvedcases – Medical jurisprudence.Sentence/Sentencing: Death sentence – Commutation of –Aggravating and mitigating circumstances – Rape and murder oftwo year old girl child – Held: (Per R. Subhash Reddy, J. -dissenting on sentencing part) – In a case of conviction based oncircumstantial evidence, ordinarily the extreme punishment of deathpenalty should not be imposed – If in a given case, guilt of theaccused is proved beyond reasonable doubt, by establishing chainof circumstances, resulting in conviction, in appropriate casesdeath penalty can be imposed only after considering balancingaspects of aggravating and mitigating circumstances – But, at thesame time ordinarily, if no special reasons exist, in a case ofconviction based on circumstantial evidence, death penalty shouldnot be imposed – In the instant case, conviction of the appellantwas mainly based on circumstantial evidence – The evidence onrecordshowed that on the day of occurrence, the appellant wasunder influence of liquor and committed the offence and,therefore, it cannot be termed as a pre-planned one, to count thesame as an aggravating circumstance, for balancing aggravatingand mitigating circumstances – The socio-economic condition ofthe appellant, as a person below poverty line, can also beconsidered as one of the mitigating factors, while balancing theaggravating and mitigating factors – There was no evidence fromthe side of prosecution, to show that there was no possibility ofreformation and rehabilitation of the appellant – Age of theappellant was 25 years at the relevant time – He also had no crimerecord – Thus, the mitigating circumstances of the appellant,dominated over the aggravating circumstances, to modify the deathsentence to that of life imprisonment – In view of all these aspects,death penalty imposed on the appellant is modified to that of lifeimprisonment, for the offence under s.302 IPC – Penal Code, 1860– s.302.",

Neogy’case did not go into and decide the issue, whetherimmovable property would fall under the expression ‘any property’u/s. 102 – Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 – s. 102.Ratio decidendi – Meaning of – Held: A decision is only anauthority for what it actually decides – The essence in a decision isits ratio – Not every observation found therein nor what logicallyflows from those observations is the ratio decidendi – Judgmenthas to be read as a whole and the observations have to be consideredin light of the instances which were before the court – This is theway to ascertain the true principles laid down by a decision – Ratiodecidendi cannot be decided by picking out words or sentences averse to the context under question from the judgment – Thus, it isclear that Tapas D.

No.4184 of2009, the assessee-respondent Club, registered u/s.25, 1956 Actwas issued notice informing that it had failed to make payment ofsales tax on sale of food and drinks to the permanent members –Respondent contended that there could be no sale by it to its ownpermanent members, for doctrine of mutuality would come into play– West Bengal Taxation Tribunal held that the respondent is noteligible to tax under the 1994 Act – Affirmed by the High Court –Division Bench of the Supreme Court set out inter alia 3 questions tobe answered by larger Bench, viz.(i) Whether the doctrine ofmutuality is still applicable to incorporated clubs or any club afterthe 46th Amendment to Art.366(29-A) of the Constitution of India?;(ii) Whether the judgment of Supreme Court in Young Men’s IndianAssociation case still holds the field even after the 46th Amendment?and (iii) Whether the 46th Amendment, by deeming fiction providesthat provision of food and beverages by the incorporated clubs toits permanent members constitute sale, thus liable to sales tax? – InC.A. No.7497 of 2012 and connected matters, issue involves levyingof service tax by Finance Act, 1994 upon members’ clubs, majorityof them being registered as Companies u/s.25 of the 1956 Act, or asco-operative societies under various State Acts – Held: Young Men’sIndian Assn. made no distinction between a club in the corporateform and a club by way of a registered society or incorporated by adeed of trust – What is the essence of the judgment is that the holdingof property must be a holding for and on behalf of the members ofthe club, there being no transfer of property from one person toanother – In members’ clubs there is a complete identity betweencontributors and participators – Thus, in members’ clubs there is no sale by one person to another for consideration, as one cannotsell something to oneself – What is of essence in applying thedoctrine of mutuality is that there is no sale transaction betweentwo persons, as one person cannot sell goods to itself – Ratio ofYoung Men’s Indian Assn. has not been done away with by the limitedfiction introduced by Art.366(29-A)(e) – Questions answered (i)Doctrine of mutuality continues to be applicable to incorporatedand unincorporated members’ clubs after the 46th Amendment addingArt.366(29-A); (ii) Young Men’s Indian Assn. and other judgmentswhich applied this doctrine continue to hold the field even after the46th Amendment; and (iii) Sub-clause (f) of Art.366(29-A) has noapplication to members’ clubs – No interference called for in thefindings of fact or declaration of law in this case – Further, in C.A.No.7497/12 and connected matters- Argument on behalf of therespondents that incorporated clubs or associations prior to 1st July,2012 were not included in the service tax net is accepted – Whathas been stated in the present judgment so far as sales tax isconcerned applies on all fours to service tax– Explanation 3(a) tos.65B(44) of the Finance Act, 1994 does not apply to members’clubs which are incorporated – From 2005 onwards, the FinanceAct, 1994 does not purport to levy service tax on members’ clubs inthe incorporated form – Jharkhand High Court and the GujaratHigh Court correct in their view of the law in following Young Men’sIndian Assn. Case – Thus, show-cause notices, demand notices andother action taken to levy and collect service tax from incorporatedmembers’ clubs are void and of no effect in law – West Bengal SalesTax Act, 1994 – ss.2(5), (10), (30) & s.9 Constitution of India –Art.366(29-A)(e)(f) – Companies Act, 1956 – s.25 – Constitution(Forty-sixth Amendment) Act, 1982 – General Clauses Act – IncomeTax Act, 1961 – s.2(24)(vii), 2(31), 44, 45(2) – Finance Act, 1994 –ss.64(3), 65(25a), (25aa), 65(105)(zze), 65(A), 65B(37), Explanation3(a) to s.65B(44), 66B, 66D, 67, 68 – Finance Act, 2006 – FinanceAct, 2012 – Interpretation of Statutes – Central Sales Tax Act, 1956.Constitution of India – 46th Amendment to Art.366(29-A) –61st Law Commission Report – Plea on behalf of the appellants,referring to the said Report, which preceded the enactment ofArt.366(29-A); the ‘Statement of Objects and Reasons’ appendedto the 1981 Bill, which led to the insertion of Art.366(29-A); and in particular to Art.366(29-A)(e), (f) to contend that Art.366(29-A)(e)was inserted in order to do away with the doctrine of mutuality,insofar as it applied to members’ clubs and, therefore, sought to doaway with the basis of the judgment in Young Men’s Indian Assn.case – Held: Statement of Objects and Reasons has not read thecase of Young Men’s Indian Assn. in its correct perspective – YoungMen’s Indian Assn. had three separate appeals before it, in one ofwhich a company was involved – To state, therefore, that under thelaw as it stood on the date of the 46th Amendment, a sale of goodsby a club having a corporate status to members is taxable, is whollyincorrect – Proceeding on this incorrect basis, the 46th Amendmentthen sought to bring to tax sales by clubs which have no separateexistence from that of their members – In so doing, the 46thAmendment used the expression “any unincorporated associationor body of persons” – This expression, when read with the Statementof Objects and Reasons, makes it clear that it was only clubs whichare not in corporate form that were sought to be brought within thetax net, as it was wrongly assumed that sale of goods by members’clubs in the corporate form were taxable –”Any” is the equivalentof “all”– This word, therefore, also lends itself to the aforesaidinterpretation, as the emphasis of the legislature is on allunincorporated associations or bodies being brought within subclause(e) – Constitution (Forty-sixth Amendment) Bill, 1981 –Constitution (Forty-sixth Amendment) Act, 1982 – Interpretation ofStatutes – Doctrine of Mutuality.Words & Expressions – “unincorporated association or bodyof persons” in sub-clause (e) to Art.366(29-A) – Plea on behalf ofthe appellants that the said expression must be read disjunctivelyand thus, would include incorporated persons such as companies,cooperative societies etc. – Held: On the assumption that“unincorporated association or body of persons” must be readdisjunctively, “a body of persons” cannot be equated with “person”– “Person” as defined by the General Clauses Act (which appliesto the interpretation of the Constitution vide Art.367) states that“person” shall include any company or association or body ofindividuals, whether incorporated or not – Art.366(29-A) does notuse this expression, as “person” would then include corporatepersons as well – “body of persons” is used to make it clear beyond doubt that corporate persons are not referred to – Further, contrastin the language of the 1961 Act and Art.366(29-A)(e) again leadsto the conclusion that “body of persons” would not refer to thecorporate form unless “person” by itself is accompanied by theexpression “whether incorporated or not” – Constitution of India– Art.366(29-A)(e), 367 – General Clauses Act – Income TaxAct, 1961 – s.2(31) – Interpretation of Statutes.Contract Act, 1872 – s.2(d) – Plea on behalf of the respondentthat s.2(d) makes it clear that consideration must flow from oneperson to another and in the absence of two players, as in the caseof Young Men’s Indian Assn., Art.366(29-A) would have no application– Held: “supply” of goods by an unincorporated association orbody of persons has to be to a member for cash, deferred paymentor other valuable consideration – Correctly argued by therespondents, the definition of “consideration” in s.2(d) of the 1872Act necessarily posits consideration passing from one person toanother – This is further reinforced by the last part of Art.366(29-A), as under this part, the supply of such goods shall be deemed tobe sale of those goods by the person making the supply, and thepurchase of those goods by the person to whom such supply is made– As the Young Men’s Indian Assn. case and the doctrine of mutualitystate, there is no sale transaction between a club and its members –Ratio of Young Men’s Indian Assn. has not been done away with bythe limited fiction introduced by Art.366(29-A)(e) – Constitution ofIndia – Art.366(29-A) – West Bengal Sales Tax Act, 1994 – ss.2(5),(30) – Doctrine of Mutuality.Constitution of India– Art.366(29-A)(e), (f)– Applicability ofsub-clause (f) to members’ club – Held: Reason for sub-clause (f),as stated in the Statement of Objects and Reasons, is the doingaway with of two judgments of Supreme Court, viz., Associated Hotelsof India Ltd. and Northern India Caterers – This is also clear from thesubject matter of sub-clause (f) (which does not include “goods” intheir entirety, but only food or any other article for humanconsumption, or any drink), which is the serving of such food ordrink in hotels or restaurants – This is further made clear by s.6 ofthe 46th Amendment Act, which is a validation and exemptionprovision – s.6(1)(a) specifically refers to transactions referable tothe aforesaid two Supreme Court judgments – Sub-clause (a) of s.6(2) refers to 07.09.1978, which is the date on which NorthernIndia Caterers was pronounced and sub-clause (b) refers to04.01.1972, when Associated Hotels of India Ltd. was pronounced –46th Amendment Act, therefore, when read as a whole, would makeit clear that Art.366(29-A)(f) refers only to an undoing of theaforesaid two judgments, the subject matter being the taxability offood or drink served in hotels and restaurants – Thus, the taxabilityof food or drink served in members’ clubs is not the subject matterof sub-clause (f) – Subject matter of sub-clause (f) is entirelydifferent and distinct from that of sub-clause (e), and cannot possiblyapply to members’ clubs – Thus, expression “in any mannerwhatsoever”, being part and parcel of sub-clause (f) cannot beheld to extend to a supply of all goods so as to bring such goods totax when applied to members’ clubs – Constitution (Forty-sixthAmendment) Act,1982 – s.6.Income Tax Act, 1961 – ss.2(24)(vii), 44, 45(2) – Held:Doctrine of Mutuality has not been done away with by sub-clause(e) to Art.366(29-A) is also clear when sub-clause (e) is contrastedwith s.2(24)(vii) of the 1961 Act r/w s.44 – A reading of the saidprovisions make it clear that when profits and gains of a mutualinsurance company are sought to be brought to tax, they are sodone by express reference to the fact that the business of insuranceis carried on by a mutual insurance company – Absence of anysuch language in sub-clause (e) of Art.366(29-A) is also an importantpointer to the fact that the doctrine of mutuality cannot be said tohave been done away with by the said 46th Amendment – Also, s.45(2)is an example of a provision by which a deemed transfer by a personto himself gets taxed – Modalities such

Case – Thus, show-cause notices, demand notices andother action taken to levy and collect service tax from incorporatedmembers’ clubs are void and of no effect in law – West Bengal SalesTax Act, 1994

Interpretation of Statutes – Central Sales Tax Act, 1956.Constitution of India – 46th Amendment to Art.366(29-A) –61st Law Commission Report – Plea on behalf of the appellants,referring to the said Report, which preceded the enactment ofArt.366(29-A); the ‘Statement of Objects and Reasons’ appendedto the 1981 Bill, which led to the insertion of Art.366(29-A); and in particular to Art.366(29-A)(e), (f) to contend that Art.366(29-A)(e)was inserted in order to do away with the doctrine of mutuality,insofar as it applied to members’ clubs and, therefore, sought to doaway with the basis of the judgment in Young Men’s Indian Assn.case – Held: Statement of Objects and Reasons has not read thecase of Young Men’s Indian Assn. in its correct perspective – YoungMen’s Indian Assn. had three separate appeals before it, in one ofwhich a company was involved – To state, therefore, that under thelaw as it stood on the date of the 46th Amendment, a sale of goodsby a club having a corporate status to members is taxable, is whollyincorrect – Proceeding on this incorrect basis, the 46th Amendmentthen sought to bring to tax sales by clubs which have no separateexistence from that of their members – In so doing, the 46thAmendment used the expression “any unincorporated associationor body of persons” – This expression, when read with the Statementof Objects and Reasons, makes it clear that it was only clubs whichare not in corporate form that were sought to be brought within thetax net, as it was wrongly assumed that sale of goods by members’clubs in the corporate form were taxable –”Any” is the equivalentof “all”– This word, therefore, also lends itself to the aforesaidinterpretation, as the emphasis of the legislature is on allunincorporated associations or bodies being brought within subclause(e) – Constitution (Forty-sixth Amendment) Bill, 1981 –Constitution (Forty-sixth Amendment) Act, 1982 – Interpretation ofStatutes – Doctrine of Mutuality.Words & Expressions – “unincorporated association or bodyof persons” in sub-clause (e) to Art.366(29-A) – Plea on behalf ofthe appellants that the said expression must be read disjunctivelyand thus, would include incorporated persons such as companies,cooperative societies etc. – Held: On the assumption that“unincorporated association or body of persons” must be readdisjunctively, “a body of persons” cannot be equated with “person”– “Person” as defined by the General Clauses Act (which appliesto the interpretation of the Constitution vide Art.367) states that“person” shall include any company or association or body ofindividuals, whether incorporated or not – Art.366(29-A) does notuse this expression, as “person” would then include corporatepersons as well – “body of persons” is used to make it clear beyond doubt that corporate persons are not referred to – Further, contrastin the language of the 1961 Act and Art.366(29-A)(e) again leadsto the conclusion that “body of persons” would not refer to thecorporate form unless “person” by itself is accompanied by theexpression “whether incorporated or not” – Constitution of India– Art.366(29-A)(e), 367 – General Clauses Act – Income TaxAct, 1961 – s.2(31) – Interpretation of Statutes.Contract Act, 1872 – s.2(d) – Plea on behalf of the respondentthat s.2(d) makes it clear that consideration must flow from oneperson to another and in the absence of two players, as in the caseof Young Men’s Indian Assn., Art.366(29-A) would have no application– Held: “supply” of goods by an unincorporated association orbody of persons has to be to a member for cash, deferred paymentor other valuable consideration – Correctly argued by therespondents, the definition of “consideration” in s.2(d) of the 1872Act necessarily posits consideration passing from one person toanother – This is further reinforced by the last part of Art.366(29-A), as under this part, the supply of such goods shall be deemed tobe sale of those goods by the person making the supply, and thepurchase of those goods by the person to whom such supply is made– As the Young Men’s Indian Assn. case and the doctrine of mutualitystate, there is no sale transaction between a club and its members –Ratio of Young Men’s Indian Assn. has not been done away with bythe limited fiction introduced by Art.366(29-A)(e) – Constitution ofIndia – Art.366(29-A) – West Bengal Sales Tax Act, 1994 – ss.2(5),(30) – Doctrine of Mutuality.Constitution of India– Art.366(29-A)(e), (f)– Applicability ofsub-clause (f) to members’ club – Held: Reason for sub-clause (f),as stated in the Statement of Objects and Reasons, is the doingaway with of two judgments of Supreme Court, viz., Associated Hotelsof India Ltd. and Northern India Caterers – This is also clear from thesubject matter of sub-clause (f) (which does not include “goods” intheir entirety, but only food or any other article for humanconsumption, or any drink), which is the serving of such food ordrink in hotels or restaurants – This is further made clear by s.6 ofthe 46th Amendment Act, which is a validation and exemptionprovision – s.6(1)(a) specifically refers to transactions referable tothe aforesaid two Supreme Court judgments – Sub-clause (a) of s.6(2) refers to 07.09.1978, which is the date on which NorthernIndia Caterers was pronounced and sub-clause (b) refers to04.01.1972, when Associated Hotels of India Ltd. was pronounced –46th Amendment Act, therefore, when read as a whole, would makeit clear that Art.366(29-A)(f) refers only to an undoing of theaforesaid two judgments, the subject matter being the taxability offood or drink served in hotels and restaurants – Thus, the taxabilityof food or drink served in members’ clubs is not the subject matterof sub-clause (f) – Subject matter of sub-clause (f) is entirelydifferent and distinct from that of sub-clause (e), and cannot possiblyapply to members’ clubs – Thus, expression “in any mannerwhatsoever”, being part and parcel of sub-clause (f) cannot beheld to extend to a supply of all goods so as to bring such goods totax when applied to members’ clubs – Constitution (Forty-sixthAmendment) Act,1982 – s.6.Income Tax Act, 1961 – ss.2(24)(vii), 44, 45(2) – Held:Doctrine of Mutuality has not been done away with by sub-clause(e) to Art.366(29-A) is also clear when sub-clause (e) is contrastedwith s.2(24)(vii) of the 1961 Act r/w s.44 – A reading of the saidprovisions make it clear that when profits and gains of a mutualinsurance company are sought to be brought to tax, they are sodone by express reference to the fact that the business of insuranceis carried on by a mutual insurance company – Absence of anysuch language in sub-clause (e) of Art.366(29-A) is also an importantpointer to the fact that the doctrine of mutuality cannot be said tohave been done away with by the said 46th Amendment – Also, s.45(2)is an example of a provision by which a deemed transfer by a personto himself gets taxed – Modalities such as these to bring to taxamounts that would do away with any doctrine of mutuality areconspicuous by their absence in the language of Article 366(29-A)(e) – Constitution of India – Art.366(29-A)(e) – Constitution (FortysixthAmendment) Act, 1982 – Doctrine of Mutuality.Words & Expressions – Expression “body of persons”occurring in the explanation to s.65 and s.65(25a) and (25aa) –Meaning of – Held:

Sales Tax Act, 1994 – ss.2(5),(30) – Doctrine of Mutuality.Constitution of India– Art.366(29-A)(e), (f)– Applicability ofsub-clause (f) to members’ club – Held: Reason for sub-clause (f),as stated in the Statement of Objects and Reasons, is the doingaway with of two judgments of Supreme Court, viz., Associated Hotelsof India Ltd. and Northern India Caterers – This is also clear from thesubject matter of sub-clause (f) (which does not include “goods” intheir entirety, but only food or any other article for humanconsumption, or any drink), which is the serving of such food ordrink in hotels or restaurants – This is further made clear by s.6 ofthe 46th Amendment Act, which is a validation and exemptionprovision – s.6(1)(a) specifically refers to transactions referable tothe aforesaid two Supreme Court judgments – Sub-clause (a) of s.6(2) refers to 07.09.1978, which is the date on which NorthernIndia Caterers was pronounced and sub-clause (b) refers to04.01.1972, when Associated Hotels of India Ltd. was pronounced –46th Amendment Act, therefore, when read as a whole, would makeit clear that Art.366(29-A)(f) refers only to an undoing of theaforesaid two judgments, the subject matter being the taxability offood or drink served in hotels and restaurants – Thus, the taxabilityof food or drink served in members’ clubs is not the subject matterof sub-clause (f) – Subject matter of sub-clause (f) is entirelydifferent and distinct from that of sub-clause (e), and cannot possiblyapply to members’ clubs – Thus, expression “in any mannerwhatsoever”, being part and parcel of sub-clause (f) cannot beheld to extend to a supply of all goods so as to bring such goods totax when applied to members’ clubs – Constitution (Forty-sixthAmendment) Act,1982 – s.6.Income Tax Act, 1961 – ss.2(24)(vii), 44, 45(2) – Held:Doctrine of Mutuality has not been done away with by sub-clause(e) to Art.366(29-A) is also clear when sub-clause (e) is contrastedwith s.2(24)(vii) of the 1961 Act r/w s.44 – A reading of the saidprovisions make it clear that when profits and gains of a mutualinsurance company are sought to be brought to tax, they are sodone by express reference to the fact that the business of insuranceis carried on by a mutual insurance company – Absence of anysuch language in sub-clause (e) of Art.366(29-A) is also an importantpointer to the fact that the doctrine of mutuality cannot be said tohave been done away with by the said 46th Amendment – Also, s.45(2)is an example of a provision by which a deemed transfer by a personto himself gets taxed – Modalities such as these to bring to taxamounts that would do away with any doctrine of mutuality areconspicuous by their absence in the language of Article 366(29-A)(e) – Constitution of India – Art.366(29-A)(e) –

Report, which preceded the enactment ofArt.366(29-A); the ‘Statement of Objects and Reasons’ appendedto the 1981 Bill, which led to the insertion of Art.366(29-A); and in particular to Art.366(29-A)(e), (f) to contend that Art.366(29-A)(e)was inserted in order to do away with the doctrine of mutuality,insofar as it applied to members’ clubs and, therefore, sought to doaway with the basis of the judgment in Young Men’s Indian Assn.case – Held: Statement of Objects and Reasons has not read thecase of Young Men’s Indian Assn. in its correct perspective – YoungMen’s Indian Assn. had three separate appeals before it, in one ofwhich a company was involved – To state, therefore, that under thelaw as it stood on the date of the 46th Amendment, a sale of goodsby a club having a corporate status to members is taxable, is whollyincorrect – Proceeding on this incorrect basis, the 46th Amendmentthen sought to bring to tax sales by clubs which have no separateexistence from that of their members – In so doing, the 46thAmendment used the expression “any unincorporated associationor body of persons” – This expression, when read with the Statementof Objects and Reasons, makes it clear that it was only clubs whichare not in corporate form that were sought to be brought within thetax net, as it was wrongly assumed that sale of goods by members’clubs in the corporate form were taxable –”Any” is the equivalentof “all”– This word, therefore, also lends itself to the aforesaidinterpretation, as the emphasis of the legislature is on allunincorporated associations or bodies being brought within subclause(e) – Constitution (Forty-sixth Amendment) Bill, 1981 –Constitution (Forty-sixth Amendment) Act, 1982 – Interpretation ofStatutes – Doctrine of Mutuality.Words & Expressions – “unincorporated association or bodyof persons” in sub-clause (e) to Art.366(29-A) – Plea on behalf ofthe appellants that the said expression must be read disjunctivelyand thus, would include incorporated persons such as companies,cooperative societies etc. – Held: On the assumption that“unincorporated association or body of persons” must be readdisjunctively, “a body of persons” cannot be equated with “person”– “Person” as defined by the General Clauses Act (which appliesto the interpretation of the Constitution vide Art.367) states that“person” shall include any company or association or body ofindividuals, whether incorporated or not – Art.366(29-A) does notuse this expression, as “person” would then include corporatepersons as well – “body of persons” is used to make it clear beyond doubt that corporate persons are not referred to – Further, contrastin the language of the 1961 Act and Art.366(29-A)(e) again leadsto the conclusion that “body of persons” would not refer to thecorporate form unless “person” by itself is accompanied by theexpression “whether incorporated or not” – Constitution of India– Art.366(29-A)(e), 367 – General Clauses Act – Income TaxAct, 1961 – s.2(31) – Interpretation of Statutes.Contract Act, 1872 – s.2(d) – Plea on behalf of the respondentthat s.2(d) makes it clear that consideration must flow from oneperson to another and in the absence of two players, as in the caseof Young Men’s Indian Assn., Art.366(29-A) would have no application– Held: “supply” of goods by an unincorporated association orbody of persons has to be to a member for cash, deferred paymentor other valuable consideration – Correctly argued by therespondents, the definition of “consideration” in s.2(d) of the 1872Act necessarily posits consideration passing from one person toanother – This is further reinforced by the last part of Art.366(29-A), as under this part, the supply of such goods shall be deemed tobe sale of those goods by the person making the supply, and thepurchase of those goods by the person to whom such supply is made– As the Young Men’s Indian Assn. case and the doctrine of mutualitystate, there is no sale transaction between a club and its members –Ratio of Young Men’s Indian Assn. has not been done away with bythe limited fiction introduced by Art.366(29-A)(e) – Constitution ofIndia – Art.366(29-A) – West Bengal Sales Tax Act, 1994 – ss.2(5),(30) – Doctrine of Mutuality.Constitution of India– Art.366(29-A)(e), (f)– Applicability ofsub-clause (f) to members’ club – Held: Reason for sub-clause (f),as stated in the Statement of Objects and Reasons, is the doingaway with of two judgments of Supreme Court, viz., Associated Hotelsof India Ltd. and Northern India Caterers – This is also clear from thesubject matter of sub-clause (f) (which does not include “goods” intheir entirety, but only food or any other article for humanconsumption, or any drink), which is the serving of such food ordrink in hotels or restaurants – This is further made clear by s.6 ofthe 46th Amendment Act, which is a validation and exemptionprovision – s.6(1)(a) specifically refers to transactions referable tothe aforesaid two

– ss.2(24)(vii), 44, 45(2) – Held:Doctrine of Mutuality has not been done away with by sub-clause(e) to Art.366(29-A) is also clear when sub-clause (e) is contrastedwith s.2(24)(vii) of the 1961 Act r/w s.44 – A reading of the saidprovisions make it clear that when profits and gains of a mutualinsurance company are sought to be brought to tax, they are sodone by express reference to the fact that

basis of the judgment in Young Men’s Indian Assn.case – Held: Statement of Objects and Reasons has not read thecase of Young Men’s Indian Assn. in its correct perspective – YoungMen’s Indian Assn. had three separate appeals before it, in one ofwhich a company was involved – To state, therefore, that under thelaw as it stood on the date of the 46th Amendment, a sale of goodsby a club having a corporate status to members is taxable, is whollyincorrect – Proceeding on this incorrect basis, the 46th Amendmentthen sought to bring to tax sales by clubs which have no separateexistence from that of their members – In so doing, the 46thAmendment used the expression “any unincorporated associationor body of persons” – This expression, when read with the Statementof Objects and Reasons, makes it clear that it was only clubs whichare not in corporate form that were sought to be brought within thetax net, as it was wrongly assumed that sale of goods by members’clubs in the corporate form were taxable –”Any” is the equivalentof “all”– This word, therefore, also lends itself to the aforesaidinterpretation, as the emphasis of the legislature is on allunincorporated associations or bodies being brought within subclause(e) – Constitution (Forty-sixth Amendment) Bill, 1981 –Constitution (Forty-sixth Amendment) Act, 1982 – Interpretation ofStatutes – Doctrine of Mutuality.Words & Expressions – “unincorporated association or bodyof persons” in sub-clause (e) to Art.366(29-A) – Plea on behalf ofthe appellants that the said expression must be read disjunctivelyand thus, would include incorporated persons such as companies,cooperative societies etc. – Held: On the assumption that“unincorporated association or body of persons” must be readdisjunctively, “a body of persons” cannot be equated with “person”– “Person” as defined by the General Clauses Act (which appliesto the interpretation of the Constitution vide Art.367) states that“person” shall include any company or association or body ofindividuals, whether incorporated or not – Art.366(29-A) does notuse this expression, as “person” would then include corporatepersons as well – “body of persons” is used to make it clear beyond doubt that corporate persons are not referred to – Further, contrastin the language of the 1961 Act and Art.366(29-A)(e) again leadsto the conclusion that “body of persons” would not refer to thecorporate form unless “person” by itself is accompanied by theexpression “whether incorporated or not” – Constitution of India– Art.366(29-A)(e), 367 – General Clauses Act – Income TaxAct, 1961 – s.2(31) – Interpretation of Statutes.Contract Act, 1872 – s.2(d) – Plea on behalf of the respondentthat s.2(d) makes it clear that consideration must flow from oneperson to another and in the absence of two players, as in the caseof Young Men’s Indian Assn., Art.366(29-A) would have no application– Held: “supply” of goods by an unincorporated association orbody of persons has to be to a member for cash, deferred paymentor other valuable consideration – Correctly argued by therespondents, the definition of “consideration” in s.2(d) of the 1872Act necessarily posits consideration passing from one person toanother – This is further reinforced by the last part of Art.366(29-A), as under this part, the supply of such goods shall be deemed tobe sale of those goods by the person making the supply, and thepurchase of those goods by the person to whom such supply is made– As the Young Men’s Indian Assn. case and the doctrine of mutualitystate, there is no sale transaction between a club and its members –Ratio of Young Men’s Indian Assn. has not been done away with bythe limited fiction introduced by Art.366(29-A)(e) – Constitution ofIndia – Art.366(29-A) – West Bengal Sales Tax Act, 1994 – ss.2(5),(30) – Doctrine of Mutuality.Constitution of India– Art.366(29-A)(e), (f)– Applicability ofsub-clause (f) to members’ club – Held: Reason for sub-clause (f),as stated in the Statement of Objects and Reasons, is the doingaway with of two judgments of Supreme Court, viz., Associated Hotelsof India Ltd. and Northern India Caterers – This is also clear from thesubject matter of sub-clause (f) (which does not include “goods” intheir entirety, but only food or any other article for humanconsumption, or any drink), which is the serving of such food ordrink in hotels or restaurants – This is further made clear by s.6 ofthe 46th Amendment Act, which is a validation and exemptionprovision – s.6(1)(a) specifically refers to transactions referable tothe aforesaid two Supreme Court judgments – Sub-clause (a) of s.6(2) refers to 07.09.1978, which is the date on which NorthernIndia Caterers was pronounced and sub-clause (b) refers to04.01.1972, when Associated Hotels of India Ltd. was pronounced –46th Amendment Act, therefore, when read as a whole, would makeit clear that Art.366(29-A)(f) refers only to an undoing of theaforesaid two judgments, the subject matter being the taxability offood or drink served in hotels and restaurants – Thus, the taxabilityof food or drink served in members’ clubs is not the subject matterof sub-clause (f) – Subject matter of sub-clause (f) is entirelydifferent and distinct from that of sub-clause (e), and cannot possiblyapply to members’ clubs – Thus, expression “in any mannerwhatsoever”, being part and parcel of sub-clause (f) cannot beheld to extend to a supply of all goods so as to bring such goods totax when applied to members’ clubs – Constitution (Forty-sixthAmendment) Act,1982 – s.6.Income Tax Act, 1961 – ss.2(24)(vii), 44, 45(2) – Held:Doctrine of Mutuality has not been done away with by sub-clause(e) to Art.366(29-A) is also clear when sub-clause (e) is contrastedwith s.2(24)(vii) of the 1961 Act r/w s.44 – A reading of the saidprovisions make it clear that when profits and gains of a mutualinsurance company are sought to be brought to tax, they are sodone by express reference to the fact that the business of insuranceis carried on by a mutual insurance company – Absence of anysuch language in sub-clause (e) of Art.366(29-A) is also an importantpointer to the fact that the doctrine of mutuality cannot be said tohave been done away with by the said 46th Amendment – Also, s.45(2)is an example of a provision by which a deemed transfer by a personto himself gets taxed – Modalities such as these to bring to taxamounts that would do away with any doctrine of mutuality areconspicuous by their absence in the language of Article 366(29-A)(e) – Constitution of India – Art.366(29-A)(e) – Constitution (FortysixthAmendment) Act, 1982 – Doctrine of Mutuality.Words & Expressions – Expression “body of persons”occurring in the explanation to s.65 and s.65(25a) and (25aa) –Meaning of – Held: Said expression does not refer to anincorporated company or an incorporated cooperative society –Finance Act, 1994 – Explanation to s. 65, ss.65(25a), (25aa);s.65B(37) and Explanation 3(a) to

No.4184 of2009, the assessee-respondent Club, registered u/s.25, 1956 Actwas issued notice informing that it had failed to make payment ofsales tax on sale of food and drinks to the permanent members –Respondent contended that there could be no sale by it to its ownpermanent members, for doctrine of mutuality would come into play– West Bengal Taxation Tribunal held that the respondent is noteligible to tax under the 1994 Act – Affirmed by the High Court –Division Bench of the Supreme Court set out inter alia 3 questions tobe answered by larger Bench, viz.(i) Whether the doctrine ofmutuality is still applicable to incorporated clubs or any club afterthe 46th Amendment to Art.366(29-A) of the Constitution of India?;(ii) Whether the judgment of Supreme Court in Young Men’s IndianAssociation case still holds the field even after the 46th Amendment?and (iii) Whether the 46th Amendment, by deeming fiction providesthat provision of food and beverages by the incorporated clubs toits permanent members constitute sale, thus liable to sales tax? – InC.A. No.7497 of 2012 and connected matters, issue involves levyingof service tax by Finance Act, 1994 upon members’ clubs, majorityof them being registered as Companies u/s.25 of the 1956 Act, or asco-operative societies under various State Acts – Held: Young Men’sIndian Assn. made no distinction between a club in the corporateform and a club by way of a registered society or incorporated by adeed of trust – What is the essence of the judgment is that the holdingof property must be a holding for and on behalf of the members ofthe club, there being no transfer of property from one person toanother – In members’ clubs there is a complete identity betweencontributors and participators – Thus, in members’ clubs there is no sale by one person to another for consideration, as one cannotsell something to oneself – What is of essence in applying thedoctrine of mutuality is that there is no sale transaction betweentwo persons, as one person cannot sell goods to itself – Ratio ofYoung Men’s Indian Assn. has not been done away with by the limitedfiction introduced by Art.366(29-A)(e) – Questions answered (i)Doctrine of mutuality continues to be applicable to incorporatedand unincorporated members’ clubs after the 46th Amendment addingArt.366(29-A); (ii) Young Men’s Indian Assn. and other judgmentswhich applied this doctrine continue to hold the field even after the46th Amendment; and (iii) Sub-clause (f) of Art.366(29-A) has noapplication to members’ clubs – No interference called for in thefindings of fact or declaration of law in this case – Further, in C.A.No.7497/12 and connected matters- Argument on behalf of therespondents that incorporated clubs or associations prior to 1st July,2012 were not included in the service tax net is accepted – Whathas been stated in the present judgment so far as sales tax isconcerned applies on all fours to service tax– Explanation 3(a) tos.65B(44) of the Finance Act, 1994 does not apply to members’clubs which are incorporated – From 2005 onwards, the FinanceAct, 1994 does not purport to levy service tax on members’ clubs inthe incorporated form – Jharkhand High Court and the GujaratHigh Court correct in their view of the law in following Young Men’sIndian Assn. Case – Thus, show-cause notices, demand notices andother action taken to levy and collect service tax from incorporatedmembers’ clubs are void and of no effect in law – West Bengal SalesTax Act, 1994

No.4184 of2009, the assessee-respondent Club, registered u/s.25, 1956 Actwas issued notice informing that it had failed to make payment ofsales tax on sale of food and drinks to the permanent members –Respondent contended that there could be no sale by it to its ownpermanent members, for doctrine of mutuality would come into play– West Bengal Taxation Tribunal held that the respondent is noteligible to tax under the 1994 Act – Affirmed by the High Court –Division Bench of the Supreme Court set out inter alia 3 questions tobe answered by larger Bench, viz.(i) Whether the doctrine ofmutuality is still applicable to incorporated clubs or any club afterthe 46th Amendment to Art.366(29-A) of the Constitution of India?;(ii) Whether the judgment of Supreme Court in Young Men’s IndianAssociation case still holds the field even after the 46th Amendment?and (iii) Whether the 46th Amendment, by deeming fiction providesthat provision of food and beverages by the incorporated clubs toits permanent members constitute sale, thus liable to sales tax? – InC.A. No.7497 of 2012 and connected matters, issue involves levyingof service tax by Finance Act, 1994 upon members’ clubs, majorityof them being registered as Companies u/s.25 of the 1956 Act, or asco-operative societies under various State Acts – Held: Young Men’sIndian Assn. made no distinction between a club in the corporateform and a club by way of a registered society or incorporated by adeed of trust – What is the essence of the judgment is that the holdingof property must be a holding for and on behalf of the members ofthe club, there being no transfer of property from one person toanother – In members’ clubs there is a complete identity betweencontributors and participators – Thus, in members’ clubs there is no sale by one person to another for consideration, as one cannotsell something to oneself – What is of essence in applying thedoctrine of mutuality is that there is no sale transaction betweentwo persons, as one person cannot sell goods to itself – Ratio ofYoung Men’s Indian Assn. has not been done away with by the limitedfiction introduced by Art.366(29-A)(e) – Questions answered (i)Doctrine of mutuality continues to be applicable to incorporatedand unincorporated members’ clubs after the 46th Amendment addingArt.366(29-A); (ii) Young Men’s Indian Assn. and other judgmentswhich applied this doctrine continue to hold the field even after the46th Amendment; and (iii) Sub-clause (f) of Art.366(29-A) has noapplication to members’ clubs – No interference called for in thefindings of fact or declaration of law in this case – Further, in C.A.No.7497/12 and connected matters- Argument on behalf of therespondents that incorporated clubs or associations prior to 1st July,2012 were not included in the service tax net is accepted – Whathas been stated in the present judgment so far as sales tax isconcerned applies on all fours to service tax– Explanation 3(a) tos.65B(44) of the Finance Act, 1994 does not apply to members’clubs which are incorporated – From 2005 onwards, the FinanceAct, 1994 does not purport to levy service tax on members’ clubs inthe incorporated form – Jharkhand High Court and the GujaratHigh Court correct in their view of the law in following Young Men’sIndian Assn. Case – Thus, show-cause notices, demand notices andother action taken to levy and collect service tax from incorporatedmembers’ clubs are void and of no effect in law – West Bengal SalesTax Act, 1994 – ss.2(5), (10), (30) & s.9 Constitution of India –Art.366(29-A)(e)(f) – Companies Act, 1956 – s.25 – Constitution(Forty-sixth Amendment) Act, 1982 – General Clauses Act – IncomeTax Act, 1961 – s.2(24)(vii), 2(31), 44, 45(2) – Finance Act, 1994 –ss.64(3), 65(25a), (25aa), 65(105)(zze), 65(A), 65B(37), Explanation3(a) to s.65B(44), 66B, 66D, 67, 68 – Finance Act, 2006 – FinanceAct, 2012 – Interpretation of Statutes – Central Sales Tax Act, 1956.Constitution of India – 46th Amendment to Art.366(29-A) –61st Law Commission Report – Plea on behalf of the appellants,referring to the said Report, which preceded the enactment ofArt.366(29-A); the ‘Statement of Objects and Reasons’ appendedto the 1981 Bill, which led to the insertion of Art.366(29-A); and in particular to Art.366(29-A)(e), (f) to contend that Art.366(29-A)(e)was inserted in order to do away with the doctrine of mutuality,insofar as it applied to members’ clubs and, therefore, sought to doaway with the basis of the judgment in Young Men’s Indian Assn.case – Held: Statement of Objects and Reasons has not read thecase of Young Men’s Indian Assn. in its correct perspective – YoungMen’s Indian Assn. had three separate appeals before it, in one ofwhich a company was involved – To state, therefore, that under thelaw as it stood on the date of the 46th Amendment, a sale of goodsby a club having a corporate status to members is taxable, is whollyincorrect – Proceeding on this incorrect basis, the 46th Amendmentthen sought to bring to tax sales by clubs which have no separateexistence from that of their members – In so doing, the 46thAmendment used the expression “any unincorporated associationor body of persons” – This expression, when read with the Statementof Objects and Reasons, makes it clear that it was only clubs whichare not in corporate form that were sought to be brought within thetax net, as it was wrongly assumed that sale of goods by members’clubs in the corporate form were taxable –”Any” is the equivalentof “all”– This word, therefore, also lends itself to the aforesaidinterpretation, as the emphasis of the legislature is on allunincorporated associations or bodies being brought within subclause(e) – Constitution (Forty-sixth Amendment) Bill, 1981 –Constitution (Forty-sixth Amendment) Act, 1982 – Interpretation ofStatutes – Doctrine of Mutuality.Words & Expressions – “unincorporated association or bodyof persons” in sub-clause (e) to Art.366(29-A) – Plea on behalf ofthe appellants that the said expression must be read disjunctivelyand thus, would include incorporated persons such as companies,cooperative societies etc. – Held: On the assumption that“unincorporated association or body of persons” must be readdisjunctively, “a body of persons” cannot be equated with “person”– “Person” as defined by the General Clauses Act (which appliesto the interpretation of the Constitution vide Art.367) states that“person” shall include any company or association or body ofindividuals, whether incorporated or not – Art.366(29-A) does notuse this expression, as “person” would then include corporatepersons as well – “body of persons” is used to make it clear beyond doubt that corporate persons are not referred to – Further, contrastin the language of the 1961 Act and Art.366(29-A)(e) again leadsto the conclusion that “body of persons” would not refer to thecorporate form unless “person” by itself is accompanied by theexpression “whether incorporated or not” – Constitution of India– Art.366(29-A)(e), 367 – General Clauses Act – Income TaxAct, 1961 – s.2(31) – Interpretation of Statutes.Contract Act, 1872 – s.2(d) – Plea on behalf of the respondentthat s.2(d) makes it clear that consideration must flow from oneperson to another and in the absence of two players, as in the caseof Young Men’s Indian Assn., Art.366(29-A) would have no application– Held: “supply” of goods by an unincorporated association orbody of persons has to be to a member for cash, deferred paymentor other valuable consideration – Correctly argued by therespondents, the definition of “consideration” in s.2(d) of the 1872Act necessarily posits consideration passing from one person toanother – This is further reinforced by the last part of Art.366(29-A), as under this part, the supply of such goods shall be deemed tobe sale of those goods by the person making the supply, and thepurchase of those goods by the person to whom such supply is made– As the Young Men’s Indian Assn. case and the doctrine of mutualitystate, there is no sale transaction between a club and its members –Ratio of Young Men’s Indian Assn. has not been done away with bythe limited fiction introduced by Art.366(29-A)(e) – Constitution ofIndia – Art.366(29-A) – West Bengal Sales Tax Act, 1994 – ss.2(5),(30) – Doctrine of Mutuality.Constitution of India– Art.366(29-A)(e), (f)– Applicability ofsub-clause (f) to members’ club – Held: Reason for sub-clause (f),as stated in the Statement of Objects and Reasons, is the doingaway with of two judgments of Supreme Court, viz., Associated Hotelsof India Ltd. and Northern India Caterers – This is also clear from thesubject matter of sub-clause (f) (which does not include “goods” intheir entirety, but only food or any other article for humanconsumption, or any drink), which is the serving of such food ordrink in hotels or restaurants – This is further made clear by s.6 ofthe 46th Amendment Act, which is a validation and exemptionprovision – s.6(1)(a) specifically refers to transactions referable tothe aforesaid two Supreme Court judgments – Sub-clause (a) of s.6(2) refers to 07.09.1978, which is the date on which NorthernIndia Caterers was pronounced and sub-clause (b) refers to04.01.1972, when Associated Hotels of India Ltd. was pronounced –46th Amendment Act, therefore, when read as a whole, would makeit clear that Art.366(29-A)(f) refers only to an undoing of theaforesaid two judgments, the subject matter being the taxability offood or drink served in hotels and restaurants – Thus, the taxabilityof food or drink served in members’ clubs is not the subject matterof sub-clause (f) – Subject matter of sub-clause (f) is entirelydifferent and distinct from that of sub-clause (e), and cannot possiblyapply to members’ clubs – Thus, expression “in any mannerwhatsoever”, being part and parcel of sub-clause (f) cannot beheld to extend to a supply of all goods so as to bring such goods totax when applied to members’ clubs – Constitution (Forty-sixthAmendment) Act,1982 – s.6.Income Tax Act, 1961 – ss.2(24)(vii), 44, 45(2) – Held:Doctrine of Mutuality has not been done away with by sub-clause(e) to Art.366(29-A) is also clear when sub-clause (e) is contrastedwith s.2(24)(vii) of the 1961 Act r/w s.44 – A reading of the saidprovisions make it clear that when profits and gains of a mutualinsurance company are sought to be brought to tax, they are sodone by express reference to the fact that the business of insuranceis carried on by a mutual insurance company – Absence of anysuch language in sub-clause (e) of Art.366(29-A) is also an importantpointer to the fact that the doctrine of mutuality cannot be said tohave been done away with by the said 46th Amendment – Also, s.45(2)is an example of a provision by which a deemed transfer by a personto himself gets taxed – Modalities such as these to bring to taxamounts that would do away with any doctrine of mutuality areconspicuous by their absence in the language of Article 366(29-A)(e) – Constitution of India – Art.366(29-A)(e) – Constitution (FortysixthAmendment) Act, 1982 – Doctrine of Mutuality.Words & Expressions – Expression “body of persons”occurring in the explanation to s.65 and s.65(25a) and (25aa) –Meaning of – Held: Said expression does not refer to anincorporated company or an incorporated cooperative society –Finance Act, 1994 – Explanation to s. 65, ss.65(25a), (25aa);s.65B(37) and Explanation 3(a) to s.65B(44) – Finance Act, 2006 Finance Act, 1994 – Explanation to s.65, ss.65(25a), (25aa);s.65B(37) and Explanation 3(a) to s.65B(44) – Applicability ofexplanation 3(a) to s.65B(44) to incorporated
