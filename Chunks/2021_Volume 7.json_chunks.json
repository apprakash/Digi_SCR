        "HeadNote": "Bank of Cochin Service Code: Clause 22(ix)(a) Chapter VIII – Violation of – Disciplinary proceedings against the Bank Manager for sanctioning advances in violation of the Head Office instructions causing financial loss to the Bank – Bank manager not allowed to be represented by an office bearer of an employees association of another organisation – Thereafter, Manager dismissed from service – Challenge to, after almost four and a half years – Both the Single Judge as also the Division Bench of the High Court quashed the disciplinary proceedings against the Bank Manager – On appeal, held: Observations and findings in the disciplinary proceedings on the aspect of irregularities regarding exceeding his authority in the grant of advances, clear and undisputed – Bank Manager was aware that his request to be represented by a representative of his own choice had been rejected – Even then he took time and decided not to file an appeal before the Board of Directors against the order of the inquiry officer rejecting his request – On the alibi, the Manager did not furnish any details or particulars of cases or instances and had refused to lead evidence – As per Clause 22(ix)(a), an officer can also be permitted to be defended by a representative of a registered union/association of ‘bank’ employees, which means an union/association of the employees of the Bank of Cochin and not of any or other banks – Provision does not stipulate that the employee requires permission from any authority or the inquiry officer for representation – Furthermore, the dismissal order remained unchallenged for more than four years – Though the Service Code does not stipulate any time period within which the appeal may be preferred but it should be within a reasonable time depending upon the facts and circumstances of each case – Right not exercised for a long time is non-existent – Doctrine of delay and laches as well as acquiescence are applied to non-suit such litigants – In the instant case, challenge to the order of dismissalfrom service by way of appeal was after four years, which was highly belated and beyond justifiable time – Court is to consciously examine whether a party has chosen to sit over the matter and has woken up to gain any advantage and benefit – These facets, when proven, must be factored and balanced, even when there is delay and laches on the part of the authorities – Studied silence of the respondent, was with an ulterior motive as he wanted to take benefit of the slipup though he had suffered dismissal – Thus, the judgment passed by the High Court is set aside and the order of dismissal is upheld – Service law. Clause 22(ix)(a), 2(e) – Object of definition clauses – Held: Is to avoid frequent repetition in describing the subject matter to which the word or expression is intended to apply – This is useful when the same word or expression is used more than once in the same enactment – Definition can be with the intent to attract a meaning already established by law; expand the meaning by adding a meaning; or narrow the meaning by exclusion – Repugnancy will arise when the definition meaning does not agree with the subject in the context – On facts, repugnancy not indicated and does not arise in the context of Clause 22(ix)(a) by mere absence of article ‘the’ in Clause 22(ix)(a) before the word ‘bank’. Inquiry: Domestic inquiry – Choice of representation – Right of – Held: Right to be represented by a counsel or agent of one’s choice is not an absolute right but can be controlled or regulated by law, rules, or regulations – However, if the charge is of severe and complex nature, then the request to be represented through a counsel or agent should be considered – Said proposition flows from the entitlement of fair hearing, applicable in judicial as well as quasi-judicial decisions. ‘Acquiescence’ and ‘delay and laches’ – Distinction between – Held: Doctrine of acquiescence is an equitable doctrine which applies when a party having a right stands by and sees another dealing in a manner inconsistent with that right – Acquiescence virtually destroys the right of the person – However, both limitation and laches destroy the remedy but not the right – Laches like acquiescence is based upon equitable considerations, but laches unlike acquiescence imports even simple passivity – On facts, inactive acquiescence on the part of the Bank Manager can beinferred till the filing of the appeal, and not for the period post filing of the appeal – Nevertheless, this acquiescence being in the nature of estoppel bars the Bank Manager from claiming violation of the right of fair representation.  Administrative law: Statutory authority – Non-performance of duty – Defence of delay and laches – Held: When the statutory authority does not perform its duty within a reasonable time, the same cannot be justified by taking the plea that the person deprived of his rights has not approached the appropriate forum for relief – Statutory authority cannot take the defence of laches and delay.",

A Constitution of India: Arts. 226 and 227 – Writ petition – Petition u/Art. 227 filed against an order of the Wakf Tribunal before the High Court – Petition titled as writ petition – Jurisdiction of High Court – Held: Nomenclature of the title of the petition filed before the High Court is immaterial – It is wholly immaterial that it is titled as a writ petition – Petition styled as one u/Art. 226 would not bar the High Court to exercise jurisdiction under the Act and/or u/ Art. 227 – In certain High Courts, petition u/Art. 227 is titled as writ petition and in certain other High Courts as revision petition or as miscellaneous petition – On facts, keeping in view the nature of the order passed in the light of proviso to sub-section (9) of s. 83 of the Act, the High Court exercised jurisdiction only under the Act, which was restricted to only examine the correctness, legality or propriety of the findings recorded by the Wakf Tribunal – Wakf Act, 1995 – ss. 85, 85A, 83(9).",

        "HeadNote": "Hindu Law: Hindu joint family property – Presumption of – Held: There can be presumption of Hindu joint family property if the property has been acquired by the male member or if the same has been treated as joint Hindu family – However, no such presumption is attached to a business activity carried out by an individual in a tenanted premise – Even if a male member had taken premises on rent, he is tenant in his individual capacity and not as Karta of Hindu Undivided Family in the absence of any evidence that Karta was doing the business for and on behalf of Joint Hindu Family – Hindu Joint Hindu Family cannot be presumed to be in existence only on the basis of Ration Card and payment of rent unless there is evidence that the funds of joint Hindu Family were invested in the business in the tenanted premises – On facts, High Court held that the payment of rent or the Ration Card proves that the tenant was carrying business as a Joint Hindu Family Business, and also rejected the surrender of tenancy – Facts would show that it was the contract of tenancy which was inherited by the grandfather of the plaintiff who later surrendered it in favour of the Wakf Board – Even if the great grandfather was maintaining the family out of the income generated from the hotel business, that itself would not make the other family members as coparceners in the hotel business – Tenancy was an individual right vested with the grandfather of the plaintiff who was competent to surrender it to the landlord – Thus, the order by the High Court that the tenant in the premises was representing a joint Hindu family and that the Karta was not competent to surrender the legacy rights in favour of Wakf Board and consequently the induction of the appellant as a tenant by the Wakf Board was illegal and thus, issuance of direction to dispossess the appellant from the suit premises and to handover the vacant possession to the plaintiff, is not sustainable and set aside, and that of the Wakf Tribunal is restored – Wakf Act, 1995 – ss. 85, 85A, 83(9). A Constitution of India: Arts. 226 and 227 – Writ petition – Petition u/Art. 227 filed against an order of the Wakf Tribunal before the High Court – Petition titled as writ petition – Jurisdiction of High Court – Held: Nomenclature of the title of the petition filed before the High Court is immaterial – It is wholly immaterial that it is titled as a writ petition – Petition styled as one u/Art. 226 would not bar the High Court to exercise jurisdiction under the Act and/or u/ Art. 227 – In certain High Courts, petition u/Art. 227 is titled as writ petition and in certain other High Courts as revision petition or as miscellaneous petition – On facts, keeping in view the nature of the order passed in the light of proviso to sub-section (9) of s. 83 of the Act, the High Court exercised jurisdiction only under the Act, which was restricted to only examine the correctness, legality or propriety of the findings recorded by the Wakf Tribunal – Wakf Act, 1995 – ss. 85, 85A, 83(9).",

Service law: Upgradation and Promotion – Difference between – Held: There is a vast difference between the upgradation and the promotion – Ordinarily upgradation of a post would involve transfer of a post from lower to higher grade and placement of an incumbent of that post in the higher grade – Such placement would not involve any selection process to be followed, but would merely confer a financial benefit by raising the scale of pay of the post – However, in case of promotion, there would be an advancement to a higher position or rank along with an advancement to a highergrade – Therefore, the word “promotion” would mean advancement or preferment in honour, dignity, rank and grade.",

Service law: Upgradation and Promotion – Difference between – Held: There is a vast difference between the upgradation and the promotion – Ordinarily upgradation of a post would involve transfer of a post from lower to higher grade and placement of an incumbent of that post in the higher grade – Such placement would not involve any selection process to be followed, but would merely confer a financial benefit by raising the scale of pay of the post – However, in case of promotion, there would be an advancement to a higher position or rank along with an advancement to a highergrade – Therefore, the word “promotion” would mean advancement or preferment in honour, dignity, rank and grade.",

State of U.P. – Held: The case of Mangu and Ors., notification u/s. 4 of the Act was issued in the year 1991, but in the present case the notification u/s. 4 of the Act was issued in the year 1976 – The said judgment and order passed by the High Court in the case of Mangu and Ors. cannot be said to be comparable because of the time gap of approximately 15 years between the dates of acquisition – The claimants in the present case cannot claim the compensation @ Rs.297/- per square yard relying upon the decision in the case of Mangu and Ors. with regard to the acquisition of the year 1991 – However, in the case of Jagmal Vs. State of U.P., the High Court noted and determined the compensation @ Rs.28.12 paisa per square yard and same was confirmed by the Supreme Court – Therefore, as such at the most, the claimants can be said to be entitled to compensation @ Rs.28.12 paisa per square yard with regard to the lands acquired in the year 1976-1977.",
