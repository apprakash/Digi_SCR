Specific Relief Act, 1963: s.16(c) – Suit for specific performance of the agreement to sell – Both, the Trial Court as well as the First Appellate Court held all the issues in favour of the plaintiff including the issue that the plaintiff was always ready and willing to perform his part of contract – However, High Court in exercise of powers under s.100 of the CPC reversed the concurrent findings recorded by both the Courts below on readiness and willingness, solely on the ground that there were no specific averments in the plaint required as per s.16(c) of the Act – High Court also allowed the appeal on the ground that the relief of specific performance is the discretionary relief under s.20 of the Act and that even though the execution of the agreement to sell is proved and even the plaintiff was found to be always ready and willing to perform his part of the obligation under the agreement to sell, the decree of specific performance is not automatic and such grant of decree is dependent upon the principles of justice, equity and good conscience – On appeal, held: High Court committed a grave error in holding the issue with respect to readiness and willingness against the plaintiff solely on the ground that there were no specific averments/pleadings in the plaint as required under s.16(c) of the Act – The fact that initially payment of Rs.25,000/- was made at the time of execution of the agreement to sell and further sum of Rs.15,000/- in two installments were paid at the time when the subsequent two documents were executed for extension of time and even the time was extended at the instance of defendant No.1 and the balance amount of Rs.16,000/- was to be paid at the time of execution of the sale deed proved that the plaintiff was always ready and willing to perform his part of the contract under the agreement to sell – Suit for specific performance of agreement of sell decreed. Code of Civil Procedure, 1908: s.100 – Scope of interference – Held: There were concurrent findings of fact recorded by Trial Court as well as First Appellate Court on readiness and willingness on the part of the plaintiff, which were on appreciation of evidence on record – Therefore, in exercise of powers under s.100 of the CPC, High Court ought not to have interfered with such findings of fact unless such findings are found to be perverse – The findings recorded by the Trial Court as well as the First Appellate Court on readiness and willingness on the part of the plaintiff showed that they were not perverse and/or contrary to the evidence on record – On the contrary, High Court had ignored the necessary aspects on readiness and willingness including the conduct on the part of the parties – Specific Relief Act, 1963 – s.16(c).",

        "HeadNote": "Specific Relief Act, 1963: s.20 – Discretion under – Exercise of, scope – Held: Discretion under s.20 of the Act is required to be exercised judiciously, soundly and reasonably – Plaintiff cannot be punished by refusing the relief of specific performance despite the fact that the execution of the agreement to sell in his favour was established and proved and that he was found to be always ready and willing to perform his part of the contract – Not to grant the decree of specific performance despite the execution of the agreement to sell and part sale consideration having been proved and the plaintiff being always ready and willing to perform his part of the contract would encourage the dishonesty – In such a situation, the balance should tilt in favour of the plaintiff rather than in favour of the defendant-executant of the agreement to sell, while exercising the discretion judiciously. Specific Relief Act, 1963: s.16(c) – Suit for specific performance of the agreement to sell – Both, the Trial Court as well as the First Appellate Court held all the issues in favour of the plaintiff including the issue that the plaintiff was always ready and willing to perform his part of contract – However, High Court in exercise of powers under s.100 of the CPC reversed the concurrent findings recorded by both the Courts below on readiness and willingness, solely on the ground that there were no specific averments in the plaint required as per s.16(c) of the Act – High Court also allowed the appeal on the ground that the relief of specific performance is the discretionary relief under s.20 of the Act and that even though the execution of the agreement to sell is proved and even the plaintiff was found to be always ready and willing to perform his part of the obligation under the agreement to sell, the decree of specific performance is not automatic and such grant of decree is dependent upon the principles of justice, equity and good conscience – On appeal, held: High Court committed a grave error in holding the issue with respect to readiness and willingness against the plaintiff solely on the ground that there were no specific averments/pleadings in the plaint as required under s.16(c) of the Act – The fact that initially payment of Rs.25,000/- was made at the time of execution of the agreement to sell and further sum of Rs.15,000/- in two installments were paid at the time when the subsequent two documents were executed for extension of time and even the time was extended at the instance of defendant No.1 and the balance amount of Rs.16,000/- was to be paid at the time of execution of the sale deed proved that the plaintiff was always ready and willing to perform his part of the contract under the agreement to sell – Suit for specific performance of agreement of sell decreed. Code of Civil Procedure, 1908: s.100 – Scope of interference – Held: There were concurrent findings of fact recorded by Trial Court as well as First Appellate Court on readiness and willingness on the part of the plaintiff, which were on appreciation of evidence on record – Therefore, in exercise of powers under s.100 of the CPC, High Court ought not to have interfered with such findings of fact unless such findings are found to be perverse – The findings recorded by the Trial Court as well as the First Appellate Court on readiness and willingness on the part of the plaintiff showed that they were not perverse and/or contrary to the evidence on record – On the contrary, High Court had ignored the necessary aspects on readiness and willingness including the conduct on the part of the parties – Specific Relief Act, 1963 – s.16(c).",

Contempt of Courts Act, 1971 – Standard of proof – Held: Proof beyond reasonable doubt is required since the proceedings are quasi-criminal in nature. Contempt of Court – Disputed questions of facts – Held: While dealing with a contempt petition, the Court is not expected to conduct a roving inquiry and go beyond the very judgment which was allegedly violated – Said principle has to be applied with more vigor when disputed questions of facts are involved.",

Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973: s.482 – Scope of – Held: High Court has inherent power to act ex debito justitiae i.e., to do real and substantial justice, or to prevent abuse of the process of the Court – The powers being very wide in itself imposes a solemn duty on the Courts, requiring great caution in its exercise – The Court must be careful to see that its decision in exercise of this power is based on sound principles – The inherent power vested in the Court should not be exercised to stifle a legitimate prosecution – However, the inherent power or the extra-ordinary power conferred upon the High Court, entitles the said Court to quash a proceeding, if it comes to the conclusion that allowing the proceeding to continue would be an abuse of the process of the Court, or the ends of justice require that the proceeding ought to be quashed. Penal Code, 1860: s.306 – Abetment of suicide – Essential ingredients – There must be an allegation of either direct or indirect act of incitement to the commission of offence of suicide and mere allegations of harassment of the deceased by another person would not be sufficient in itself, unless, there are allegations of such actions on the part of the accused which compelled the commission of suicide.",

Penal Code, 1860: s.375 – Distinction between ‘preparation’ and ‘attempt’ to commit an offence – There is a visible distinction between ‘preparation’ and ‘attempt’ to commit an offence and it all depends on the statutory edict coupled with the nature of evidence produced in a case – The stage of ‘preparation’ consists of deliberation, devising or arranging the means or measures, which would be necessary for commission of offence – Whereas, an ‘attempt’ to commit the offence, starts immediately after the completion of preparation – ‘Attempt’ is the execution of mens rea after preparation – ‘Attempt’ starts where ‘preparation’ comes to an end, though it falls short of actual commission of the crime.",

Penal Code, 1860: s.375 – Distinction between ‘preparation’ and ‘attempt’ to commit an offence – There is a visible distinction between ‘preparation’ and ‘attempt’ to commit an offence and it all depends on the statutory edict coupled with the nature of evidence produced in a case – The stage of ‘preparation’ consists of deliberation, devising or arranging the means or measures, which would be necessary for commission of offence – Whereas, an ‘attempt’ to commit the offence, starts immediately after the completion of preparation – ‘Attempt’ is the execution of mens rea after preparation – ‘Attempt’ starts where ‘preparation’ comes to an end, though it falls short of actual commission of the crime.",

Constitution of India: Art.142 – Powers to quash the proceedings, scope of – Ordinarily, when dealing with offences arising out of special statutes such as the SC/ST Act, the Court will be extremely circumspect in its approach – The SC/ST Act has been specifically enacted to deter acts of indignity, humiliation and harassment against members of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes – Where it appears to the Court that the offence although covered under the SC/ST Act, is primarily private or civil in nature, or where the alleged offence has not been committed on account of the caste of the victim, or where the continuation of the legal proceedings would be an abuse of the process of law, the Court can exercise its powers to quash the proceedings – Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989. Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989: Object of the Act – Held: The SC/ST Act has been specifically enacted to deter acts of indignity, humiliation and harassment against members of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes – The Act is also a recognition of the depressing reality that despite undertaking several measures, the Scheduled Castes/ Scheduled Tribes continue to be subjected to various atrocities at the hands of upper-castes – The Act has been enacted keeping in view the express constitutional safeguards enumerated in Arts.15, 17 and 21 of the Constitution, with a twin-fold objective of protecting the members of these vulnerable communities as well as to provide relief and rehabilitation to the victims of caste-based atrocities – Constitution of India – Arts.15, 17 and 21.",

XXI, r.94 would show that it passes through three important stages (other than certain intervening stages), conduct of sale; sale becoming absolute; and issue of sale certificate – After all these three stages are crossed, the fourth stage of delivery of possession comes under r.95 of Or.XXI – It is at this fourth stage that the appellants have raised the objection relating to Or.XXI, r.64 – It is not as if the judgment debtor was not aware of the fact that the property in entirety was included in the proclamation of sale – Therefore, the claim on the basis of Or.XXI, r. 64 was rightly rejected by the High Court.  Code of Civil Procedure, 1908: s.11 – Applicability of, to execution proceedings – Original judgment debtor filed a petition under s.47, way back on 02.09.1975 – Second petition under s.47 thus will be barred by res judicata – Before Act 104 of 1976 came into force, there was one view that the provisions of s.11 of the Code had no application to execution proceedings – But under Act 104 of 1976 Explanation VII was inserted under s.11 and it says that the provisions of this Section shall apply to a proceeding for the execution of a decree and reference in this Section to any suit, issue or former suit shall be construed as references to a proceeding for the execution of the decree, question arising in such proceeding and a former proceeding for the execution of that decree – Res judicata.",

        "HeadNote": "Andhra Pradesh Tenancy (Andhra Area) Act – ss.14, 15 and 16 – The appellant-tenant claimed the cultivating tenant’s right to first purchase the land leased to him – Dispute arose between the appellant and first respondent-landlord – The appellant had approached the Tribunal claiming various reliefs u/s. 16 (1) of the Andhra Pradesh Tenancy (Andhra Area) Act i.e. for declaratory relief that the price of the schedule land i.e., ` 1,25,000/per acre is reasonable and stood accepted by the first respondent by receiving the first instalment of ` 49,125/- by demand draft; that he was entitled to pay the balance sale price of ` 4,42,125/- to first respondent in nine instalments; for a declaration that two registered sale deed documents executed by first respondent in favour of the second and third respondents are void – The Tribunal, upheld the appellant’s claim and held that the appellant had never surrendered the tenancy; that the compromise which was arrived at between the landlords and that his possession as a cultivating tenant remained undisturbed – Consequently, he was entitled to the purchase rights as the law allowed – The District Court held that the relief granted by the Tribunal was untenable as the appellant had surrendered the tenancy – The High Court concurred with the Tribunal – On appeal, held: The twin conditions that make a valid surrender of tenancy are firstly, three months’ notice in writing to the landlord, and the Special Officer about the intention to surrender the tenancy, and secondly, satisfaction recorded by the Special Officer in an order, after due inquiry about the voluntary nature of the surrender of tenancy – Neither first respondent nor the other contesting respondents (who purchased the lands from her) pleaded or proved that notice in writing was issued to them by the appellant, followed by inquiry conducted by the Special Officer, culminating in an order accepting such alleged surrender – Further, the order passed in the compromise petition, clearly recorded, in more than one place, that the lease between the appellant on the one hand, and first respondent, on the other, was subsisting and continuing – Therefore, clearly, the findings of the District Judge and the High Court, regarding surrender (either in part or fully) of the tenancy, are wholly untenable – As far as agreement to purchase land is concerned, the particulars of the demand drafts, and the registered sale deeds, were exhibited during the proceedings – These were incontrovertible facts – Having regard to these facts, appellant’s further case was that a sum of ` 49,125/- was paid as first of the nine instalments, the balance being ` 4,42,000/-. Ex. P-12 was the covering letter enclosing a demand draft dated 26-09-2003 – That document categorically referred to the sale transaction, clearly spelling out that the amount was towards an instalment payable as consideration for purchase of property – The District Judge and the High Court could not have upset the order of the tribunal as regards the appellant’s exercise of right to purchase the property, u/s. 15 – Therefore, the impugned order of the High Court, as well as the judgment of the District Court, are set aside.",

Vigilance Manual, 2008: Rule 3.16 – While considering the prima facie case for the purpose of registering the FIR, some enquiry/ investigation is bound to be there, however, the same shall be only for the purpose of finding out a prima facie case for the purpose of registration of the FIR only – Whatever enquiry is conducted at the stage of Preliminary Enquiry, by no stretch of imagination, will be considered as investigation under the Code of Criminal Procedure which can only be after registration of the FIR – Even otherwise, merely because while holding a Preliminary Enquiry a detailed enquiry is made into the allegations made against the respondent which can be said to be only for the purpose of finding out a prima facie case for the purpose of registration of the FIR and merely because some more time is taken in conducting the Preliminary Enquiry before registering the FIR, the entire criminal proceedings cannot be quashed – There shall not be any prejudice caused to the accused at the stage of holding Preliminary Enquiry which shall only be for the purpose of satisfying whether any prima facie case is made out with respect to the allegations made in the complaint which requires further investigation after registering the FIR or not – Therefore, the High Court has materially erred in holding and declaring Clause 3.16 as ultra vires. Liability: Vicariously liability of respondent in the absence of main conspirators – Allegations against the respondent are in respect of his individual capacity – Therefore, there is no question of any vicarious liability.

        "HeadNote": "J&K Prevention of Corruption Act, 2006: s.3, second proviso, s.5(1)(d) r/w 5(2) – Authorisation by Senior Superintendent of Police to the inspector to enquire into the FIR for the offences under ss.5(1)(d) r/w 5(2) of the J&K PC Act, 2006 and s.120-B of the Ranbir Penal Code, legality of – Requirement to give reasons in the authorisation – Held: It cannot be said that there was non- application of mind on the part of the Senior Superintendent of Police authorising the inspector to enquire into the FIR for the stated offences – The inspector who was authorised to investigate the FIR for the said offences was also authorised to arrest the accused persons whenever and wherever necessary – In the said authorisation, it was specifically mentioned that he will conduct the investigation of the case under the supervision of the Superintendent of Police – Therefore, all precautions were taken by the Senior Superintendent of Police authorising the Inspector to investigate the FIR – Even otherwise, a plain reading of the second proviso to s.3 shows that only two requirements are required to be satisfied, namely, (i) authorisation in writing by an officer of the Vigilance Organisation not below the rank of Assistant Superintendent of Police to an officer of not below the rank of Sub-Inspector of Police to investigate such offences; and (ii) such officer authorised may investigate the offences so specified in the order of authorisation – Therefore, as such, there is no requirement of giving either special reasons nor there is requirement to mention reasons – What is required to be considered is whether there is an application of mind with respect to offences and the relevant provisions with respect to authorisation – Considering the above authorisation, it cannot be said that such authorisation authorising inspector to investigate the FIR can be said to be vitiated and/or can be said to be void which warrants quashing of the entire criminal proceedings including the FIR – Ranbir Penal Code – s.120-B.J&K Prevention of Corruption Act, 2006: s.155 – Non- compliance of – By impugned order, High Court observed that for an investigating agency to investigate the group of offences which include the non-cognizable one, it must obtain a sanction from the concerned Magistrate before launching the investigation and in the instant case no such sanction from the concerned Magistrate was obtained – Propriety – Held: The substantive offences against the respondent were under J&K PC Act, 2006 and as per s.3 of the Act, all offences under the Act are cognizable and non-bailable – As such, the said issue is squarely covered against the respondent in view of the decision of this Court in the case of Pravin Chandra Mody wherein it was held that where the information discloses a cognizable as well as a non-cognizable offence, the police officer is not debarred from investigating any non-cognizable offence which may arise out of the same facts and he can include that non- cognizable offence in the charge-sheet which he presents for a cognizable offence – The offence under the Prevention of Corruption Act is a substantive offence and the investigation in respect of the offence under the PC Act, when considered and coupled with the offence of conspiracy, there is no requirement of prior sanction of the Magistrate – Merely because the offence of the conspiracy may be involved, investigation into the offence under the PC Act which is cognizable is not required to await a sanction from the Magistrate, as that would lead to a considerable delay and affect the investigation and it will derail the investigation – Therefore, the High Court erred in quashing the criminal proceedings on the ground that the offence under s.120B is a non-cognizable, prior sanction as required under s.155 of J&K Cr.P.C. is not obtained.Vigilance Manual, 2008: Rule 3.16 – Validity of – A close reading of Rule 3.16 showed that the same can be said to be in the interest of the accused and/or a person against whom the allegations are made and to safeguard the accused against frivolous complaints – As per Clause 3.16 only after the Preliminary Enquiry is conducted and there is a prima facie case found, an FIR is required to be registered – Considering the nature of offences, a detailed enquiry is required and therefore it is observed in Clause 3.16 that a PE should be completed normally within a period of six months – As per the law laid down in the case of Lalita Kumari, a detailed investigation into the allegations on merits is not required by holding Preliminary Enquiry and that such enquiry is to be completed within a period of seven days, however, it is not held that if the Preliminary Enquiry is not completed within a period of seven days, the entire criminal proceedings would be void and the same are to be quashed – Rule 3.16 can be said to be in consonance with the observations and the law laid down by this Court in the case of Lalita Kumari. Vigilance Manual, 2008: Rule 3.16 – While considering the prima facie case for the purpose of registering the FIR, some enquiry/ investigation is bound to be there, however, the same shall be only for the purpose of finding out a prima facie case for the purpose of registration of the FIR only – Whatever enquiry is conducted at the stage of Preliminary Enquiry, by no stretch of imagination, will be considered as investigation under the Code of Criminal Procedure which can only be after registration of the FIR – Even otherwise, merely because while holding a Preliminary Enquiry a detailed enquiry is made into the allegations made against the respondent which can be said to be only for the purpose of finding out a prima facie case for the purpose of registration of the FIR and merely because some more time is taken in conducting the Preliminary Enquiry before registering the FIR, the entire criminal proceedings cannot be quashed – There shall not be any prejudice caused to the accused at the stage of holding Preliminary Enquiry which shall only be for the purpose of satisfying whether any prima facie case is made out with respect to the allegations made in the complaint which requires further investigation after registering the FIR or not – Therefore, the High Court has materially erred in holding and declaring Clause 3.16 as ultra vires. Liability: Vicariously liability of respondent in the absence of main conspirators – Allegations against the respondent are in respect of his individual capacity – Therefore, there is no question of any vicarious liability.

Motor Vehicles Act, 1988: Multiplier – Deceased at the time of accident was aged between 21-22 years – Therefore, the multiplier has to be adopted/applied considering the age of the deceased and not the age of the parents thus, multiplier 18 would apply. Motor Vehicles Act, 1988: Entitlement of claimants to Just Compensation – The claimants are entitled to just compensation – Merely because in the execution proceedings they might have accepted the amount as awarded by the High Court, may be as full and final settlement, it shall not take away the right of the claimants to claim just compensation and shall not preclude them from claiming the enhanced amount of compensation which they as such are held to be entitled to – As such, the Motor Vehicles Act is a benevolent Act and the claimants are entitled to just compensation.

National Green Tribunal Act, 2010: Interpretation of – Purposive interpretation – The provision must be read with the intention to accentuate them, especially as they concern protections of rights under Art.21 and also deal with vital environmental policy and its regulatory aspects. National Green Tribunal Act, 2010: Salient features – Discussed. National Green Tribunal Act, 2010: Role of National Green Tribunal – The Schedule I of the NGT Act is concerned with implementation of few environmental related enactments such as the Water Act, the Air Act, the Environment Act, the Forest Conservation Act etc – As one looks at these enactments, an expanded role for the NGT is clearly discernible – The activities of the NGT are not only geared towards the protection of the environment but also to ensure that the developments do not cause serious and irreparable damage to the ecology and the environment – NGT is primarily concerned with protection of the environment and also preservation of the natural resources – As the specialized forum, the NGT would be expected to take preventive action, besides settling and adjudicating disputes and pass orders on all environment related questions – NGT is not just an adjudicatory body but has to perform wider functions in the nature of prevention, remedy and amelioration. National Green Tribunal Act, 2010: Power of National Green Tribunal – In case of environmental events causing damage – The NGT is empowered to carry out restitutive exercise for compensating persons adversely affected by environmental events – The larger discourse which informs such functions is related to distributive and corrective justice – Even in the absence of harm inflicted by human agency, in a situation of a natural calamity, the NGT will be required to devise a plan for alleviating damage – An inquisitorial function is also available for the NGT, within and without adversarial significance – Many of these functions do not require an active “dispute”, but the formulation of decisions. National Green Tribunal: Suo motu power, exercise of – The specialized tribunal’s exercise of suo motu powers is somewhat distinct from those exercised by the constitutional Courts – The Supreme Court and High Courts can foray into any issues under their constitutional mandate but the NGT cannot naturally travel beyond its environmental domain in reference to the scheduled enactments – However, as long as the sphere of action is not breached, the NGT’s powers must be understood to be of the widest amplitude. National Green Tribunal: Uniqueness of NGT vis-a-vis other Tribunals – The statutory Tribunals are categorized to fall under four subheads; Administrative Tribunals under Art.323A; Tribunals under Art.323B; Specialized sector Tribunals and most prominently; Tribunals to safeguard rights under Art.21 – The duties of NGT brings it within the ambit of the fourth category, creating a compelling proposition for wielding much broader powers as delineated by the statute. National Green Tribunal: Sui Generis role of NGT – NGT is a specialised forum – The NGT is a Tribunal with sui generis characteristic, with the special and all-encompassing jurisdiction to protect the environment – Besides its adjudicatory role as an appellate authority, it is also conferred with the responsibility to discharge role of supervisory body and to decide substantial questions relating to the environment – The necessity of having a specialized body, with the expertise to handle multi-dimensional environmental issues allows for an all-encompassing framework for environmental justice – The technical expertise that may be required to address evolving environmental concerns would definitely require a flexible institutional mechanism for its effective exercise. National Green Tribunal: An Authority to take suo motu cognizance of matter – NGT is not required to be triggered into action by an aggrieved or interested party alone – The exercise of power by the NGT is not circumscribed by receipt of application – When substantial questions relating to the environment arise and the issue is civil in nature and those relate to the enactments in Schedule I of the Act, the NGT even in the absence of an application, can self-ignite action either towards amelioration or towards prevention of harm. Environmental law: Precautionary Principle – Application of – Held: The principle must apply in the widest amplitude to ensure that it is not only resorted to for adjudicatory purposes but also for other ‘decisions’ or ‘orders’ to governmental authorities or polluters, when they fail to “to anticipate, prevent and attack the causes of environmental degradation – Two aspects must therefore be emphasized i.e. that the NGT is itself required to carry out preventive and protective measures, as well as hold governmental and private authorities accountable for failing to uphold environmental interests – Thus, a narrow interpretation for NGT’s powers should be eschewed to adopt one which allows for full flow of the forum’s power within the environmental domain – Doctrines/Principles. Environmental law: Environmental justice and equity – When substantive justice is elusive for a large segment, disengaging with substantive rights at the very altar, for a perceived procedural lacuna, would surely bring in a process, which furthers inequality, both economic and social – An “equal footing” conception may not, therefore, be feasible to adequately address the asymmetrical relationship between the polluters and those affected by their actions – Instead, a recognition of the historical experience of marginalized classes of persons while accessing and effectively using the legal system, will allow for necessary appreciation of social realities and balancing the arm of justice.",

National Green Tribunal Act, 2010: Interpretation of – Purposive interpretation – The provision must be read with the intention to accentuate them, especially as they concern protections of rights under Art.21 and also deal with vital environmental policy and its regulatory aspects. National Green Tribunal Act, 2010: Salient features – Discussed. National Green Tribunal Act, 2010: Role of National Green Tribunal – The Schedule I of the NGT Act is concerned with implementation of few environmental related enactments such as the Water Act, the Air Act, the Environment Act, the Forest Conservation Act etc – As one looks at these enactments, an expanded role for the NGT is clearly discernible – The activities of the NGT are not only geared towards the protection of the environment but also to ensure that the developments do not cause serious and irreparable damage to the ecology and the environment – NGT is primarily concerned with protection of the environment and also preservation of the natural resources – As the specialized forum, the NGT would be expected to take preventive action, besides settling and adjudicating disputes and pass orders on all environment related questions – NGT is not just an adjudicatory body but has to perform wider functions in the nature of prevention, remedy and amelioration. National Green Tribunal Act, 2010: Power of National Green Tribunal – In case of environmental events causing damage – The NGT is empowered to carry out restitutive exercise for compensating persons adversely affected by environmental events – The larger discourse which informs such functions is related to distributive and corrective justice – Even in the absence of harm inflicted by human agency, in a situation of a natural calamity, the NGT will be required to devise a plan for alleviating damage – An inquisitorial function is also available for the NGT, within and without adversarial significance – Many of these functions do not require an active “dispute”, but the formulation of decisions. National Green Tribunal: Suo motu power, exercise of – The specialized tribunal’s exercise of suo motu powers is somewhat distinct from those exercised by the constitutional Courts – The Supreme Court and High Courts can foray into any issues under their constitutional mandate but the NGT cannot naturally travel beyond its environmental domain in reference to the scheduled enactments – However, as long as the sphere of action is not breached, the NGT’s powers must be understood to be of the widest amplitude. National Green Tribunal: Uniqueness of NGT vis-a-vis other Tribunals – The statutory Tribunals are categorized to fall under four subheads; Administrative Tribunals under Art.323A; Tribunals under Art.323B; Specialized sector Tribunals and most prominently; Tribunals to safeguard rights under Art.21 – The duties of NGT brings it within the ambit of the fourth category, creating a compelling proposition for wielding much broader powers as delineated by the statute. National Green Tribunal: Sui Generis role of NGT – NGT is a specialised forum – The NGT is a Tribunal with sui generis characteristic, with the special and all-encompassing jurisdiction to protect the environment – Besides its adjudicatory role as an appellate authority, it is also conferred with the responsibility to discharge role of supervisory body and to decide substantial questions relating to the environment – The necessity of having a specialized body, with the expertise to handle multi-dimensional environmental issues allows for an all-encompassing framework for environmental justice – The technical expertise that may be required to address evolving environmental concerns would definitely require a flexible institutional mechanism for its effective exercise. National Green Tribunal: An Authority to take suo motu cognizance of matter – NGT is not required to be triggered into action by an aggrieved or interested party alone – The exercise of power by the NGT is not circumscribed by receipt of application – When substantial questions relating to the environment arise and the issue is civil in nature and those relate to the enactments in Schedule I of the Act, the NGT even in the absence of an application, can self-ignite action either towards amelioration or towards prevention of harm. Environmental law: Precautionary Principle – Application of – Held: The principle must apply in the widest amplitude to ensure that it is not only resorted to for adjudicatory purposes but also for other ‘decisions’ or ‘orders’ to governmental authorities or polluters, when they fail to “to anticipate, prevent and attack the causes of environmental degradation – Two aspects must therefore be emphasized i.e. that the NGT is itself required to carry out preventive and protective measures, as well as hold governmental and private authorities accountable for failing to uphold environmental interests – Thus, a narrow interpretation for NGT’s powers should be eschewed to adopt one which allows for full flow of the forum’s power within the environmental domain – Doctrines/Principles. Environmental law: Environmental justice and equity – When substantive justice is elusive for a large segment, disengaging with substantive rights at the very altar, for a perceived procedural lacuna, would surely bring in a process, which furthers inequality, both economic and social – An “equal footing” conception may not, therefore, be feasible to adequately address the asymmetrical relationship between the polluters and those affected by their actions – Instead, a recognition of the historical experience of marginalized classes of persons while accessing and effectively using the legal system, will allow for necessary appreciation of social realities and balancing the arm of justice.",

        "HeadNote": "National Green Tribunal Act, 2010: History of legislation – Preamble and Statement of Objects and Reasons of the Act – Contours of the jurisdiction of the NGT – Discussed. National Green Tribunal Act, 2010: Interpretation of – Purposive interpretation – The provision must be read with the intention to accentuate them, especially as they concern protections of rights under Art.21 and also deal with vital environmental policy and its regulatory aspects. National Green Tribunal Act, 2010: Salient features – Discussed. National Green Tribunal Act, 2010: Role of National Green Tribunal – The Schedule I of the NGT Act is concerned with implementation of few environmental related enactments such as the Water Act, the Air Act, the Environment Act, the Forest Conservation Act etc – As one looks at these enactments, an expanded role for the NGT is clearly discernible – The activities of the NGT are not only geared towards the protection of the environment but also to ensure that the developments do not cause serious and irreparable damage to the ecology and the environment – NGT is primarily concerned with protection of the environment and also preservation of the natural resources – As the specialized forum, the NGT would be expected to take preventive action, besides settling and adjudicating disputes and pass orders on all environment related questions – NGT is not just an adjudicatory body but has to perform wider functions in the nature of prevention, remedy and amelioration. National Green Tribunal Act, 2010: Power of National Green Tribunal – In case of environmental events causing damage – The NGT is empowered to carry out restitutive exercise for compensating persons adversely affected by environmental events – The larger discourse which informs such functions is related to distributive and corrective justice – Even in the absence of harm inflicted by human agency, in a situation of a natural calamity, the NGT will be required to devise a plan for alleviating damage – An inquisitorial function is also available for the NGT, within and without adversarial significance – Many of these functions do not require an active “dispute”, but the formulation of decisions. National Green Tribunal: Suo motu power, exercise of – The specialized tribunal’s exercise of suo motu powers is somewhat distinct from those exercised by the constitutional Courts – The Supreme Court and High Courts can foray into any issues under their constitutional mandate but the NGT cannot naturally travel beyond its environmental domain in reference to the scheduled enactments – However, as long as the sphere of action is not breached, the NGT’s powers must be understood to be of the widest amplitude. National Green Tribunal: Uniqueness of NGT vis-a-vis other Tribunals – The statutory Tribunals are categorized to fall under four subheads; Administrative Tribunals under Art.323A; Tribunals under Art.323B; Specialized sector Tribunals and most prominently; Tribunals to safeguard rights under Art.21 – The duties of NGT brings it within the ambit of the fourth category, creating a compelling proposition for wielding much broader powers as delineated by the statute. National Green Tribunal: Sui Generis role of NGT – NGT is a specialised forum – The NGT is a Tribunal with sui generis characteristic, with the special and all-encompassing jurisdiction to protect the environment – Besides its adjudicatory role as an appellate authority, it is also conferred with the responsibility to discharge role of supervisory body and to decide substantial questions relating to the environment – The necessity of having a specialized body, with the expertise to handle multi-dimensional environmental issues allows for an all-encompassing framework for environmental justice – The technical expertise that may be required to address evolving environmental concerns would definitely require a flexible institutional mechanism for its effective exercise. National Green Tribunal: An Authority to take suo motu cognizance of matter – NGT is not required to be triggered into action by an aggrieved or interested party alone – The exercise of power by the NGT is not circumscribed by receipt of application – When substantial questions relating to the environment arise and the issue is civil in nature and those relate to the enactments in Schedule I of the Act, the NGT even in the absence of an application, can self-ignite action either towards amelioration or towards prevention of harm. Environmental law: Precautionary Principle – Application of – Held: The principle must apply in the widest amplitude to ensure that it is not only resorted to for adjudicatory purposes but also for other ‘decisions’ or ‘orders’ to governmental authorities or polluters, when they fail to “to anticipate, prevent and attack the causes of environmental degradation – Two aspects must therefore be emphasized i.e. that the NGT is itself required to carry out preventive and protective measures, as well as hold governmental and private authorities accountable for failing to uphold environmental interests – Thus, a narrow interpretation for NGT’s powers should be eschewed to adopt one which allows for full flow of the forum’s power within the environmental domain – Doctrines/Principles. Environmental law: Environmental justice and equity – When substantive justice is elusive for a large segment, disengaging with substantive rights at the very altar, for a perceived procedural lacuna, would surely bring in a process, which furthers inequality, both economic and social – An “equal footing” conception may not, therefore, be feasible to adequately address the asymmetrical relationship between the polluters and those affected by their actions – Instead, a recognition of the historical experience of marginalized classes of persons while accessing and effectively using the legal system, will allow for necessary appreciation of social realities and balancing the arm of justice.",

National Green Tribunal Act, 2010: Interpretation of – Purposive interpretation – The provision must be read with the intention to accentuate them, especially as they concern protections of rights under Art.21 and also deal with vital environmental policy and its regulatory aspects. National Green Tribunal Act, 2010: Salient features – Discussed. National Green Tribunal Act, 2010: Role of National Green Tribunal – The Schedule I of the NGT Act is concerned with implementation of few environmental related enactments such as the Water Act, the Air Act, the Environment Act, the Forest Conservation Act etc – As one looks at these enactments, an expanded role for the NGT is clearly discernible – The activities of the NGT are not only geared towards the protection of the environment but also to ensure that the developments do not cause serious and irreparable damage to the ecology and the environment – NGT is primarily concerned with protection of the environment and also preservation of the natural resources – As the specialized forum, the NGT would be expected to take preventive action, besides settling and adjudicating disputes and pass orders on all environment related questions – NGT is not just an adjudicatory body but has to perform wider functions in the nature of prevention, remedy and amelioration. National Green Tribunal Act, 2010: Power of National Green Tribunal – In case of environmental events causing damage – The NGT is empowered to carry out restitutive exercise for compensating persons adversely affected by environmental events – The larger discourse which informs such functions is related to distributive and corrective justice – Even in the absence of harm inflicted by human agency, in a situation of a natural calamity, the NGT will be required to devise a plan for alleviating damage – An inquisitorial function is also available for the NGT, within and without adversarial significance – Many of these functions do not require an active “dispute”, but the formulation of decisions. National Green Tribunal: Suo motu power, exercise of – The specialized tribunal’s exercise of suo motu powers is somewhat distinct from those exercised by the constitutional Courts – The Supreme Court and High Courts can foray into any issues under their constitutional mandate but the NGT cannot naturally travel beyond its environmental domain in reference to the scheduled enactments – However, as long as the sphere of action is not breached, the NGT’s powers must be understood to be of the widest amplitude. National Green Tribunal: Uniqueness of NGT vis-a-vis other Tribunals – The statutory Tribunals are categorized to fall under four subheads; Administrative Tribunals under Art.323A; Tribunals under Art.323B; Specialized sector Tribunals and most prominently; Tribunals to safeguard rights under Art.21 – The duties of NGT brings it within the ambit of the fourth category, creating a compelling proposition for wielding much broader powers as delineated by the statute. National Green Tribunal: Sui Generis role of NGT – NGT is a specialised forum – The NGT is a Tribunal with sui generis characteristic, with the special and all-encompassing jurisdiction to protect the environment – Besides its adjudicatory role as an appellate authority, it is also conferred with the responsibility to discharge role of supervisory body and to decide substantial questions relating to the environment – The necessity of having a specialized body, with the expertise to handle multi-dimensional environmental issues allows for an all-encompassing framework for environmental justice – The technical expertise that may be required to address evolving environmental concerns would definitely require a flexible institutional mechanism for its effective exercise. National Green Tribunal: An Authority to take suo motu cognizance of matter – NGT is not required to be triggered into action by an aggrieved or interested party alone – The exercise of power by the NGT is not circumscribed by receipt of application – When substantial questions relating to the environment arise and the issue is civil in nature and those relate to the enactments in Schedule I of the Act, the NGT even in the absence of an application, can self-ignite action either towards amelioration or towards prevention of harm. Environmental law: Precautionary Principle – Application of – Held: The principle must apply in the widest amplitude to ensure that it is not only resorted to for adjudicatory purposes but also for other ‘decisions’ or ‘orders’ to governmental authorities or polluters, when they fail to “to anticipate, prevent and attack the causes of environmental degradation – Two aspects must therefore be emphasized i.e. that the NGT is itself required to carry out preventive and protective measures, as well as hold governmental and private authorities accountable for failing to uphold environmental interests – Thus, a narrow interpretation for NGT’s powers should be eschewed to adopt one which allows for full flow of the forum’s power within the environmental domain – Doctrines/Principles. Environmental law: Environmental justice and equity – When substantive justice is elusive for a large segment, disengaging with substantive rights at the very altar, for a perceived procedural lacuna, would surely bring in a process, which furthers inequality, both economic and social – An “equal footing” conception may not, therefore, be feasible to adequately address the asymmetrical relationship between the polluters and those affected by their actions – Instead, a recognition of the historical experience of marginalized classes of persons while accessing and effectively using the legal system, will allow for necessary appreciation of social realities and balancing the arm of justice.",

National Green Tribunal Act, 2010: Interpretation of – Purposive interpretation – The provision must be read with the intention to accentuate them, especially as they concern protections of rights under Art.21 and also deal with vital environmental policy and its regulatory aspects. National Green Tribunal Act, 2010: Salient features – Discussed. National Green Tribunal Act, 2010: Role of National Green Tribunal – The Schedule I of the NGT Act is concerned with implementation of few environmental related enactments such as the Water Act, the Air Act, the Environment Act, the Forest Conservation Act etc – As one looks at these enactments, an expanded role for the NGT is clearly discernible – The activities of the NGT are not only geared towards the protection of the environment but also to ensure that the developments do not cause serious and irreparable damage to the ecology and the environment – NGT is primarily concerned with protection of the environment and also preservation of the natural resources – As the specialized forum, the NGT would be expected to take preventive action, besides settling and adjudicating disputes and pass orders on all environment related questions – NGT is not just an adjudicatory body but has to perform wider functions in the nature of prevention, remedy and amelioration. National Green Tribunal Act, 2010: Power of National Green Tribunal – In case of environmental events causing damage – The NGT is empowered to carry out restitutive exercise for compensating persons adversely affected by environmental events – The larger discourse which informs such functions is related to distributive and corrective justice – Even in the absence of harm inflicted by human agency, in a situation of a natural calamity, the NGT will be required to devise a plan for alleviating damage – An inquisitorial function is also available for the NGT, within and without adversarial significance – Many of these functions do not require an active “dispute”, but the formulation of decisions. National Green Tribunal: Suo motu power, exercise of – The specialized tribunal’s exercise of suo motu powers is somewhat distinct from those exercised by the constitutional Courts – The Supreme Court and High Courts can foray into any issues under their constitutional mandate but the NGT cannot naturally travel beyond its environmental domain in reference to the scheduled enactments – However, as long as the sphere of action is not breached, the NGT’s powers must be understood to be of the widest amplitude. National Green Tribunal: Uniqueness of NGT vis-a-vis other Tribunals – The statutory Tribunals are categorized to fall under four subheads; Administrative Tribunals under Art.323A; Tribunals under Art.323B; Specialized sector Tribunals and most prominently; Tribunals to safeguard rights under Art.21 – The duties of NGT brings it within the ambit of the fourth category, creating a compelling proposition for wielding much broader powers as delineated by the statute. National Green Tribunal: Sui Generis role of NGT – NGT is a specialised forum – The NGT is a Tribunal with sui generis characteristic, with the special and all-encompassing jurisdiction to protect the environment – Besides its adjudicatory role as an appellate authority, it is also conferred with the responsibility to discharge role of supervisory body and to decide substantial questions relating to the environment – The necessity of having a specialized body, with the expertise to handle multi-dimensional environmental issues allows for an all-encompassing framework for environmental justice – The technical expertise that may be required to address evolving environmental concerns would definitely require a flexible institutional mechanism for its effective exercise. National Green Tribunal: An Authority to take suo motu cognizance of matter – NGT is not required to be triggered into action by an aggrieved or interested party alone – The exercise of power by the NGT is not circumscribed by receipt of application – When substantial questions relating to the environment arise and the issue is civil in nature and those relate to the enactments in Schedule I of the Act, the NGT even in the absence of an application, can self-ignite action either towards amelioration or towards prevention of harm. Environmental law: Precautionary Principle – Application of – Held: The principle must apply in the widest amplitude to ensure that it is not only resorted to for adjudicatory purposes but also for other ‘decisions’ or ‘orders’ to governmental authorities or polluters, when they fail to “to anticipate, prevent and attack the causes of environmental degradation – Two aspects must therefore be emphasized i.e. that the NGT is itself required to carry out preventive and protective measures, as well as hold governmental and private authorities accountable for failing to uphold environmental interests – Thus, a narrow interpretation for NGT’s powers should be eschewed to adopt one which allows for full flow of the forum’s power within the environmental domain – Doctrines/Principles. Environmental law: Environmental justice and equity – When substantive justice is elusive for a large segment, disengaging with substantive rights at the very altar, for a perceived procedural lacuna, would surely bring in a process, which furthers inequality, both economic and social – An “equal footing” conception may not, therefore, be feasible to adequately address the asymmetrical relationship between the polluters and those affected by their actions – Instead, a recognition of the historical experience of marginalized classes of persons while accessing and effectively using the legal system, will allow for necessary appreciation of social realities and balancing the arm of justice.",

Constitution of India: Art. 32 – Writ petition under – Disinvestment of the residual 29.54 per cent shareholding of the Union Government challenged on the ground that the residual disinvestment can occur only after the amendment of the Nationalisation Act 1976 – Said prayer substantially similar to the reliefs sought in Maton Mines Mazdoor Sangh’s case, wherein they challenged the disinvestment of 2002 and 2014, on the basis of the decision in Centre for Public Interest Litigation – Petition, if barred by the principles of res judicata, following the dismissal of the earlier writ petition on the same issue – Held: The summary dismissal of an earlier petition u/Art. 32 does not bar the instant writ petition on grounds of res judicata as there has been no substantive decision on the merits of the issues, thus, the instant writ petition not barred by res judicata – Metal Corporation (Nationalisation and Miscellaneous) Provisions Act 1976. Code of Civil Procedure 1908: s. 11 – Principle of res judicata – Determination of its applicability - Held: While determining the applicability of the principle of res judicata u/s. 11, the grave issues of public interest are not to be ignored merely because a petition was initially filed and dismissed, without a substantial adjudication on merits – There is a trend of poorly pleaded public interest litigations being filed instantly following a disclosure in the media, with a conscious intention to obtain a dismissal from the Court and preclude genuine litigants from approaching the Court in public interest – Court to be aware of the contemporary reality and interpret the principles of res judicata or constructive res judicata in a manner which does not debar access to justice – Jurisdiction u/Art. 32 is a fundamental right in and of itself. H Investigation: CBI Crime Manual – Process of conducting CBI’s preliminary enquiries – Preliminary enquiry by CBI into the suspected irregularities in the course of disinvestment of 26% equity holding of the Union Government to SOVL company in 2002 – Submission of status report by CBI – Held: There is no bar on the constitutional power of this Court to direct the CBI to register a regular case, in spite of its decision to close a preliminary enquiry – On facts, a prima facie case for a cognizable offence, as mandated in para 9.1 of the CBI Manual, made out – Sufficient material for registration of a regular case in relation to the 26 per cent disinvestment of HZL by the Union Government in 2002 – Thus, registration of a regular case, followed by a full-fledged investigation must be conducted – Issuance of direction to CBI to register a regular case and periodically submit status reports of its investigation to this Court – Constitution of India – Art. 32.",

        "HeadNote": "Disinvestment: Policy of disinvestment – Union Government’s divestment of its residual shareholding of 29.54 % in HZL company – Public interest litigation u/Art. 32, seeking mandamus directing the Union Government to refrain from disinvestment without amending the Nationalisation Act, 1976 – Held: Decision in Centre for Public Interest Litigation’s case, does not apply to the present facts because HZL had ceased to be a government company, at the stage of the disinvestment – Thus, the Union Government’s decision to disinvest 29.54 per cent of its residual shareholding in HZL is not interdicted by the principles laid down by this Court in Centre for Public Interest Litigation’s case that when the acquisition takes place under an Act of Parliament, any disinvestment by the Union Government can be undertaken only with the approval of Parliament or through its intervention –There is no challenge to the disinvestment which took place in 1991-92 or in 2002, the latter having resulted in HZL ceasing to retain its status as a government company within the meaning of s. 617 of the Companies Act 1956 – It would be inconsistent to read an implied limitation on the transfer by the Union Government of its residual shareholding in HZL representing 29.54 per cent of the equity capital – Thus, when a decision is taken by the government as shareholder of a company to sell its shares, it acts as any other shareholder in a company who makes the decision on the basis of the financial and economic exigencies – Furthermore, SOVL company does not seek to exercise the second call option, in terms of the Share Purchase Agreement, as such the Union Government took decision to sell its residuary shareholding in the open market – Union Government being amenable to Part III of the Constitution, would not impose a restraint on its capacity to decide, as a shareholder, to disinvest its shareholding, the process of disinvestment being transparent and which comports with law and results in the best price being a shareholding – Metal Corporation (Nationalisation and Miscellaneous) Provisions Act 1976 – Constitution of India – Art. 32.  Constitution of India: Art. 32 – Writ petition under – Disinvestment of the residual 29.54 per cent shareholding of the Union Government challenged on the ground that the residual disinvestment can occur only after the amendment of the Nationalisation Act 1976 – Said prayer substantially similar to the reliefs sought in Maton Mines Mazdoor Sangh’s case, wherein they challenged the disinvestment of 2002 and 2014, on the basis of the decision in Centre for Public Interest Litigation – Petition, if barred by the principles of res judicata, following the dismissal of the earlier writ petition on the same issue – Held: The summary dismissal of an earlier petition u/Art. 32 does not bar the instant writ petition on grounds of res judicata as there has been no substantive decision on the merits of the issues, thus, the instant writ petition not barred by res judicata – Metal Corporation (Nationalisation and Miscellaneous) Provisions Act 1976. Code of Civil Procedure 1908: s. 11 – Principle of res judicata – Determination of its applicability - Held: While determining the applicability of the principle of res judicata u/s. 11, the grave issues of public interest are not to be ignored merely because a petition was initially filed and dismissed, without a substantial adjudication on merits – There is a trend of poorly pleaded public interest litigations being filed instantly following a disclosure in the media, with a conscious intention to obtain a dismissal from the Court and preclude genuine litigants from approaching the Court in public interest – Court to be aware of the contemporary reality and interpret the principles of res judicata or constructive res judicata in a manner which does not debar access to justice – Jurisdiction u/Art. 32 is a fundamental right in and of itself. H Investigation: CBI Crime Manual – Process of conducting CBI’s preliminary enquiries – Preliminary enquiry by CBI into the suspected irregularities in the course of disinvestment of 26% equity holding of the Union Government to SOVL company in 2002 – Submission of status report by CBI – Held: There is no bar on the constitutional power of this Court to direct the CBI to register a regular case, in spite of its decision to close a preliminary enquiry – On facts, a prima facie case for a cognizable offence, as mandated in para 9.1 of the CBI Manual, made out – Sufficient material for registration of a regular case in relation to the 26 per cent disinvestment of HZL by the Union Government in 2002 – Thus, registration of a regular case, followed by a full-fledged investigation must be conducted – Issuance of direction to CBI to register a regular case and periodically submit status reports of its investigation to this Court – Constitution of India – Art. 32.",

        "HeadNote": "Disinvestment: Policy of disinvestment – Union Government’s divestment of its residual shareholding of 29.54 % in HZL company – Public interest litigation u/Art. 32, seeking mandamus directing the Union Government to refrain from disinvestment without amending the Nationalisation Act, 1976 – Held: Decision in Centre for Public Interest Litigation’s case, does not apply to the present facts because HZL had ceased to be a government company, at the stage of the disinvestment – Thus, the Union Government’s decision to disinvest 29.54 per cent of its residual shareholding in HZL is not interdicted by the principles laid down by this Court in Centre for Public Interest Litigation’s case that when the acquisition takes place under an Act of Parliament, any disinvestment by the Union Government can be undertaken only with the approval of Parliament or through its intervention –There is no challenge to the disinvestment which took place in 1991-92 or in 2002, the latter having resulted in HZL ceasing to retain its status as a government company within the meaning of s. 617 of the Companies Act 1956 – It would be inconsistent to read an implied limitation on the transfer by the Union Government of its residual shareholding in HZL representing 29.54 per cent of the equity capital – Thus, when a decision is taken by the government as shareholder of a company to sell its shares, it acts as any other shareholder in a company who makes the decision on the basis of the financial and economic exigencies – Furthermore, SOVL company does not seek to exercise the second call option, in terms of the Share Purchase Agreement, as such the Union Government took decision to sell its residuary shareholding in the open market – Union Government being amenable to Part III of the Constitution, would not impose a restraint on its capacity to decide, as a shareholder, to disinvest its shareholding, the process of disinvestment being transparent and which comports with law and results in the best price being a shareholding – Metal Corporation (Nationalisation and Miscellaneous) Provisions Act 1976 – Constitution of India – Art. 32.  Constitution of India: Art. 32 – Writ petition under – Disinvestment of the residual 29.54 per cent shareholding of the Union Government challenged on the ground that the residual disinvestment can occur only after the amendment of the Nationalisation Act 1976 – Said prayer substantially similar to the reliefs sought in Maton Mines Mazdoor Sangh’s case, wherein they challenged the disinvestment of 2002 and 2014, on the basis of the decision in Centre for Public Interest Litigation – Petition, if barred by the principles of res judicata, following the dismissal of the earlier writ petition on the same issue – Held: The summary dismissal of an earlier petition u/Art. 32 does not bar the instant writ petition on grounds of res judicata as there has been no substantive decision on the merits of the issues, thus, the instant writ petition not barred by res judicata – Metal Corporation (Nationalisation and Miscellaneous) Provisions Act 1976. Code of Civil Procedure 1908: s. 11 – Principle of res judicata – Determination of its applicability - Held: While determining the applicability of the principle of res judicata u/s. 11, the grave issues of public interest are not to be ignored merely because a petition was initially filed and dismissed, without a substantial adjudication on merits – There is a trend of poorly pleaded public interest litigations being filed instantly following a disclosure in the media, with a conscious intention to obtain a dismissal from the Court and preclude genuine litigants from approaching the Court in public interest – Court to be aware of the contemporary reality and interpret the principles of res judicata or constructive res judicata in a manner which does not debar access to justice – Jurisdiction u/Art. 32 is a fundamental right in and of itself. H Investigation: CBI Crime Manual – Process of conducting CBI’s preliminary enquiries – Preliminary enquiry by CBI into the suspected irregularities in the course of disinvestment of 26% equity holding of the Union Government to SOVL company in 2002 – Submission of status report by CBI – Held: There is no bar on the constitutional power of this Court to direct the CBI to register a regular case, in spite of its decision to close a preliminary enquiry – On facts, a prima facie case for a cognizable offence, as mandated in para 9.1 of the CBI Manual, made out – Sufficient material for registration of a regular case in relation to the 26 per cent disinvestment of HZL by the Union Government in 2002 – Thus, registration of a regular case, followed by a full-fledged investigation must be conducted – Issuance of direction to CBI to register a regular case and periodically submit status reports of its investigation to this Court – Constitution of India – Art. 32.",

        "HeadNote": "Disinvestment: Policy of disinvestment – Union Government’s divestment of its residual shareholding of 29.54 % in HZL company – Public interest litigation u/Art. 32, seeking mandamus directing the Union Government to refrain from disinvestment without amending the Nationalisation Act, 1976 – Held: Decision in Centre for Public Interest Litigation’s case, does not apply to the present facts because HZL had ceased to be a government company, at the stage of the disinvestment – Thus, the Union Government’s decision to disinvest 29.54 per cent of its residual shareholding in HZL is not interdicted by the principles laid down by this Court in Centre for Public Interest Litigation’s case that when the acquisition takes place under an Act of Parliament, any disinvestment by the Union Government can be undertaken only with the approval of Parliament or through its intervention –There is no challenge to the disinvestment which took place in 1991-92 or in 2002, the latter having resulted in HZL ceasing to retain its status as a government company within the meaning of s. 617 of the Companies Act 1956 – It would be inconsistent to read an implied limitation on the transfer by the Union Government of its residual shareholding in HZL representing 29.54 per cent of the equity capital – Thus, when a decision is taken by the government as shareholder of a company to sell its shares, it acts as any other shareholder in a company who makes the decision on the basis of the financial and economic exigencies – Furthermore, SOVL company does not seek to exercise the second call option, in terms of the Share Purchase Agreement, as such the Union Government took decision to sell its residuary shareholding in the open market – Union Government being amenable to Part III of the Constitution, would not impose a restraint on its capacity to decide, as a shareholder, to disinvest its shareholding, the process of disinvestment being transparent and which comports with law and results in the best price being a shareholding – Metal Corporation (Nationalisation and Miscellaneous) Provisions Act 1976 – Constitution of India – Art. 32.  Constitution of India: Art. 32 – Writ petition under – Disinvestment of the residual 29.54 per cent shareholding of the Union Government challenged on the ground that the residual disinvestment can occur only after the amendment of the Nationalisation Act 1976 – Said prayer substantially similar to the reliefs sought in Maton Mines Mazdoor Sangh’s case, wherein they challenged the disinvestment of 2002 and 2014, on the basis of the decision in Centre for Public Interest Litigation – Petition, if barred by the principles of res judicata, following the dismissal of the earlier writ petition on the same issue – Held: The summary dismissal of an earlier petition u/Art. 32 does not bar the instant writ petition on grounds of res judicata as there has been no substantive decision on the merits of the issues, thus, the instant writ petition not barred by res judicata – Metal Corporation (Nationalisation and Miscellaneous) Provisions Act 1976. Code of Civil Procedure 1908: s. 11 – Principle of res judicata – Determination of its applicability - Held: While determining the applicability of the principle of res judicata u/s. 11, the grave issues of public interest are not to be ignored merely because a petition was initially filed and dismissed, without a substantial adjudication on merits – There is a trend of poorly pleaded public interest litigations being filed instantly following a disclosure in the media, with a conscious intention to obtain a dismissal from the Court and preclude genuine litigants from approaching the Court in public interest – Court to be aware of the contemporary reality and interpret the principles of res judicata or constructive res judicata in a manner which does not debar access to justice – Jurisdiction u/Art. 32 is a fundamental right in and of itself. H Investigation: CBI Crime Manual – Process of conducting CBI’s preliminary enquiries – Preliminary enquiry by CBI into the suspected irregularities in the course of disinvestment of 26% equity holding of the Union Government to SOVL company in 2002 – Submission of status report by CBI – Held: There is no bar on the constitutional power of this Court to direct the CBI to register a regular case, in spite of its decision to close a preliminary enquiry – On facts, a prima facie case for a cognizable offence, as mandated in para 9.1 of the CBI Manual, made out – Sufficient material for registration of a regular case in relation to the 26 per cent disinvestment of HZL by the Union Government in 2002 – Thus, registration of a regular case, followed by a full-fledged investigation must be conducted – Issuance of direction to CBI to register a regular case and periodically submit status reports of its investigation to this Court – Constitution of India – Art. 32.",

Constitution of India: Art. 32 – Writ petition under – Disinvestment of the residual 29.54 per cent shareholding of the Union Government challenged on the ground that the residual disinvestment can occur only after the amendment of the Nationalisation Act 1976 – Said prayer substantially similar to the reliefs sought in Maton Mines Mazdoor Sangh’s case, wherein they challenged the disinvestment of 2002 and 2014, on the basis of the decision in Centre for Public Interest Litigation – Petition, if barred by the principles of res judicata, following the dismissal of the earlier writ petition on the same issue – Held: The summary dismissal of an earlier petition u/Art. 32 does not bar the instant writ petition on grounds of res judicata as there has been no substantive decision on the merits of the issues, thus, the instant writ petition not barred by res judicata – Metal Corporation (Nationalisation and Miscellaneous) Provisions Act 1976. Code of Civil Procedure 1908: s. 11 – Principle of res judicata – Determination of its applicability - Held: While determining the applicability of the principle of res judicata u/s. 11, the grave issues of public interest are not to be ignored merely because a petition was initially filed and dismissed, without a substantial adjudication on merits – There is a trend of poorly pleaded public interest litigations being filed instantly following a disclosure in the media, with a conscious intention to obtain a dismissal from the Court and preclude genuine litigants from approaching the Court in public interest – Court to be aware of the contemporary reality and interpret the principles of res judicata or constructive res judicata in a manner which does not debar access to justice – Jurisdiction u/Art. 32 is a fundamental right in and of itself. H Investigation: CBI Crime Manual – Process of conducting CBI’s preliminary enquiries – Preliminary enquiry by CBI into the suspected irregularities in the course of disinvestment of 26% equity holding of the Union Government to SOVL company in 2002 – Submission of status report by CBI – Held: There is no bar on the constitutional power of this Court to direct the CBI to register a regular case, in spite of its decision to close a preliminary enquiry – On facts, a prima facie case for a cognizable offence, as mandated in para 9.1 of the CBI Manual, made out – Sufficient material for registration of a regular case in relation to the 26 per cent disinvestment of HZL by the Union Government in 2002 – Thus, registration of a regular case, followed by a full-fledged investigation must be conducted – Issuance of direction to CBI to register a regular case and periodically submit status reports of its investigation to this Court – Constitution of India – Art. 32.",

        "HeadNote": "Central Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017 – ss. 16, 39, 49, 59 and 168 – Central Goods and Services Tax Rules, 2017 – Circular dated 29.12.2017 issued by the Commissioner (GST) – Validity of – Act of 2017 and Rules of 2017 brought into force along with Forms GSTR-1, GSTR-2, GSTR-2A, GSTR-3 and GSTR-3B – Various notifications were issued – In exercise of the powers conferred by Rule 61(5) of the stated Rules, the Central Government issued Notification No.21/2017-Central Tax specifying that the return for the months of July and August 2017 to be furnished in Form GSTR-3B electronically through the common portal before the dates as specified in the corresponding entry in column (3) of the table given therein – Thereafter again various notifications/circulars were regarding extension of time (notification dated 17.08.2017), relating to system-based reconciliation of information furnished in Forms GSTR-1, GSTR-2 and GSTR-3B and the mechanism for correction of erroneous details furnished in Form GSTR-3B, specifying the timeline for filing of return in Form GSTR-3B (circular dated 01.09.2017) etc. were issued – The Commissioner (GST) then issued the circular dated 29.12.2017, on the subject of filing of returns under GST, clarifying certain issues considered by the Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs to usher in uniformity in implementation across field formations – By this Circular, the earlier Circular issued on 01.09.2017 was kept in abeyance – Paragraph 4 of the Circular dated 29.12.2017 specifies “...It may be noted that while making adjustment in the output tax liability or input tax credit, there can be no negative entries in the FORM GSTR-3B – The amount remaining for adjustment, if any, may be adjusted in the return(s) in FORM GSTR-3B of subsequent month(s) and, in cases where such adjustment is not feasible, refund may be claimed...” – Respondent No. 1 was, however, keen on availing of the dispensation specified in the Circular dated 01.09.2017 for the relevant period (July to September 2017) – After Form GSTR-2A became operational in September 2018, respondent No. 1 realized that it had sufficient amount in the ITC ledger account (electronic credit ledger) during the relevant period – Further, due to non- functionality of GSTR-2A, respondent No. 1 had to discharge its OTL by depositing/paying in cash – Respondent No.1 urged to rectify Form GSTR-3B – However, the impugned Circular dated 29.12.2017 came in the way of respondent No. 1 in doing so – Resultantly, respondent No.1 approached the High Court by way of writ petition – High Court allowed the writ petition and read down paragraph 4 of circular dated 29.12.2017 to the extent it restricted the rectification of Form GSTR-3B in respect of period in which the error had occurred – Before the Supreme Court respondent no. 1 contended that the circular dated 29.12.2017 was issued without any authority of law – Held: The decision was taken by the Board after considering various representations received seeking clarifications on various aspects of return filing such as return filing dates, applicability of quantum of late fee, amendment of errors in submitting/filing of Form GSTR-3B and other related queries – In strict sense, it is not the direction issued by the Commissioner (GST) as such, but it is notifying the decision(s) of the Board taken in exercise of its powers conferred u/s. 168(1) of the 2017 Act – The circular was issued under the signatures of Commissioner (GST), but in essence, it was notifying the decision(s) of the Board, which has authority and power to issue directions – The stipulations in the stated circular including paragraph 4 are consistent with the provisions of the 2017 Act and the Rules – The express provision in the form of s. 39(9) clearly posits that omission or incorrect particulars furnished in the return in Form GSTR-3B can be corrected in the return to be furnished in the month or quarter during which such omission or incorrect particulars are noticed – Accordingly, the argument that the impugned Circular dated 29.12.2017 was issued without authority of law is rejected. Central Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017 – ss. 16, 39, 49 and 59 – Central Goods and Services Tax Rules, 2017 – rr. 59, 60 and 61 – Rectification of Form GSTR-3B – The grievance of the writ petitioner-respondent no.1 before the High Court was that due to non-operability of Form GSTR-2A at the relevant time (July to September 2017), it was denied of access to the information about its electronic credit ledger account and consequently, availing of Input Tax Credit (ITC) for the relevant period and instead to discharge the Output Tax Liability (OTL) by paying cash to its vendors – Thus, it has resulted in payment of double tax and unfair advantage to the tax authorities because of their failure to operationalize the statutory forms enabling auto-populating statement of inward supplies of the recipient and outward supplies including facility of matching and correcting the discrepancies electronically – The High Court allowed the writ petition for the period to which the ‘error relates’ i.e. July to September 2017 – High Court also allowed writ petitioner to rectify Form GSTR-3B for the period in which error had occurred – On appeal, held: The writ petitioner being a registered person, was under a legal obligation to maintain books of accounts and records as per the provisions of the 2017 Act and Chapter VII of the 2017 Rules regarding the transactions in respect of which the OTL would occur – Even in the past (till recently upto the 2017 Act came into force), during the pre-GST regime, the writ petitioner (being registered person/assessee) had been maintaining such books of accounts and records and submitting returns on its own – No such auto-populated electronic data was in vogue – It is the same pattern which had to be followed by the registered person in the post-GST regime – Further, as per scheme of the 2017 Act, registered person is obliged to do self-assessment of ITC, reckon its eligibility to ITC and of OTL including the balance amount lying in cash or credit ledger primarily on the basis of his office record and books of accounts required to be statutorily preserved – That he could do without the common electronic portal as was being done in the past till recently pre-GST regime – The factum of non-operability of Form GSTR-2A, therefore, is a flimsy plea taken by the writ petitioner – The writ petitioner with full knowledge and information had done self- assessment and assessed the OTL for the relevant period and chose to discharge the same by paying cash – Having so opted, now it was not open to the respondent to resile from option already exercised – As far as rectification of errors is concerned, the matching and correction process happens on its own as per mechanism specified in ss.37 and 38, after which Form GSTR-3 is generated for the submission of returns; and once submitted any changes may have a cascading effect – Therefore, law permits rectification of error and omissions only at the initial stages of Form GSTR-1 and GSTR-3, but in a specified manner – The direction of the High Court to allow the rectification cannot be sustained – The impugned judgment and order of the High Court is set aside.",

B s. 149 – Unlawful assembly – Common object of an assembly – Held: Common object is different from common intention as it does not require a prior concert and a common meeting of minds before the attack – It is enough if each has the same object in view and their number is five or more and that they act as an assembly to achieve that object – Common object of an assembly is to be ascertained from the acts and language of the members composing it, from the surrounding circumstances and the course of conduct adopted by the members. Witnesses: Hostile witness – Evidentiary value – Held: Part of the evidence of the hostile witness which is creditworthy, can be acted upon – Criminal trial. F Protection of – Implementation of Witness Protection Scheme – Need to formulate scheme/guidelines/programmes to safeguard rights of the witnesses.

Honour killings: Preventive steps, remedial and punitive measures to combat honour crimes – Suggestion of, in Shakti Vahini’s case – Stated. Casteism: Commission of atrocities in the name of castes – Ghastly murders of three youngsters, by physically assaulting them for nearly 12 hours for violating caste-ridden societal norms – Held: Episodes of honour killing demonstrate that the casteism has not been annihilated even after 75 years of independence – Bigotry perpetuated by such caste-based practices impedes the objective of the Constitution of equality for all its citizens – High time for the civil society to react and respond with strong disapproval about the ghastly crimes committed in the name of caste.

B s. 149 – Unlawful assembly – Common object of an assembly – Held: Common object is different from common intention as it does not require a prior concert and a common meeting of minds before the attack – It is enough if each has the same object in view and their number is five or more and that they act as an assembly to achieve that object – Common object of an assembly is to be ascertained from the acts and language of the members composing it, from the surrounding circumstances and the course of conduct adopted by the members. Witnesses: Hostile witness – Evidentiary value – Held: Part of the evidence of the hostile witness which is creditworthy, can be acted upon – Criminal trial. F Protection of – Implementation of Witness Protection Scheme – Need to formulate scheme/guidelines/programmes to safeguard rights of the witnesses. Constitution of India: Art. 136 – Interference by this Court in a criminal appeal by a Special Leave – Governing principles – Stated. Art. 19(1)(a) and Art. 21 – Right to life – Right to life guaranteed to the people also includes in its fold the right to live in a society which is free from crime and fear, and the right of witnesses to testify in courts in free and fair manner without fear or pressure – If one is unable to testify in courts due to threats or other pressures, it is a clear violation of Art. 19(1)(a) and Art. 21 – One of the main reasons for witnesses to turn hostile is that they are not accorded appropriate protection by the State – State to ensure the safety of the witnesses irrespective of case, creed, religion, such that they could safely depose the truth in the court at least in sensitive cases involving those in power, political patronage. Honour killings: Preventive steps, remedial and punitive measures to combat honour crimes – Suggestion of, in Shakti Vahini’s case – Stated. Casteism: Commission of atrocities in the name of castes – Ghastly murders of three youngsters, by physically assaulting them for nearly 12 hours for violating caste-ridden societal norms – Held: Episodes of honour killing demonstrate that the casteism has not been annihilated even after 75 years of independence – Bigotry perpetuated by such caste-based practices impedes the objective of the Constitution of equality for all its citizens – High time for the civil society to react and respond with strong disapproval about the ghastly crimes committed in the name of caste. Administration of justice: Administration of criminal justice – Racial and religiously motivated crimes, if to be treated as aggravating factors for enhanced punishment – Foreign laws-United Kingdom, Canada, United States vis-a-vis Indian laws – Discussed.",

B s. 149 – Unlawful assembly – Common object of an assembly – Held: Common object is different from common intention as it does not require a prior concert and a common meeting of minds before the attack – It is enough if each has the same object in view and their number is five or more and that they act as an assembly to achieve that object – Common object of an assembly is to be ascertained from the acts and language of the members composing it, from the surrounding circumstances and the course of conduct adopted by the members. Witnesses: Hostile witness – Evidentiary value – Held: Part of the evidence of the hostile witness which is creditworthy, can be acted upon – Criminal trial. F Protection of – Implementation of Witness Protection Scheme – Need to formulate scheme/guidelines/programmes to safeguard rights of the witnesses. Constitution of India: Art. 136 – Interference by this Court in a criminal appeal by a Special Leave – Governing principles – Stated. Art. 19(1)(a) and Art. 21 – Right to life – Right to life guaranteed to the people also includes in its fold the right to live in a society which is free from crime and fear, and the right of witnesses to testify in courts in free and fair manner without fear or pressure – If one is unable to testify in courts due to threats or other pressures, it is a clear violation of Art. 19(1)(a) and Art. 21 – One of the main reasons for witnesses to turn hostile is that they are not accorded appropriate protection by the State – State to ensure the safety of the witnesses irrespective of case, creed, religion, such that they could safely depose the truth in the court at least in sensitive cases involving those in power, political patronage. Honour killings: Preventive steps, remedial and punitive measures to combat honour crimes – Suggestion of, in Shakti Vahini’s case – Stated. Casteism: Commission of atrocities in the name of castes – Ghastly murders of three youngsters, by physically assaulting them for nearly 12 hours for violating caste-ridden societal norms – Held: Episodes of honour killing demonstrate that the casteism has not been annihilated even after 75 years of independence – Bigotry perpetuated by such caste-based practices impedes the objective of the Constitution of equality for all its citizens – High time for the civil society to react and respond with strong disapproval about the ghastly crimes committed in the name of caste. Administration of justice: Administration of criminal justice – Racial and religiously motivated crimes, if to be treated as aggravating factors for enhanced punishment – Foreign laws-United Kingdom, Canada, United States vis-a-vis Indian laws – Discussed.",

B s. 149 – Unlawful assembly – Common object of an assembly – Held: Common object is different from common intention as it does not require a prior concert and a common meeting of minds before the attack – It is enough if each has the same object in view and their number is five or more and that they act as an assembly to achieve that object – Common object of an assembly is to be ascertained from the acts and language of the members composing it, from the surrounding circumstances and the course of conduct adopted by the members. Witnesses: Hostile witness – Evidentiary value – Held: Part of the evidence of the hostile witness which is creditworthy, can be acted upon – Criminal trial. F Protection of – Implementation of Witness Protection Scheme – Need to formulate scheme/guidelines/programmes to safeguard rights of the witnesses. Constitution of India: Art. 136 – Interference by this Court in a criminal appeal by a Special Leave – Governing principles – Stated. Art. 19(1)(a) and Art. 21 – Right to life – Right to life guaranteed to the people also includes in its fold the right to live in a society which is free from crime and fear, and the right of witnesses to testify in courts in free and fair manner without fear or pressure – If one is unable to testify in courts due to threats or other pressures, it is a clear violation of Art. 19(1)(a) and Art. 21 – One of the main reasons for witnesses to turn hostile is that they are not accorded appropriate protection by the State – State to ensure the safety of the witnesses irrespective of case, creed, religion, such that they could safely depose the truth in the court at least in sensitive cases involving those in power, political patronage. Honour killings: Preventive steps, remedial and punitive measures to combat honour crimes – Suggestion of, in Shakti Vahini’s case – Stated. Casteism: Commission of atrocities in the name of castes – Ghastly murders of three youngsters, by physically assaulting them for nearly 12 hours for violating caste-ridden societal norms – Held: Episodes of honour killing demonstrate that the casteism has not been annihilated even after 75 years of independence – Bigotry perpetuated by such caste-based practices impedes the objective of the Constitution of equality for all its citizens – High time for the civil society to react and respond with strong disapproval about the ghastly crimes committed in the name of caste. Administration of justice: Administration of criminal justice – Racial and religiously motivated crimes, if to be treated as aggravating factors for enhanced punishment – Foreign laws-United Kingdom, Canada, United States vis-a-vis Indian laws – Discussed.",

B s. 149 – Unlawful assembly – Common object of an assembly – Held: Common object is different from common intention as it does not require a prior concert and a common meeting of minds before the attack – It is enough if each has the same object in view and their number is five or more and that they act as an assembly to achieve that object – Common object of an assembly is to be ascertained from the acts and language of the members composing it, from the surrounding circumstances and the course of conduct adopted by the members. Witnesses: Hostile witness – Evidentiary value – Held: Part of the evidence of the hostile witness which is creditworthy, can be acted upon – Criminal trial. F Protection of – Implementation of Witness Protection Scheme – Need to formulate scheme/guidelines/programmes to safeguard rights of the witnesses. Constitution of India: Art. 136 – Interference by this Court in a criminal appeal by a Special Leave – Governing principles – Stated. Art. 19(1)(a) and Art. 21 – Right to life – Right to life guaranteed to the people also includes in its fold the right to live in a society which is free from crime and fear, and the right of witnesses to testify in courts in free and fair manner without fear or pressure – If one is unable to testify in courts due to threats or other pressures, it is a clear violation of Art. 19(1)(a) and Art. 21 – One of the main reasons for witnesses to turn hostile is that they are not accorded appropriate protection by the State – State to ensure the safety of the witnesses irrespective of case, creed, religion, such that they could safely depose the truth in the court at least in sensitive cases involving those in power, political patronage. Honour killings: Preventive steps, remedial and punitive measures to combat honour crimes – Suggestion of, in Shakti Vahini’s case – Stated. Casteism: Commission of atrocities in the name of castes – Ghastly murders of three youngsters, by physically assaulting them for nearly 12 hours for violating caste-ridden societal norms – Held: Episodes of honour killing demonstrate that the casteism has not been annihilated even after 75 years of independence – Bigotry perpetuated by such caste-based practices impedes the objective of the Constitution of equality for all its citizens – High time for the civil society to react and respond with strong disapproval about the ghastly crimes committed in the name of caste. Administration of justice: Administration of criminal justice – Racial and religiously motivated crimes, if to be treated as aggravating factors for enhanced punishment – Foreign laws-United Kingdom, Canada, United States vis-a-vis Indian laws – Discussed.",

B s. 149 – Unlawful assembly – Common object of an assembly – Held: Common object is different from common intention as it does not require a prior concert and a common meeting of minds before the attack – It is enough if each has the same object in view and their number is five or more and that they act as an assembly to achieve that object – Common object of an assembly is to be ascertained from the acts and language of the members composing it, from the surrounding circumstances and the course of conduct adopted by the members.

        "HeadNote": "Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012: s. 7 –”sexual assault” –Words touch and physical contact – Interpretation of – Held: Both the said words “touch” and “physical contact”have been interchangeably used in s. 7 by the legislature – Word “touch” has been used specifically with regard to the sexual parts of the body, whereas the word “physical contact” has been used for any other act – Thus, the act of touching the sexual part of body or any other act involving physical contact, if done with “sexual intent” would amount to “sexual assault” within the meaning of s. 7 – Expression “sexual intent” having not been explained in s. 7, it cannot be confined to any predetermined format or structure and that it would be a question of fact – However, the expression ‘physical contact’ used in s. 7 cannot be construed as ‘skin to skin’ contact – Restricting the interpretation of the words “touch” or “physical contact” to “skin to skin contact” would not only be a narrow and pedantic interpretation of s. 7 but an absurd interpretation of s. 7 which would lead to a very detrimental situation, frustrating the very object of the Act inasmuch as in that case touching the sexual or non sexual parts of the body of a child with gloves, condoms, sheets or with cloth, though done with sexual intent would not amount to an offence of sexual assault u/s. 7– “Skin to skin contact” for constituting an offence of “sexual assault” could not have been intended or contemplated by the Legislature – Most important ingredient for constituting the offence of sexual assault u/s. 7 is “sexual intent” and not “skin to skin” contact with the child. ss. 7, 8 – Offence of sexual assault – Allegation against accused S that he lured a 12 year old girl to his house, and pressed her breast and tried to remove her salwar and when the victim tried to shout, the accused pressed her mouth – Special court convicted and sentenced the accused for offences u/ss. 342, 354 and 363 IPC and s. 8 – In appeal, the High Court acquitted the accused for the offence u/s. 8 and convicted him for the offence u/s. 342 and 354 IPC – On appeal, held: High Court erred in holding that the act of pressing of breast of the child aged 12 years in absence of any specific details as to whether the top was removed or whether he inserted his hands inside the top and pressed her breast, would not fall in the definition of sexual assault, but within the definition of offence u/s. 354 IPC; and that there was no offence since there was no direct physical contact- “skin to skin” with sexual intent – Whoever, with sexual intent touches the vagina, penis, anus or breast of the child or makes the child touch the vagina, penis, anus or breast of such person or any other person, would be committing an offence of “sexual assault” – Similarly, whoever does any other act with sexual intent which involves physical contact without penetration, would also be committing the offence of “sexual assault” u/s. 7 – Prosecution was not required to prove a “skin to skin” contact for proving the charge of sexual assault u/s. 7 – Allegation of sexual intent stood proved by the prosecution – All these acts were the acts of “sexual assault” as contemplated u/s. 7, punishable u/s. 8 –Thus, the order passed by the High Court set aside and that of the trial court restored. ss. 8 and 10 r/w s. 9(m) and 12 – Allegation against accused L that he went to the house of the victim aged 5 years when no one was there, and caught the hand of the victim, moved her frock upward with one hand and lowered her pant with the other hand, and thereafter, unzipped his pant and showed his penis to her and asked her to lay down on the cot – When the mother of the victim returned, she saw one person had caught the hand of the victim and also saw the victim raising her pant – Special Court convicted and sentenced the accused for offences punishable u/s. 448 and 354-A(1)(i) IPC and ss. 8 and 10 r/w s. 9(m) and 12 – High Court upheld the conviction u/ss. 448 and 354-A(1)(i) IPC rw s.12 of the POCSO, however, set aside the conviction u/ss. 8 and 10 and modified the sentence to the extent already undergone – On appeal, held: When the alleged acts of entering the house of the prosecutrix with sexual intent to outrage her modesty, of holding her hands and opening the zip of his pant showing his penis, are held to be established by the prosecution, there was no reason for the High Court not to treat such acts as the acts of “sexual assault” within the meaning of s. 7 – Accused-L committed an offence of “sexual assault” within the meaning of s. 7 and the prosecutrix being below the age of 12 years, he had committed an offence of “aggravated sexual assault” as contemplated u/s. 9(m), liable to be punished with the imprisonment for a term not less than five years u/s. 10 – Thus, the order passed by the High Court set aside and that of the trial court are restored. Enactment of the Act – Object and reasons – Stated. Interpretation of statutes: Duty of the Court – Held: Courts should ascertain the intention of the Legislature enacting it, and should accept an interpretation or construction which promotes the object of the legislation and prevents its possible abuse. Rule of construction contained in maxim “Ut Res Magis Valeat Quam Pereat” – Held: Construction of a rule should give effect to the rule rather than destroying it – Any narrow and pedantic interpretation of the provision which would defeat the object of the provision, cannot be accepted – Where the intention of the Legislature cannot be given effect to, the courts would accept the bolder construction for the purpose of bringing about an effective result - Maxim “Ut Res Magis Valeat Quam Pereat”. Penal statue – Construction of – Held: Penal Statute enacting an offence or imposing a penalty has to be strictly construed – Thus, POCSO must be strictly constructed – However, clauses of a statute should be construed with reference to the context vis-a-vis the other provisions so as to make a consistent enactment of the whole Statute relating to the subject matter – Thus, considering the objects of the POCSO Act, its provisions, more particularly pertaining to the sexual assault, sexual harassment etc. have to be construed vis-a-vis the other provisions, so as to make the objects of the Act more meaningful and effective – Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012. Rule of lenity – Invocation of – Held: Where the legislature has manifested its intention, courts may not manufacture ambiguity in order to defeat that intent – Court should not be over zealous in searching for ambiguities or obscurities in words which are plain –  As regards s.7 of the POCSO Act, the court did not find any ambiguity or obscurity so as to invoke the Rule of Lenity – Invocation of “Rule of lenity” was misconceived – Submission that the “Rule of Lenity” requires a court to resolve statutory ambiguity in a criminal statute in favour of the accused, or to strictly construe the statute against the State, cannot be accepted since the statutory ambiguity should be invoked as a last resort of interpretation – Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012. Principle of “ejusdem generis” – Application of – Held: Principle of “ejusdem generis” should be applied only as an aid to the construction of the statute – It should not be applied where it would defeat the very legislative intent – If the specific words used in the section exhaust a class, it has to be construed that the legislative intent was to use the general word beyond the class denoted by the specific words. Crime against women: Offence of sexual assault – “Skin to skin contact” if, required to constitute an offence of sexual assault – Interpretation of expression “touch” and “sexual assault” – Analogous provisions as prevalent in foreign countries – Discussed. Words and phrases: Touch and physical contact, in the context of s. 7 of the POCSO Act – Meaning of – Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012 – s. 7.

Enactment of the Act – Object and reasons – Stated. Interpretation of statutes: Duty of the Court – Held: Courts should ascertain the intention of the Legislature enacting it, and should accept an interpretation or construction which promotes the object of the legislation and prevents its possible abuse. Rule of construction contained in maxim “Ut Res Magis Valeat Quam Pereat” – Held: Construction of a rule should give effect to the rule rather than destroying it – Any narrow and pedantic interpretation of the provision which would defeat the object of the provision, cannot be accepted – Where the intention of the Legislature cannot be given effect to, the courts would accept the bolder construction for the purpose of bringing about an effective result - Maxim “Ut Res Magis Valeat Quam Pereat”. Penal statue – Construction of – Held: Penal Statute enacting an offence or imposing a penalty has to be strictly construed – Thus, POCSO must be strictly constructed – However, clauses of a statute should be construed with reference to the context vis-a-vis the other provisions so as to make a consistent enactment of the whole Statute relating to the subject matter – Thus, considering the objects of the POCSO Act, its provisions, more particularly pertaining to the sexual assault, sexual harassment etc. have to be construed vis-a-vis the other provisions, so as to make the objects of the Act more meaningful and effective – Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012. Rule of lenity – Invocation of – Held: Where the legislature has manifested its intention, courts may not manufacture ambiguity in order to defeat that intent – Court should not be over zealous in searching for ambiguities or obscurities in words which are plain –  As regards s.7 of the POCSO Act, the court did not find any ambiguity or obscurity so as to invoke the Rule of Lenity – Invocation of “Rule of lenity” was misconceived – Submission that the “Rule of Lenity” requires a court to resolve statutory ambiguity in a criminal statute in favour of the accused, or to strictly construe the statute against the State, cannot be accepted since the statutory ambiguity should be invoked as a last resort of interpretation – Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012. Principle of “ejusdem generis” – Application of – Held: Principle of “ejusdem generis” should be applied only as an aid to the construction of the statute – It should not be applied where it would defeat the very legislative intent – If the specific words used in the section exhaust a class, it has to be construed that the legislative intent was to use the general word beyond the class denoted by the specific words. Crime against women: Offence of sexual assault – “Skin to skin contact” if, required to constitute an offence of sexual assault – Interpretation of expression “touch” and “sexual assault” – Analogous provisions as prevalent in foreign countries – Discussed. Words and phrases: Touch and physical contact, in the context of s. 7 of the POCSO Act – Meaning of – Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012 – s. 7. Practice and procedure:Certified copies of the judgments/ orders – Proper procedure for preparing the certified copies – Need for.",

        "HeadNote": "Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012: s. 7 –”sexual assault” –Words touch and physical contact – Interpretation of – Held: Both the said words “touch” and “physical contact”have been interchangeably used in s. 7 by the legislature – Word “touch” has been used specifically with regard to the sexual parts of the body, whereas the word “physical contact” has been used for any other act – Thus, the act of touching the sexual part of body or any other act involving physical contact, if done with “sexual intent” would amount to “sexual assault” within the meaning of s. 7 – Expression “sexual intent” having not been explained in s. 7, it cannot be confined to any predetermined format or structure and that it would be a question of fact – However, the expression ‘physical contact’ used in s. 7 cannot be construed as ‘skin to skin’ contact – Restricting the interpretation of the words “touch” or “physical contact” to “skin to skin contact” would not only be a narrow and pedantic interpretation of s. 7 but an absurd interpretation of s. 7 which would lead to a very detrimental situation, frustrating the very object of the Act inasmuch as in that case touching the sexual or non sexual parts of the body of a child with gloves, condoms, sheets or with cloth, though done with sexual intent would not amount to an offence of sexual assault u/s. 7– “Skin to skin contact” for constituting an offence of “sexual assault” could not have been intended or contemplated by the Legislature – Most important ingredient for constituting the offence of sexual assault u/s. 7 is “sexual intent” and not “skin to skin” contact with the child. ss. 7, 8 – Offence of sexual assault – Allegation against accused S that he lured a 12 year old girl to his house, and pressed her breast and tried to remove her salwar and when the victim tried to shout, the accused pressed her mouth – Special court convicted and sentenced the accused for offences u/ss. 342, 354 and 363 IPC and s. 8 – In appeal, the High Court acquitted the accused for the offence u/s. 8 and convicted him for the offence u/s. 342 and 354 IPC – On appeal, held: High Court erred in holding that the act of pressing of breast of the child aged 12 years in absence of any specific details as to whether the top was removed or whether he inserted his hands inside the top and pressed her breast, would not fall in the definition of sexual assault, but within the definition of offence u/s. 354 IPC; and that there was no offence since there was no direct physical contact- “skin to skin” with sexual intent – Whoever, with sexual intent touches the vagina, penis, anus or breast of the child or makes the child touch the vagina, penis, anus or breast of such person or any other person, would be committing an offence of “sexual assault” – Similarly, whoever does any other act with sexual intent which involves physical contact without penetration, would also be committing the offence of “sexual assault” u/s. 7 – Prosecution was not required to prove a “skin to skin” contact for proving the charge of sexual assault u/s. 7 – Allegation of sexual intent stood proved by the prosecution – All these acts were the acts of “sexual assault” as contemplated u/s. 7, punishable u/s. 8 –Thus, the order passed by the High Court set aside and that of the trial court restored. ss. 8 and 10 r/w s. 9(m) and 12 – Allegation against accused L that he went to the house of the victim aged 5 years when no one was there, and caught the hand of the victim, moved her frock upward with one hand and lowered her pant with the other hand, and thereafter, unzipped his pant and showed his penis to her and asked her to lay down on the cot – When the mother of the victim returned, she saw one person had caught the hand of the victim and also saw the victim raising her pant – Special Court convicted and sentenced the accused for offences punishable u/s. 448 and 354-A(1)(i) IPC and ss. 8 and 10 r/w s. 9(m) and 12 – High Court upheld the conviction u/ss. 448 and 354-A(1)(i) IPC rw s.12 of the POCSO, however, set aside the conviction u/ss. 8 and 10 and modified the sentence to the extent already undergone – On appeal, held: When the alleged acts of entering the house of the prosecutrix with sexual intent to outrage her modesty, of holding her hands and opening the zip of his pant showing his penis, are held to be established by the prosecution, there was no reason for the High Court not to treat such acts as the acts of “sexual assault” within the meaning of s. 7 – Accused-L committed an offence of “sexual assault” within the meaning of s. 7 and the prosecutrix being below the age of 12 years, he had committed an offence of “aggravated sexual assault” as contemplated u/s. 9(m), liable to be punished with the imprisonment for a term not less than five years u/s. 10 – Thus, the order passed by the High Court set aside and that of the trial court are restored. Enactment of the Act – Object and reasons – Stated. Interpretation of statutes: Duty of the Court – Held: Courts should ascertain the intention of the Legislature enacting it, and should accept an interpretation or construction which promotes the object of the legislation and prevents its possible abuse. Rule of construction contained in maxim “Ut Res Magis Valeat Quam Pereat” – Held: Construction of a rule should give effect to the rule rather than destroying it – Any narrow and pedantic interpretation of the provision which would defeat the object of the provision, cannot be accepted – Where the intention of the Legislature cannot be given effect to, the courts would accept the bolder construction for the purpose of bringing about an effective result - Maxim “Ut Res Magis Valeat Quam Pereat”. Penal statue – Construction of – Held: Penal Statute enacting an offence or imposing a penalty has to be strictly construed – Thus, POCSO must be strictly constructed – However, clauses of a statute should be construed with reference to the context vis-a-vis the other provisions so as to make a consistent enactment of the whole Statute relating to the subject matter – Thus, considering the objects of the POCSO Act, its provisions, more particularly pertaining to the sexual assault, sexual harassment etc. have to be construed vis-a-vis the other provisions, so as to make the objects of the Act more meaningful and effective – Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012. Rule of lenity – Invocation of – Held: Where the legislature has manifested its intention, courts may not manufacture ambiguity in order to defeat that intent – Court should not be over zealous in searching for ambiguities or obscurities in words which are plain –  As regards s.7 of the POCSO Act, the court did not find any ambiguity or obscurity so as to invoke the Rule of Lenity – Invocation of “Rule of lenity” was misconceived – Submission that the “Rule of Lenity” requires a court to resolve statutory ambiguity in a criminal statute in favour of the accused, or to strictly construe the statute against the State, cannot be accepted since the statutory ambiguity should be invoked as a last resort of interpretation – Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012. Principle of “ejusdem generis” – Application of – Held: Principle of “ejusdem generis” should be applied only as an aid to the construction of the statute – It should not be applied where it would defeat the very legislative intent – If the specific words used in the section exhaust a class, it has to be construed that the legislative intent was to use the general word beyond the class denoted by the specific words. Crime against women: Offence of sexual assault – “Skin to skin contact” if, required to constitute an offence of sexual assault – Interpretation of expression “touch” and “sexual assault” – Analogous provisions as prevalent in foreign countries – Discussed. Words and phrases: Touch and physical contact, in the context of s. 7 of the POCSO Act – Meaning of – Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012 – s. 7. Practice and procedure:Certified copies of the judgments/ orders – Proper procedure for preparing the certified copies – Need for.",

        "HeadNote": "Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012: s. 7 –”sexual assault” –Words touch and physical contact – Interpretation of – Held: Both the said words “touch” and “physical contact”have been interchangeably used in s. 7 by the legislature – Word “touch” has been used specifically with regard to the sexual parts of the body, whereas the word “physical contact” has been used for any other act – Thus, the act of touching the sexual part of body or any other act involving physical contact, if done with “sexual intent” would amount to “sexual assault” within the meaning of s. 7 – Expression “sexual intent” having not been explained in s. 7, it cannot be confined to any predetermined format or structure and that it would be a question of fact – However, the expression ‘physical contact’ used in s. 7 cannot be construed as ‘skin to skin’ contact – Restricting the interpretation of the words “touch” or “physical contact” to “skin to skin contact” would not only be a narrow and pedantic interpretation of s. 7 but an absurd interpretation of s. 7 which would lead to a very detrimental situation, frustrating the very object of the Act inasmuch as in that case touching the sexual or non sexual parts of the body of a child with gloves, condoms, sheets or with cloth, though done with sexual intent would not amount to an offence of sexual assault u/s. 7– “Skin to skin contact” for constituting an offence of “sexual assault” could not have been intended or contemplated by the Legislature – Most important ingredient for constituting the offence of sexual assault u/s. 7 is “sexual intent” and not “skin to skin” contact with the child. ss. 7, 8 – Offence of sexual assault – Allegation against accused S that he lured a 12 year old girl to his house, and pressed her breast and tried to remove her salwar and when the victim tried to shout, the accused pressed her mouth – Special court convicted and sentenced the accused for offences u/ss. 342, 354 and 363 IPC and s. 8 – In appeal, the High Court acquitted the accused for the offence u/s. 8 and convicted him for the offence u/s. 342 and 354 IPC – On appeal, held: High Court erred in holding that the act of pressing of breast of the child aged 12 years in absence of any specific details as to whether the top was removed or whether he inserted his hands inside the top and pressed her breast, would not fall in the definition of sexual assault, but within the definition of offence u/s. 354 IPC; and that there was no offence since there was no direct physical contact- “skin to skin” with sexual intent – Whoever, with sexual intent touches the vagina, penis, anus or breast of the child or makes the child touch the vagina, penis, anus or breast of such person or any other person, would be committing an offence of “sexual assault” – Similarly, whoever does any other act with sexual intent which involves physical contact without penetration, would also be committing the offence of “sexual assault” u/s. 7 – Prosecution was not required to prove a “skin to skin” contact for proving the charge of sexual assault u/s. 7 – Allegation of sexual intent stood proved by the prosecution – All these acts were the acts of “sexual assault” as contemplated u/s. 7, punishable u/s. 8 –Thus, the order passed by the High Court set aside and that of the trial court restored. ss. 8 and 10 r/w s. 9(m) and 12 – Allegation against accused L that he went to the house of the victim aged 5 years when no one was there, and caught the hand of the victim, moved her frock upward with one hand and lowered her pant with the other hand, and thereafter, unzipped his pant and showed his penis to her and asked her to lay down on the cot – When the mother of the victim returned, she saw one person had caught the hand of the victim and also saw the victim raising her pant – Special Court convicted and sentenced the accused for offences punishable u/s. 448 and 354-A(1)(i) IPC and ss. 8 and 10 r/w s. 9(m) and 12 – High Court upheld the conviction u/ss. 448 and 354-A(1)(i) IPC rw s.12 of the POCSO, however, set aside the conviction u/ss. 8 and 10 and modified the sentence to the extent already undergone – On appeal, held: When the alleged acts of entering the house of the prosecutrix with sexual intent to outrage her modesty, of holding her hands and opening the zip of his pant showing his penis, are held to be established by the prosecution, there was no reason for the High Court not to treat such acts as the acts of “sexual assault” within the meaning of s. 7 – Accused-L committed an offence of “sexual assault” within the meaning of s. 7 and the prosecutrix being below the age of 12 years, he had committed an offence of “aggravated sexual assault” as contemplated u/s. 9(m), liable to be punished with the imprisonment for a term not less than five years u/s. 10 – Thus, the order passed by the High Court set aside and that of the trial court are restored. Enactment of the Act – Object and reasons – Stated. Interpretation of statutes: Duty of the Court – Held: Courts should ascertain the intention of the Legislature enacting it, and should accept an interpretation or construction which promotes the object of the legislation and prevents its possible abuse. Rule of construction contained in maxim “Ut Res Magis Valeat Quam Pereat” – Held: Construction of a rule should give effect to the rule rather than destroying it – Any narrow and pedantic interpretation of the provision which would defeat the object of the provision, cannot be accepted – Where the intention of the Legislature cannot be given effect to, the courts would accept the bolder construction for the purpose of bringing about an effective result - Maxim “Ut Res Magis Valeat Quam Pereat”. Penal statue – Construction of – Held: Penal Statute enacting an offence or imposing a penalty has to be strictly construed – Thus, POCSO must be strictly constructed – However, clauses of a statute should be construed with reference to the context vis-a-vis the other provisions so as to make a consistent enactment of the whole Statute relating to the subject matter – Thus, considering the objects of the POCSO Act, its provisions, more particularly pertaining to the sexual assault, sexual harassment etc. have to be construed vis-a-vis the other provisions, so as to make the objects of the Act more meaningful and effective – Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012. Rule of lenity – Invocation of – Held: Where the legislature has manifested its intention, courts may not manufacture ambiguity in order to defeat that intent – Court should not be over zealous in searching for ambiguities or obscurities in words which are plain –  As regards s.7 of the POCSO Act, the court did not find any ambiguity or obscurity so as to invoke the Rule of Lenity – Invocation of “Rule of lenity” was misconceived – Submission that the “Rule of Lenity” requires a court to resolve statutory ambiguity in a criminal statute in favour of the accused, or to strictly construe the statute against the State, cannot be accepted since the statutory ambiguity should be invoked as a last resort of interpretation – Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012. Principle of “ejusdem generis” – Application of – Held: Principle of “ejusdem generis” should be applied only as an aid to the construction of the statute – It should not be applied where it would defeat the very legislative intent – If the specific words used in the section exhaust a class, it has to be construed that the legislative intent was to use the general word beyond the class denoted by the specific words. Crime against women: Offence of sexual assault – “Skin to skin contact” if, required to constitute an offence of sexual assault – Interpretation of expression “touch” and “sexual assault” – Analogous provisions as prevalent in foreign countries – Discussed.

        "HeadNote": "Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012: s. 7 –”sexual assault” –Words touch and physical contact – Interpretation of – Held: Both the said words “touch” and “physical contact”have been interchangeably used in s. 7 by the legislature – Word “touch” has been used specifically with regard to the sexual parts of the body, whereas the word “physical contact” has been used for any other act – Thus, the act of touching the sexual part of body or any other act involving physical contact, if done with “sexual intent” would amount to “sexual assault” within the meaning of s. 7 – Expression “sexual intent” having not been explained in s. 7, it cannot be confined to any predetermined format or structure and that it would be a question of fact – However, the expression ‘physical contact’ used in s. 7 cannot be construed as ‘skin to skin’ contact – Restricting the interpretation of the words “touch” or “physical contact” to “skin to skin contact” would not only be a narrow and pedantic interpretation of s. 7 but an absurd interpretation of s. 7 which would lead to a very detrimental situation, frustrating the very object of the Act inasmuch as in that case touching the sexual or non sexual parts of the body of a child with gloves, condoms, sheets or with cloth, though done with sexual intent would not amount to an offence of sexual assault u/s. 7– “Skin to skin contact” for constituting an offence of “sexual assault” could not have been intended or contemplated by the Legislature – Most important ingredient for constituting the offence of sexual assault u/s. 7 is “sexual intent” and not “skin to skin” contact with the child. ss. 7, 8 – Offence of sexual assault – Allegation against accused S that he lured a 12 year old girl to his house, and pressed her breast and tried to remove her salwar and when the victim tried to shout, the accused pressed her mouth – Special court convicted and sentenced the accused for offences u/ss. 342, 354 and 363 IPC and s. 8 – In appeal, the High Court acquitted the accused for the offence u/s. 8 and convicted him for the offence u/s. 342 and 354 IPC – On appeal, held: High Court erred in holding that the act of pressing of breast of the child aged 12 years in absence of any specific details as to whether the top was removed or whether he inserted his hands inside the top and pressed her breast, would not fall in the definition of sexual assault, but within the definition of offence u/s. 354 IPC; and that there was no offence since there was no direct physical contact- “skin to skin” with sexual intent – Whoever, with sexual intent touches the vagina, penis, anus or breast of the child or makes the child touch the vagina, penis, anus or breast of such person or any other person, would be committing an offence of “sexual assault” – Similarly, whoever does any other act with sexual intent which involves physical contact without penetration, would also be committing the offence of “sexual assault” u/s. 7 – Prosecution was not required to prove a “skin to skin” contact for proving the charge of sexual assault u/s. 7 – Allegation of sexual intent stood proved by the prosecution – All these acts were the acts of “sexual assault” as contemplated u/s. 7, punishable u/s. 8 –Thus, the order passed by the High Court set aside and that of the trial court restored. ss. 8 and 10 r/w s. 9(m) and 12 – Allegation against accused L that he went to the house of the victim aged 5 years when no one was there, and caught the hand of the victim, moved her frock upward with one hand and lowered her pant with the other hand, and thereafter, unzipped his pant and showed his penis to her and asked her to lay down on the cot – When the mother of the victim returned, she saw one person had caught the hand of the victim and also saw the victim raising her pant – Special Court convicted and sentenced the accused for offences punishable u/s. 448 and 354-A(1)(i) IPC and ss. 8 and 10 r/w s. 9(m) and 12 – High Court upheld the conviction u/ss. 448 and 354-A(1)(i) IPC rw s.12 of the POCSO, however, set aside the conviction u/ss. 8 and 10 and modified the sentence to the extent already undergone – On appeal, held: When the alleged acts of entering the house of the prosecutrix with sexual intent to outrage her modesty, of holding her hands and opening the zip of his pant showing his penis, are held to be established by the prosecution, there was no reason for the High Court not to treat such acts as the acts of “sexual assault” within the meaning of s. 7 – Accused-L committed an offence of “sexual assault” within the meaning of s. 7 and the prosecutrix being below the age of 12 years, he had committed an offence of “aggravated sexual assault” as contemplated u/s. 9(m), liable to be punished with the imprisonment for a term not less than five years u/s. 10 – Thus, the order passed by the High Court set aside and that of the trial court are restored. Enactment of the Act – Object and reasons – Stated. Interpretation of statutes: Duty of the Court – Held: Courts should ascertain the intention of the Legislature enacting it, and should accept an interpretation or construction which promotes the object of the legislation and prevents its possible abuse. Rule of construction contained in maxim “Ut Res Magis Valeat Quam Pereat” – Held: Construction of a rule should give effect to the rule rather than destroying it – Any narrow and pedantic interpretation of the provision which would defeat the object of the provision, cannot be accepted – Where the intention of the Legislature cannot be given effect to, the courts would accept the bolder construction for the purpose of bringing about an effective result - Maxim “Ut Res Magis Valeat Quam Pereat”. Penal statue – Construction of – Held: Penal Statute enacting an offence or imposing a penalty has to be strictly construed – Thus, POCSO must be strictly constructed – However, clauses of a statute should be construed with reference to the context vis-a-vis the other provisions so as to make a consistent enactment of the whole Statute relating to the subject matter – Thus, considering the objects of the POCSO Act, its provisions, more particularly pertaining to the sexual assault, sexual harassment etc. have to be construed vis-a-vis the other provisions, so as to make the objects of the Act more meaningful and effective – Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012. Rule of lenity – Invocation of – Held: Where the legislature has manifested its intention, courts may not manufacture ambiguity in order to defeat that intent – Court should not be over zealous in searching for ambiguities or obscurities in words which are plain –  As regards s.7 of the POCSO Act, the court did not find any ambiguity or obscurity so as to invoke the Rule of Lenity – Invocation of “Rule of lenity” was misconceived – Submission that the “Rule of Lenity” requires a court to resolve statutory ambiguity in a criminal statute in favour of the accused, or to strictly construe the statute against the State, cannot be accepted since the statutory ambiguity should be invoked as a last resort of interpretation – Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012. Principle of “ejusdem generis” – Application of – Held: Principle of “ejusdem generis” should be applied only as an aid to the construction of the statute – It should not be applied where it would defeat the very legislative intent – If the specific words used in the section exhaust a class, it has to be construed that the legislative intent was to use the general word beyond the class denoted by the specific words. Crime against women: Offence of sexual assault – “Skin to skin contact” if, required to constitute an offence of sexual assault – Interpretation of expression “touch” and “sexual assault” – Analogous provisions as prevalent in foreign countries – Discussed. Words and phrases: Touch and physical contact, in the context of s. 7 of the POCSO Act – Meaning of – Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012 – s. 7. Practice and procedure:Certified copies of the judgments/ orders – Proper procedure for preparing the certified copies – Need for.",

        "HeadNote": "Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012: s. 7 –”sexual assault” –Words touch and physical contact – Interpretation of – Held: Both the said words “touch” and “physical contact”have been interchangeably used in s. 7 by the legislature – Word “touch” has been used specifically with regard to the sexual parts of the body, whereas the word “physical contact” has been used for any other act – Thus, the act of touching the sexual part of body or any other act involving physical contact, if done with “sexual intent” would amount to “sexual assault” within the meaning of s. 7 – Expression “sexual intent” having not been explained in s. 7, it cannot be confined to any predetermined format or structure and that it would be a question of fact – However, the expression ‘physical contact’ used in s. 7 cannot be construed as ‘skin to skin’ contact – Restricting the interpretation of the words “touch” or “physical contact” to “skin to skin contact” would not only be a narrow and pedantic interpretation of s. 7 but an absurd interpretation of s. 7 which would lead to a very detrimental situation, frustrating the very object of the Act inasmuch as in that case touching the sexual or non sexual parts of the body of a child with gloves, condoms, sheets or with cloth, though done with sexual intent would not amount to an offence of sexual assault u/s. 7– “Skin to skin contact” for constituting an offence of “sexual assault” could not have been intended or contemplated by the Legislature – Most important ingredient for constituting the offence of sexual assault u/s. 7 is “sexual intent” and not “skin to skin” contact with the child. ss. 7, 8 – Offence of sexual assault – Allegation against accused S that he lured a 12 year old girl to his house, and pressed her breast and tried to remove her salwar and when the victim tried to shout, the accused pressed her mouth – Special court convicted and sentenced the accused for offences u/ss. 342, 354 and 363 IPC and s. 8 – In appeal, the High Court acquitted the accused for the offence u/s. 8 and convicted him for the offence u/s. 342 and 354 IPC – On appeal, held: High Court erred in holding that the act of pressing of breast of the child aged 12 years in absence of any specific details as to whether the top was removed or whether he inserted his hands inside the top and pressed her breast, would not fall in the definition of sexual assault, but within the definition of offence u/s. 354 IPC; and that there was no offence since there was no direct physical contact- “skin to skin” with sexual intent – Whoever, with sexual intent touches the vagina, penis, anus or breast of the child or makes the child touch the vagina, penis, anus or breast of such person or any other person, would be committing an offence of “sexual assault” – Similarly, whoever does any other act with sexual intent which involves physical contact without penetration, would also be committing the offence of “sexual assault” u/s. 7 – Prosecution was not required to prove a “skin to skin” contact for proving the charge of sexual assault u/s. 7 – Allegation of sexual intent stood proved by the prosecution – All these acts were the acts of “sexual assault” as contemplated u/s. 7, punishable u/s. 8 –Thus, the order passed by the High Court set aside and that of the trial court restored. ss. 8 and 10 r/w s. 9(m) and 12 – Allegation against accused L that he went to the house of the victim aged 5 years when no one was there, and caught the hand of the victim, moved her frock upward with one hand and lowered her pant with the other hand, and thereafter, unzipped his pant and showed his penis to her and asked her to lay down on the cot – When the mother of the victim returned, she saw one person had caught the hand of the victim and also saw the victim raising her pant – Special Court convicted and sentenced the accused for offences punishable u/s. 448 and 354-A(1)(i) IPC and ss. 8 and 10 r/w s. 9(m) and 12 – High Court upheld the conviction u/ss. 448 and 354-A(1)(i) IPC rw s.12 of the POCSO, however, set aside the conviction u/ss. 8 and 10 and modified the sentence to the extent already undergone – On appeal, held: When the alleged acts of entering the house of the prosecutrix with sexual intent to outrage her modesty, of holding her hands and opening the zip of his pant showing his penis, are held to be established by the prosecution, there was no reason for the High Court not to treat such acts as the acts of “sexual assault” within the meaning of s. 7 – Accused-L committed an offence of “sexual assault” within the meaning of s. 7 and the prosecutrix being below the age of 12 years, he had committed an offence of “aggravated sexual assault” as contemplated u/s. 9(m), liable to be punished with the imprisonment for a term not less than five years u/s. 10 – Thus, the order passed by the High Court set aside and that of the trial court are restored. Enactment of the Act – Object and reasons – Stated. Interpretation of statutes: Duty of the Court – Held: Courts should ascertain the intention of the Legislature enacting it, and should accept an interpretation or construction which promotes the object of the legislation and prevents its possible abuse. Rule of construction contained in maxim “Ut Res Magis Valeat Quam Pereat” – Held: Construction of a rule should give effect to the rule rather than destroying it – Any narrow and pedantic interpretation of the provision which would defeat the object of the provision, cannot be accepted – Where the intention of the Legislature cannot be given effect to, the courts would accept the bolder construction for the purpose of bringing about an effective result - Maxim “Ut Res Magis Valeat Quam Pereat”. Penal statue – Construction of – Held: Penal Statute enacting an offence or imposing a penalty has to be strictly construed – Thus, POCSO must be strictly constructed – However, clauses of a statute should be construed with reference to the context vis-a-vis the other provisions so as to make a consistent enactment of the whole Statute relating to the subject matter – Thus, considering the objects of the POCSO Act, its provisions, more particularly pertaining to the sexual assault, sexual harassment etc. have to be construed vis-a-vis the other provisions, so as to make the objects of the Act more meaningful and effective – Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012. Rule of lenity – Invocation of – Held: Where the legislature has manifested its intention, courts may not manufacture ambiguity in order to defeat that intent – Court should not be over zealous in searching for ambiguities or obscurities in words which are plain –  As regards s.7 of the POCSO Act, the court did not find any ambiguity or obscurity so as to invoke the Rule of Lenity – Invocation of “Rule of lenity” was misconceived – Submission that the “Rule of Lenity” requires a court to resolve statutory ambiguity in a criminal statute in favour of the accused, or to strictly construe the statute against the State, cannot be accepted since the statutory ambiguity should be invoked as a last resort of interpretation – Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012. Principle of “ejusdem generis” – Application of – Held: Principle of “ejusdem generis” should be applied only as an aid to the construction of the statute – It should not be applied where it would defeat the very legislative intent – If the specific words used in the section exhaust a class, it has to be construed that the legislative intent was to use the general word beyond the class denoted by the specific words. Crime against women: Offence of sexual assault – “Skin to skin contact” if, required to constitute an offence of sexual assault – Interpretation of expression “touch” and “sexual assault” – Analogous provisions as prevalent in foreign countries – Discussed. Words and phrases: Touch and physical contact, in the context of s. 7 of the POCSO Act – Meaning of – Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012 – s. 7. Practice and procedure:Certified copies of the judgments/ orders – Proper procedure for preparing the certified copies – Need for.",

        "HeadNote": "Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012: s. 7 –”sexual assault” –Words touch and physical contact – Interpretation of – Held: Both the said words “touch” and “physical contact”have been interchangeably used in s. 7 by the legislature – Word “touch” has been used specifically with regard to the sexual parts of the body, whereas the word “physical contact” has been used for any other act – Thus, the act of touching the sexual part of body or any other act involving physical contact, if done with “sexual intent” would amount to “sexual assault” within the meaning of s. 7 – Expression “sexual intent” having not been explained in s. 7, it cannot be confined to any predetermined format or structure and that it would be a question of fact – However, the expression ‘physical contact’ used in s. 7 cannot be construed as ‘skin to skin’ contact – Restricting the interpretation of the words “touch” or “physical contact” to “skin to skin contact” would not only be a narrow and pedantic interpretation of s. 7 but an absurd interpretation of s. 7 which would lead to a very detrimental situation, frustrating the very object of the Act inasmuch as in that case touching the sexual or non sexual parts of the body of a child with gloves, condoms, sheets or with cloth, though done with sexual intent would not amount to an offence of sexual assault u/s. 7– “Skin to skin contact” for constituting an offence of “sexual assault” could not have been intended or contemplated by the Legislature – Most important ingredient for constituting the offence of sexual assault u/s. 7 is “sexual intent” and not “skin to skin” contact with the child. ss. 7, 8 – Offence of sexual assault – Allegation against accused S that he lured a 12 year old girl to his house, and pressed her breast and tried to remove her salwar and when the victim tried to shout, the accused pressed her mouth – Special court convicted and sentenced the accused for offences u/ss. 342, 354 and 363 IPC and s. 8 – In appeal, the High Court acquitted the accused for the offence u/s. 8 and convicted him for the offence u/s. 342 and 354 IPC – On appeal, held: High Court erred in holding that the act of pressing of breast of the child aged 12 years in absence of any specific details as to whether the top was removed or whether he inserted his hands inside the top and pressed her breast, would not fall in the definition of sexual assault, but within the definition of offence u/s. 354 IPC; and that there was no offence since there was no direct physical contact- “skin to skin” with sexual intent – Whoever, with sexual intent touches the vagina, penis, anus or breast of the child or makes the child touch the vagina, penis, anus or breast of such person or any other person, would be committing an offence of “sexual assault” – Similarly, whoever does any other act with sexual intent which involves physical contact without penetration, would also be committing the offence of “sexual assault” u/s. 7 – Prosecution was not required to prove a “skin to skin” contact for proving the charge of sexual assault u/s. 7 – Allegation of sexual intent stood proved by the prosecution – All these acts were the acts of “sexual assault” as contemplated u/s. 7, punishable u/s. 8 –Thus, the order passed by the High Court set aside and that of the trial court restored. ss. 8 and 10 r/w s. 9(m) and 12 – Allegation against accused L that he went to the house of the victim aged 5 years when no one was there, and caught the hand of the victim, moved her frock upward with one hand and lowered her pant with the other hand, and thereafter, unzipped his pant and showed his penis to her and asked her to lay down on the cot – When the mother of the victim returned, she saw one person had caught the hand of the victim and also saw the victim raising her pant – Special Court convicted and sentenced the accused for offences punishable u/s. 448 and 354-A(1)(i) IPC and ss. 8 and 10 r/w s. 9(m) and 12 – High Court upheld the conviction u/ss. 448 and 354-A(1)(i) IPC rw s.12 of the POCSO, however, set aside the conviction u/ss. 8 and 10 and modified the sentence to the extent already undergone – On appeal, held: When the alleged acts of entering the house of the prosecutrix with sexual intent to outrage her modesty, of holding her hands and opening the zip of his pant showing his penis, are held to be established by the prosecution, there was no reason for the High Court not to treat such acts as the acts of “sexual assault” within the meaning of s. 7 – Accused-L committed an offence of “sexual assault” within the meaning of s. 7 and the prosecutrix being below the age of 12 years, he had committed an offence of “aggravated sexual assault” as contemplated u/s. 9(m), liable to be punished with the imprisonment for a term not less than five years u/s. 10 – Thus, the order passed by the High Court set aside and that of the trial court are restored. Enactment of the Act – Object and reasons – Stated.

Rule of construction contained in maxim “Ut Res Magis Valeat Quam Pereat” – Held: Construction of a rule should give effect to the rule rather than destroying it – Any narrow and pedantic interpretation of the provision which would defeat the object of the provision, cannot be accepted – Where the intention of the Legislature cannot be given effect to, the courts would accept the bolder construction for the purpose of bringing about an effective result - Maxim “Ut Res Magis Valeat Quam Pereat”. Penal statue – Construction of – Held: Penal Statute enacting an offence or imposing a penalty has to be strictly construed – Thus, POCSO must be strictly constructed – However, clauses of a statute should be construed with reference to the context vis-a-vis the other provisions so as to make a consistent enactment of the whole Statute relating to the subject matter – Thus, considering the objects of the POCSO Act, its provisions, more particularly pertaining to the sexual assault, sexual harassment etc. have to be construed vis-a-vis the other provisions, so as to make the objects of the Act more meaningful and effective – Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012. Rule of lenity – Invocation of – Held: Where the legislature has manifested its intention, courts may not manufacture ambiguity in order to defeat that intent – Court should not be over zealous in searching for ambiguities or obscurities in words which are plain –  As regards s.7 of the POCSO Act, the court did not find any ambiguity or obscurity so as to invoke the Rule of Lenity – Invocation of “Rule of lenity” was misconceived – Submission that the “Rule of Lenity” requires a court to resolve statutory ambiguity in a criminal statute in favour of the accused, or to strictly construe the statute against the State, cannot be accepted since the statutory ambiguity should be invoked as a last resort of interpretation – Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012. Principle of “ejusdem generis” – Application of – Held: Principle of “ejusdem generis” should be applied only as an aid to the construction of the statute – It should not be applied where it would defeat the very legislative intent – If the specific words used in the section exhaust a class, it has to be construed that the legislative intent was to use the general word beyond the class denoted by the specific words.

        "HeadNote": "Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012: s. 7 –”sexual assault” –Words touch and physical contact – Interpretation of – Held: Both the said words “touch” and “physical contact”have been interchangeably used in s. 7 by the legislature – Word “touch” has been used specifically with regard to the sexual parts of the body, whereas the word “physical contact” has been used for any other act – Thus, the act of touching the sexual part of body or any other act involving physical contact, if done with “sexual intent” would amount to “sexual assault” within the meaning of s. 7 – Expression “sexual intent” having not been explained in s. 7, it cannot be confined to any predetermined format or structure and that it would be a question of fact – However, the expression ‘physical contact’ used in s. 7 cannot be construed as ‘skin to skin’ contact – Restricting the interpretation of the words “touch” or “physical contact” to “skin to skin contact” would not only be a narrow and pedantic interpretation of s. 7 but an absurd interpretation of s. 7 which would lead to a very detrimental situation, frustrating the very object of the Act inasmuch as in that case touching the sexual or non sexual parts of the body of a child with gloves, condoms, sheets or with cloth, though done with sexual intent would not amount to an offence of sexual assault u/s. 7– “Skin to skin contact” for constituting an offence of “sexual assault” could not have been intended or contemplated by the Legislature – Most important ingredient for constituting the offence of sexual assault u/s. 7 is “sexual intent” and not “skin to skin” contact with the child. ss. 7, 8 – Offence of sexual assault – Allegation against accused S that he lured a 12 year old girl to his house, and pressed her breast and tried to remove her salwar and when the victim tried to shout, the accused pressed her mouth – Special court convicted and sentenced the accused for offences u/ss. 342, 354 and 363 IPC and s. 8 – In appeal, the High Court acquitted the accused for the offence u/s. 8 and convicted him for the offence u/s. 342 and 354 IPC – On appeal, held: High Court erred in holding that the act of pressing of breast of the child aged 12 years in absence of any specific details as to whether the top was removed or whether he inserted his hands inside the top and pressed her breast, would not fall in the definition of sexual assault, but within the definition of offence u/s. 354 IPC; and that there was no offence since there was no direct physical contact- “skin to skin” with sexual intent – Whoever, with sexual intent touches the vagina, penis, anus or breast of the child or makes the child touch the vagina, penis, anus or breast of such person or any other person, would be committing an offence of “sexual assault” – Similarly, whoever does any other act with sexual intent which involves physical contact without penetration, would also be committing the offence of “sexual assault” u/s. 7 – Prosecution was not required to prove a “skin to skin” contact for proving the charge of sexual assault u/s. 7 – Allegation of sexual intent stood proved by the prosecution – All these acts were the acts of “sexual assault” as contemplated u/s. 7, punishable u/s. 8 –Thus, the order passed by the High Court set aside and that of the trial court restored. ss. 8 and 10 r/w s. 9(m) and 12 – Allegation against accused L that he went to the house of the victim aged 5 years when no one was there, and caught the hand of the victim, moved her frock upward with one hand and lowered her pant with the other hand, and thereafter, unzipped his pant and showed his penis to her and asked her to lay down on the cot – When the mother of the victim returned, she saw one person had caught the hand of the victim and also saw the victim raising her pant – Special Court convicted and sentenced the accused for offences punishable u/s. 448 and 354-A(1)(i) IPC and ss. 8 and 10 r/w s. 9(m) and 12 – High Court upheld the conviction u/ss. 448 and 354-A(1)(i) IPC rw s.12 of the POCSO, however, set aside the conviction u/ss. 8 and 10 and modified the sentence to the extent already undergone – On appeal, held: When the alleged acts of entering the house of the prosecutrix with sexual intent to outrage her modesty, of holding her hands and opening the zip of his pant showing his penis, are held to be established by the prosecution, there was no reason for the High Court not to treat such acts as the acts of “sexual assault” within the meaning of s. 7 – Accused-L committed an offence of “sexual assault” within the meaning of s. 7 and the prosecutrix being below the age of 12 years, he had committed an offence of “aggravated sexual assault” as contemplated u/s. 9(m), liable to be punished with the imprisonment for a term not less than five years u/s. 10 – Thus, the order passed by the High Court set aside and that of the trial court are restored. Enactment of the Act – Object and reasons – Stated. Interpretation of statutes: Duty of the Court – Held: Courts should ascertain the intention of the Legislature enacting it, and should accept an interpretation or construction which promotes the object of the legislation and prevents its possible abuse. Rule of construction contained in maxim “Ut Res Magis Valeat Quam Pereat” – Held: Construction of a rule should give effect to the rule rather than destroying it – Any narrow and pedantic interpretation of the provision which would defeat the object of the provision, cannot be accepted – Where the intention of the Legislature cannot be given effect to, the courts would accept the bolder construction for the purpose of bringing about an effective result - Maxim “Ut Res Magis Valeat Quam Pereat”. Penal statue – Construction of – Held: Penal Statute enacting an offence or imposing a penalty has to be strictly construed – Thus, POCSO must be strictly constructed – However, clauses of a statute should be construed with reference to the context vis-a-vis the other provisions so as to make a consistent enactment of the whole Statute relating to the subject matter – Thus, considering the objects of the POCSO Act, its provisions, more particularly pertaining to the sexual assault, sexual harassment etc. have to be construed vis-a-vis the other provisions, so as to make the objects of the Act more meaningful and effective – Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012. Rule of lenity – Invocation of – Held: Where the legislature has manifested its intention, courts may not manufacture ambiguity in order to defeat that intent – Court should not be over zealous in searching for ambiguities or obscurities in words which are plain –  As regards s.7 of the POCSO Act, the court did not find any ambiguity or obscurity so as to invoke the Rule of Lenity – Invocation of “Rule of lenity” was misconceived – Submission that the “Rule of Lenity” requires a court to resolve statutory ambiguity in a criminal statute in favour of the accused, or to strictly construe the statute against the State, cannot be accepted since the statutory ambiguity should be invoked as a last resort of interpretation – Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012. Principle of “ejusdem generis” – Application of – Held: Principle of “ejusdem generis” should be applied only as an aid to the construction of the statute – It should not be applied where it would defeat the very legislative intent – If the specific words used in the section exhaust a class, it has to be construed that the legislative intent was to use the general word beyond the class denoted by the specific words. Crime against women: Offence of sexual assault – “Skin to skin contact” if, required to constitute an offence of sexual assault – Interpretation of expression “touch” and “sexual assault” – Analogous provisions as prevalent in foreign countries – Discussed. Words and phrases: Touch and physical contact, in the context of s. 7 of the POCSO Act – Meaning of – Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012 – s. 7. Practice and procedure:Certified copies of the judgments/ orders – Proper procedure for preparing the certified copies – Need for.",

        "HeadNote": "Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012: s. 7 –”sexual assault” –Words touch and physical contact – Interpretation of – Held: Both the said words “touch” and “physical contact”have been interchangeably used in s. 7 by the legislature – Word “touch” has been used specifically with regard to the sexual parts of the body, whereas the word “physical contact” has been used for any other act – Thus, the act of touching the sexual part of body or any other act involving physical contact, if done with “sexual intent” would amount to “sexual assault” within the meaning of s. 7 – Expression “sexual intent” having not been explained in s. 7, it cannot be confined to any predetermined format or structure and that it would be a question of fact – However, the expression ‘physical contact’ used in s. 7 cannot be construed as ‘skin to skin’ contact – Restricting the interpretation of the words “touch” or “physical contact” to “skin to skin contact” would not only be a narrow and pedantic interpretation of s. 7 but an absurd interpretation of s. 7 which would lead to a very detrimental situation, frustrating the very object of the Act inasmuch as in that case touching the sexual or non sexual parts of the body of a child with gloves, condoms, sheets or with cloth, though done with sexual intent would not amount to an offence of sexual assault u/s. 7– “Skin to skin contact” for constituting an offence of “sexual assault” could not have been intended or contemplated by the Legislature – Most important ingredient for constituting the offence of sexual assault u/s. 7 is “sexual intent” and not “skin to skin” contact with the child. ss. 7, 8 – Offence of sexual assault – Allegation against accused S that he lured a 12 year old girl to his house, and pressed her breast and tried to remove her salwar and when the victim tried to shout, the accused pressed her mouth – Special court convicted and sentenced the accused for offences u/ss. 342, 354 and 363 IPC and s. 8 – In appeal, the High Court acquitted the accused for the offence u/s. 8 and convicted him for the offence u/s. 342 and 354 IPC – On appeal, held: High Court erred in holding that the act of pressing of breast of the child aged 12 years in absence of any specific details as to whether the top was removed or whether he inserted his hands inside the top and pressed her breast, would not fall in the definition of sexual assault, but within the definition of offence u/s. 354 IPC; and that there was no offence since there was no direct physical contact- “skin to skin” with sexual intent – Whoever, with sexual intent touches the vagina, penis, anus or breast of the child or makes the child touch the vagina, penis, anus or breast of such person or any other person, would be committing an offence of “sexual assault” – Similarly, whoever does any other act with sexual intent which involves physical contact without penetration, would also be committing the offence of “sexual assault” u/s. 7 – Prosecution was not required to prove a “skin to skin” contact for proving the charge of sexual assault u/s. 7 – Allegation of sexual intent stood proved by the prosecution – All these acts were the acts of “sexual assault” as contemplated u/s. 7, punishable u/s. 8 –Thus, the order passed by the High Court set aside and that of the trial court restored. ss. 8 and 10 r/w s. 9(m) and 12 – Allegation against accused L that he went to the house of the victim aged 5 years when no one was there, and caught the hand of the victim, moved her frock upward with one hand and lowered her pant with the other hand, and thereafter, unzipped his pant and showed his penis to her and asked her to lay down on the cot – When the mother of the victim returned, she saw one person had caught the hand of the victim and also saw the victim raising her pant – Special Court convicted and sentenced the accused for offences punishable u/s. 448 and 354-A(1)(i) IPC and ss. 8 and 10 r/w s. 9(m) and 12 – High Court upheld the conviction u/ss. 448 and 354-A(1)(i) IPC rw s.12 of the POCSO, however, set aside the conviction u/ss. 8 and 10 and modified the sentence to the extent already undergone – On appeal, held: When the alleged acts of entering the house of the prosecutrix with sexual intent to outrage her modesty, of holding her hands and opening the zip of his pant showing his penis, are held to be established by the prosecution, there was no reason for the High Court not to treat such acts as the acts of “sexual assault” within the meaning of s. 7 – Accused-L committed an offence of “sexual assault” within the meaning of s. 7 and the prosecutrix being below the age of 12 years, he had committed an offence of “aggravated sexual assault” as contemplated u/s. 9(m), liable to be punished with the imprisonment for a term not less than five years u/s. 10 – Thus, the order passed by the High Court set aside and that of the trial court are restored. Enactment of the Act – Object and reasons – Stated. Interpretation of statutes: Duty of the Court – Held: Courts should ascertain the intention of the Legislature enacting it, and should accept an interpretation or construction which promotes the object of the legislation and prevents its possible abuse. Rule of construction contained in maxim “Ut Res Magis Valeat Quam Pereat” – Held: Construction of a rule should give effect to the rule rather than destroying it – Any narrow and pedantic interpretation of the provision which would defeat the object of the provision, cannot be accepted – Where the intention of the Legislature cannot be given effect to, the courts would accept the bolder construction for the purpose of bringing about an effective result - Maxim “Ut Res Magis Valeat Quam Pereat”. Penal statue – Construction of – Held: Penal Statute enacting an offence or imposing a penalty has to be strictly construed – Thus, POCSO must be strictly constructed – However, clauses of a statute should be construed with reference to the context vis-a-vis the other provisions so as to make a consistent enactment of the whole Statute relating to the subject matter – Thus, considering the objects of the POCSO Act, its provisions, more particularly pertaining to the sexual assault, sexual harassment etc. have to be construed vis-a-vis the other provisions, so as to make the objects of the Act more meaningful and effective – Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012. Rule of lenity – Invocation of – Held: Where the legislature has manifested its intention, courts may not manufacture ambiguity in order to defeat that intent – Court should not be over zealous in searching for ambiguities or obscurities in words which are plain –  As regards s.7 of the POCSO Act, the court did not find any ambiguity or obscurity so as to invoke the Rule of Lenity – Invocation of “Rule of lenity” was misconceived – Submission that the “Rule of Lenity” requires a court to resolve statutory ambiguity in a criminal statute in favour of the accused, or to strictly construe the statute against the State, cannot be accepted since the statutory ambiguity should be invoked as a last resort of interpretation – Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012. Principle of “ejusdem generis” – Application of – Held: Principle of “ejusdem generis” should be applied only as an aid to the construction of the statute – It should not be applied where it would defeat the very legislative intent – If the specific words used in the section exhaust a class, it has to be construed that the legislative intent was to use the general word beyond the class denoted by the specific words. Crime against women: Offence of sexual assault – “Skin to skin contact” if, required to constitute an offence of sexual assault – Interpretation of expression “touch” and “sexual assault” – Analogous provisions as prevalent in foreign countries – Discussed. Words and phrases: Touch and physical contact, in the context of s. 7 of the POCSO Act – Meaning of – Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012 – s. 7. Practice and procedure:Certified copies of the judgments/ orders – Proper procedure for preparing the certified copies – Need for.",

        "HeadNote": "Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012: s. 7 –”sexual assault” –Words touch and physical contact – Interpretation of – Held: Both the said words “touch” and “physical contact”have been interchangeably used in s. 7 by the legislature – Word “touch” has been used specifically with regard to the sexual parts of the body, whereas the word “physical contact” has been used for any other act – Thus, the act of touching the sexual part of body or any other act involving physical contact, if done with “sexual intent” would amount to “sexual assault” within the meaning of s. 7 – Expression “sexual intent” having not been explained in s. 7, it cannot be confined to any predetermined format or structure and that it would be a question of fact – However, the expression ‘physical contact’ used in s. 7 cannot be construed as ‘skin to skin’ contact – Restricting the interpretation of the words “touch” or “physical contact” to “skin to skin contact” would not only be a narrow and pedantic interpretation of s. 7 but an absurd interpretation of s. 7 which would lead to a very detrimental situation, frustrating the very object of the Act inasmuch as in that case touching the sexual or non sexual parts of the body of a child with gloves, condoms, sheets or with cloth, though done with sexual intent would not amount to an offence of sexual assault u/s. 7– “Skin to skin contact” for constituting an offence of “sexual assault” could not have been intended or contemplated by the Legislature – Most important ingredient for constituting the offence of sexual assault u/s. 7 is “sexual intent” and not “skin to skin” contact with the child. ss. 7, 8 – Offence of sexual assault – Allegation against accused S that he lured a 12 year old girl to his house, and pressed her breast and tried to remove her salwar and when the victim tried to shout, the accused pressed her mouth – Special court convicted and sentenced the accused for offences u/ss. 342, 354 and 363 IPC and s. 8 – In appeal, the High Court acquitted the accused for the offence u/s. 8 and convicted him for the offence u/s. 342 and 354 IPC – On appeal, held: High Court erred in holding that the act of pressing of breast of the child aged 12 years in absence of any specific details as to whether the top was removed or whether he inserted his hands inside the top and pressed her breast, would not fall in the definition of sexual assault, but within the definition of offence u/s. 354 IPC; and that there was no offence since there was no direct physical contact- “skin to skin” with sexual intent – Whoever, with sexual intent touches the vagina, penis, anus or breast of the child or makes the child touch the vagina, penis, anus or breast of such person or any other person, would be committing an offence of “sexual assault” – Similarly, whoever does any other act with sexual intent which involves physical contact without penetration, would also be committing the offence of “sexual assault” u/s. 7 – Prosecution was not required to prove a “skin to skin” contact for proving the charge of sexual assault u/s. 7 – Allegation of sexual intent stood proved by the prosecution – All these acts were the acts of “sexual assault” as contemplated u/s. 7, punishable u/s. 8 –Thus, the order passed by the High Court set aside and that of the trial court restored. ss. 8 and 10 r/w s. 9(m) and 12 – Allegation against accused L that he went to the house of the victim aged 5 years when no one was there, and caught the hand of the victim, moved her frock upward with one hand and lowered her pant with the other hand, and thereafter, unzipped his pant and showed his penis to her and asked her to lay down on the cot – When the mother of the victim returned, she saw one person had caught the hand of the victim and also saw the victim raising her pant – Special Court convicted and sentenced the accused for offences punishable u/s. 448 and 354-A(1)(i) IPC and ss. 8 and 10 r/w s. 9(m) and 12 – High Court upheld the conviction u/ss. 448 and 354-A(1)(i) IPC rw s.12 of the POCSO, however, set aside the conviction u/ss. 8 and 10 and modified the sentence to the extent already undergone – On appeal, held: When the alleged acts of entering the house of the prosecutrix with sexual intent to outrage her modesty, of holding her hands and opening the zip of his pant showing his penis, are held to be established by the prosecution, there was no reason for the High Court not to treat such acts as the acts of “sexual assault” within the meaning of s. 7 – Accused-L committed an offence of “sexual assault” within the meaning of s. 7 and the prosecutrix being below the age of 12 years, he had committed an offence of “aggravated sexual assault” as contemplated u/s. 9(m), liable to be punished with the imprisonment for a term not less than five years u/s. 10 – Thus, the order passed by the High Court set aside and that of the trial court are restored. Enactment of the Act – Object and reasons – Stated. Interpretation of statutes: Duty of the Court – Held: Courts should ascertain the intention of the Legislature enacting it, and should accept an interpretation or construction which promotes the object of the legislation and prevents its possible abuse. Rule of construction contained in maxim “Ut Res Magis Valeat Quam Pereat” – Held: Construction of a rule should give effect to the rule rather than destroying it – Any narrow and pedantic interpretation of the provision which would defeat the object of the provision, cannot be accepted – Where the intention of the Legislature cannot be given effect to, the courts would accept the bolder construction for the purpose of bringing about an effective result - Maxim “Ut Res Magis Valeat Quam Pereat”. Penal statue – Construction of – Held: Penal Statute enacting an offence or imposing a penalty has to be strictly construed – Thus, POCSO must be strictly constructed – However, clauses of a statute should be construed with reference to the context vis-a-vis the other provisions so as to make a consistent enactment of the whole Statute relating to the subject matter – Thus, considering the objects of the POCSO Act, its provisions, more particularly pertaining to the sexual assault, sexual harassment etc. have to be construed vis-a-vis the other provisions, so as to make the objects of the Act more meaningful and effective – Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012. Rule of lenity – Invocation of – Held: Where the legislature has manifested its intention, courts may not manufacture ambiguity in order to defeat that intent – Court should not be over zealous in searching for ambiguities or obscurities in words which are plain –  As regards s.7 of the POCSO Act, the court did not find any ambiguity or obscurity so as to invoke the Rule of Lenity – Invocation of “Rule of lenity” was misconceived – Submission that the “Rule of Lenity” requires a court to resolve statutory ambiguity in a criminal statute in favour of the accused, or to strictly construe the statute against the State, cannot be accepted since the statutory ambiguity should be invoked as a last resort of interpretation – Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012. Principle of “ejusdem generis” – Application of – Held: Principle of “ejusdem generis” should be applied only as an aid to the construction of the statute – It should not be applied where it would defeat the very legislative intent – If the specific words used in the section exhaust a class, it has to be construed that the legislative intent was to use the general word beyond the class denoted by the specific words. Crime against women: Offence of sexual assault – “Skin to skin contact” if, required to constitute an offence of sexual assault – Interpretation of expression “touch” and “sexual assault” – Analogous provisions as prevalent in foreign countries – Discussed. Words and phrases: Touch and physical contact, in the context of s. 7 of the POCSO Act – Meaning of – Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012 – s. 7.

Enactment of the Act – Object and reasons – Stated. Interpretation of statutes: Duty of the Court – Held: Courts should ascertain the intention of the Legislature enacting it, and should accept an interpretation or construction which promotes the object of the legislation and prevents its possible abuse. Rule of construction contained in maxim “Ut Res Magis Valeat Quam Pereat” – Held: Construction of a rule should give effect to the rule rather than destroying it – Any narrow and pedantic interpretation of the provision which would defeat the object of the provision, cannot be accepted – Where the intention of the Legislature cannot be given effect to, the courts would accept the bolder construction for the purpose of bringing about an effective result - Maxim “Ut Res Magis Valeat Quam Pereat”. Penal statue – Construction of – Held: Penal Statute enacting an offence or imposing a penalty has to be strictly construed – Thus, POCSO must be strictly constructed – However, clauses of a statute should be construed with reference to the context vis-a-vis the other provisions so as to make a consistent enactment of the whole Statute relating to the subject matter – Thus, considering the objects of the POCSO Act, its provisions, more particularly pertaining to the sexual assault, sexual harassment etc. have to be construed vis-a-vis the other provisions, so as to make the objects of the Act more meaningful and effective – Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012. Rule of lenity – Invocation of – Held: Where the legislature has manifested its intention, courts may not manufacture ambiguity in order to defeat that intent – Court should not be over zealous in searching for ambiguities or obscurities in words which are plain –  As regards s.7 of the POCSO Act, the court did not find any ambiguity or obscurity so as to invoke the Rule of Lenity – Invocation of “Rule of lenity” was misconceived – Submission that the “Rule of Lenity” requires a court to resolve statutory ambiguity in a criminal statute in favour of the accused, or to strictly construe the statute against the State, cannot be accepted since the statutory ambiguity should be invoked as a last resort of interpretation – Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012. Principle of “ejusdem generis” – Application of – Held: Principle of “ejusdem generis” should be applied only as an aid to the construction of the statute – It should not be applied where it would defeat the very legislative intent – If the specific words used in the section exhaust a class, it has to be construed that the legislative intent was to use the general word beyond the class denoted by the specific words.

        "HeadNote": "Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012: s. 7 –”sexual assault” –Words touch and physical contact – Interpretation of – Held: Both the said words “touch” and “physical contact”have been interchangeably used in s. 7 by the legislature – Word “touch” has been used specifically with regard to the sexual parts of the body, whereas the word “physical contact” has been used for any other act – Thus, the act of touching the sexual part of body or any other act involving physical contact, if done with “sexual intent” would amount to “sexual assault” within the meaning of s. 7 – Expression “sexual intent” having not been explained in s. 7, it cannot be confined to any predetermined format or structure and that it would be a question of fact – However, the expression ‘physical contact’ used in s. 7 cannot be construed as ‘skin to skin’ contact – Restricting the interpretation of the words “touch” or “physical contact” to “skin to skin contact” would not only be a narrow and pedantic interpretation of s. 7 but an absurd interpretation of s. 7 which would lead to a very detrimental situation, frustrating the very object of the Act inasmuch as in that case touching the sexual or non sexual parts of the body of a child with gloves, condoms, sheets or with cloth, though done with sexual intent would not amount to an offence of sexual assault u/s. 7– “Skin to skin contact” for constituting an offence of “sexual assault” could not have been intended or contemplated by the Legislature – Most important ingredient for constituting the offence of sexual assault u/s. 7 is “sexual intent” and not “skin to skin” contact with the child. ss. 7, 8 – Offence of sexual assault – Allegation against accused S that he lured a 12 year old girl to his house, and pressed her breast and tried to remove her salwar and when the victim tried to shout, the accused pressed her mouth – Special court convicted and sentenced the accused for offences u/ss. 342, 354 and 363 IPC and s. 8 – In appeal, the High Court acquitted the accused for the offence u/s. 8 and convicted him for the offence u/s. 342 and 354 IPC – On appeal, held: High Court erred in holding that the act of pressing of breast of the child aged 12 years in absence of any specific details as to whether the top was removed or whether he inserted his hands inside the top and pressed her breast, would not fall in the definition of sexual assault, but within the definition of offence u/s. 354 IPC; and that there was no offence since there was no direct physical contact- “skin to skin” with sexual intent – Whoever, with sexual intent touches the vagina, penis, anus or breast of the child or makes the child touch the vagina, penis, anus or breast of such person or any other person, would be committing an offence of “sexual assault” – Similarly, whoever does any other act with sexual intent which involves physical contact without penetration, would also be committing the offence of “sexual assault” u/s. 7 – Prosecution was not required to prove a “skin to skin” contact for proving the charge of sexual assault u/s. 7 – Allegation of sexual intent stood proved by the prosecution – All these acts were the acts of “sexual assault” as contemplated u/s. 7, punishable u/s. 8 –Thus, the order passed by the High Court set aside and that of the trial court restored. ss. 8 and 10 r/w s. 9(m) and 12 – Allegation against accused L that he went to the house of the victim aged 5 years when no one was there, and caught the hand of the victim, moved her frock upward with one hand and lowered her pant with the other hand, and thereafter, unzipped his pant and showed his penis to her and asked her to lay down on the cot – When the mother of the victim returned, she saw one person had caught the hand of the victim and also saw the victim raising her pant – Special Court convicted and sentenced the accused for offences punishable u/s. 448 and 354-A(1)(i) IPC and ss. 8 and 10 r/w s. 9(m) and 12 – High Court upheld the conviction u/ss. 448 and 354-A(1)(i) IPC rw s.12 of the POCSO, however, set aside the conviction u/ss. 8 and 10 and modified the sentence to the extent already undergone – On appeal, held: When the alleged acts of entering the house of the prosecutrix with sexual intent to outrage her modesty, of holding her hands and opening the zip of his pant showing his penis, are held to be established by the prosecution, there was no reason for the High Court not to treat such acts as the acts of “sexual assault” within the meaning of s. 7 – Accused-L committed an offence of “sexual assault” within the meaning of s. 7 and the prosecutrix being below the age of 12 years, he had committed an offence of “aggravated sexual assault” as contemplated u/s. 9(m), liable to be punished with the imprisonment for a term not less than five years u/s. 10 – Thus, the order passed by the High Court set aside and that of the trial court are restored. Enactment of the Act – Object and reasons – Stated. Interpretation of statutes: Duty of the Court – Held: Courts should ascertain the intention of the Legislature enacting it, and should accept an interpretation or construction which promotes the object of the legislation and prevents its possible abuse. Rule of construction contained in maxim “Ut Res Magis Valeat Quam Pereat” – Held: Construction of a rule should give effect to the rule rather than destroying it – Any narrow and pedantic interpretation of the provision which would defeat the object of the provision, cannot be accepted – Where the intention of the Legislature cannot be given effect to, the courts would accept the bolder construction for the purpose of bringing about an effective result - Maxim “Ut Res Magis Valeat Quam Pereat”. Penal statue – Construction of – Held: Penal Statute enacting an offence or imposing a penalty has to be strictly construed – Thus, POCSO must be strictly constructed – However, clauses of a statute should be construed with reference to the context vis-a-vis the other provisions so as to make a consistent enactment of the whole Statute relating to the subject matter – Thus, considering the objects of the POCSO Act, its provisions, more particularly pertaining to the sexual assault, sexual harassment etc. have to be construed vis-a-vis the other provisions, so as to make the objects of the Act more meaningful and effective – Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012. Rule of lenity – Invocation of – Held: Where the legislature has manifested its intention, courts may not manufacture ambiguity in order to defeat that intent – Court should not be over zealous in searching for ambiguities or obscurities in words which are plain –  As regards s.7 of the POCSO Act, the court did not find any ambiguity or obscurity so as to invoke the Rule of Lenity – Invocation of “Rule of lenity” was misconceived – Submission that the “Rule of Lenity” requires a court to resolve statutory ambiguity in a criminal statute in favour of the accused, or to strictly construe the statute against the State, cannot be accepted since the statutory ambiguity should be invoked as a last resort of interpretation – Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012. Principle of “ejusdem generis” – Application of – Held: Principle of “ejusdem generis” should be applied only as an aid to the construction of the statute – It should not be applied where it would defeat the very legislative intent – If the specific words used in the section exhaust a class, it has to be construed that the legislative intent was to use the general word beyond the class denoted by the specific words. Crime against women: Offence of sexual assault – “Skin to skin contact” if, required to constitute an offence of sexual assault – Interpretation of expression “touch” and “sexual assault” – Analogous provisions as prevalent in foreign countries – Discussed. Words and phrases: Touch and physical contact, in the context of s. 7 of the POCSO Act – Meaning of – Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012 – s. 7. Practice and procedure:Certified copies of the judgments/ orders – Proper procedure for preparing the certified copies – Need for.",

        "HeadNote": "Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012: s. 7 –”sexual assault” –Words touch and physical contact – Interpretation of – Held: Both the said words “touch” and “physical contact”have been interchangeably used in s. 7 by the legislature – Word “touch” has been used specifically with regard to the sexual parts of the body, whereas the word “physical contact” has been used for any other act – Thus, the act of touching the sexual part of body or any other act involving physical contact, if done with “sexual intent” would amount to “sexual assault” within the meaning of s. 7 – Expression “sexual intent” having not been explained in s. 7, it cannot be confined to any predetermined format or structure and that it would be a question of fact – However, the expression ‘physical contact’ used in s. 7 cannot be construed as ‘skin to skin’ contact – Restricting the interpretation of the words “touch” or “physical contact” to “skin to skin contact” would not only be a narrow and pedantic interpretation of s. 7 but an absurd interpretation of s. 7 which would lead to a very detrimental situation, frustrating the very object of the Act inasmuch as in that case touching the sexual or non sexual parts of the body of a child with gloves, condoms, sheets or with cloth, though done with sexual intent would not amount to an offence of sexual assault u/s. 7– “Skin to skin contact” for constituting an offence of “sexual assault” could not have been intended or contemplated by the Legislature – Most important ingredient for constituting the offence of sexual assault u/s. 7 is “sexual intent” and not “skin to skin” contact with the child. ss. 7, 8 – Offence of sexual assault – Allegation against accused S that he lured a 12 year old girl to his house, and pressed her breast and tried to remove her salwar and when the victim tried to shout, the accused pressed her mouth – Special court convicted and sentenced the accused for offences u/ss. 342, 354 and 363 IPC and s. 8 – In appeal, the High Court acquitted the accused for the offence u/s. 8 and convicted him for the offence u/s. 342 and 354 IPC – On appeal, held: High Court erred in holding that the act of pressing of breast of the child aged 12 years in absence of any specific details as to whether the top was removed or whether he inserted his hands inside the top and pressed her breast, would not fall in the definition of sexual assault, but within the definition of offence u/s. 354 IPC; and that there was no offence since there was no direct physical contact- “skin to skin” with sexual intent – Whoever, with sexual intent touches the vagina, penis, anus or breast of the child or makes the child touch the vagina, penis, anus or breast of such person or any other person, would be committing an offence of “sexual assault” – Similarly, whoever does any other act with sexual intent which involves physical contact without penetration, would also be committing the offence of “sexual assault” u/s. 7 – Prosecution was not required to prove a “skin to skin” contact for proving the charge of sexual assault u/s. 7 – Allegation of sexual intent stood proved by the prosecution – All these acts were the acts of “sexual assault” as contemplated u/s. 7, punishable u/s. 8 –Thus, the order passed by the High Court set aside and that of the trial court restored. ss. 8 and 10 r/w s. 9(m) and 12 – Allegation against accused L that he went to the house of the victim aged 5 years when no one was there, and caught the hand of the victim, moved her frock upward with one hand and lowered her pant with the other hand, and thereafter, unzipped his pant and showed his penis to her and asked her to lay down on the cot – When the mother of the victim returned, she saw one person had caught the hand of the victim and also saw the victim raising her pant – Special Court convicted and sentenced the accused for offences punishable u/s. 448 and 354-A(1)(i) IPC and ss. 8 and 10 r/w s. 9(m) and 12 – High Court upheld the conviction u/ss. 448 and 354-A(1)(i) IPC rw s.12 of the POCSO, however, set aside the conviction u/ss. 8 and 10 and modified the sentence to the extent already undergone – On appeal, held: When the alleged acts of entering the house of the prosecutrix with sexual intent to outrage her modesty, of holding her hands and opening the zip of his pant showing his penis, are held to be established by the prosecution, there was no reason for the High Court not to treat such acts as the acts of “sexual assault” within the meaning of s. 7 – Accused-L committed an offence of “sexual assault” within the meaning of s. 7 and the prosecutrix being below the age of 12 years, he had committed an offence of “aggravated sexual assault” as contemplated u/s. 9(m), liable to be punished with the imprisonment for a term not less than five years u/s. 10 – Thus, the order passed by the High Court set aside and that of the trial court are restored. Enactment of the Act – Object and reasons – Stated. Interpretation of statutes: Duty of the Court – Held: Courts should ascertain the intention of the Legislature enacting it, and should accept an interpretation or construction which promotes the object of the legislation and prevents its possible abuse. Rule of construction contained in maxim “Ut Res Magis Valeat Quam Pereat” – Held: Construction of a rule should give effect to the rule rather than destroying it – Any narrow and pedantic interpretation of the provision which would defeat the object of the provision, cannot be accepted – Where the intention of the Legislature cannot be given effect to, the courts would accept the bolder construction for the purpose of bringing about an effective result - Maxim “Ut Res Magis Valeat Quam Pereat”. Penal statue – Construction of – Held: Penal Statute enacting an offence or imposing a penalty has to be strictly construed – Thus, POCSO must be strictly constructed – However, clauses of a statute should be construed with reference to the context vis-a-vis the other provisions so as to make a consistent enactment of the whole Statute relating to the subject matter – Thus, considering the objects of the POCSO Act, its provisions, more particularly pertaining to the sexual assault, sexual harassment etc. have to be construed vis-a-vis the other provisions, so as to make the objects of the Act more meaningful and effective – Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012. Rule of lenity – Invocation of – Held: Where the legislature has manifested its intention, courts may not manufacture ambiguity in order to defeat that intent – Court should not be over zealous in searching for ambiguities or obscurities in words which are plain –  As regards s.7 of the POCSO Act, the court did not find any ambiguity or obscurity so as to invoke the Rule of Lenity – Invocation of “Rule of lenity” was misconceived – Submission that the “Rule of Lenity” requires a court to resolve statutory ambiguity in a criminal statute in favour of the accused, or to strictly construe the statute against the State, cannot be accepted since the statutory ambiguity should be invoked as a last resort of interpretation – Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012. Principle of “ejusdem generis” – Application of – Held: Principle of “ejusdem generis” should be applied only as an aid to the construction of the statute – It should not be applied where it would defeat the very legislative intent – If the specific words used in the section exhaust a class, it has to be construed that the legislative intent was to use the general word beyond the class denoted by the specific words. Crime against women: Offence of sexual assault – “Skin to skin contact” if, required to constitute an offence of sexual assault – Interpretation of expression “touch” and “sexual assault” – Analogous provisions as prevalent in foreign countries – Discussed. Words and phrases: Touch and physical contact, in the context of s. 7 of the POCSO Act – Meaning of – Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012 – s. 7.

        "HeadNote": "Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012: s. 7 –”sexual assault” –Words touch and physical contact – Interpretation of – Held: Both the said words “touch” and “physical contact”have been interchangeably used in s. 7 by the legislature – Word “touch” has been used specifically with regard to the sexual parts of the body, whereas the word “physical contact” has been used for any other act – Thus, the act of touching the sexual part of body or any other act involving physical contact, if done with “sexual intent” would amount to “sexual assault” within the meaning of s. 7 – Expression “sexual intent” having not been explained in s. 7, it cannot be confined to any predetermined format or structure and that it would be a question of fact – However, the expression ‘physical contact’ used in s. 7 cannot be construed as ‘skin to skin’ contact – Restricting the interpretation of the words “touch” or “physical contact” to “skin to skin contact” would not only be a narrow and pedantic interpretation of s. 7 but an absurd interpretation of s. 7 which would lead to a very detrimental situation, frustrating the very object of the Act inasmuch as in that case touching the sexual or non sexual parts of the body of a child with gloves, condoms, sheets or with cloth, though done with sexual intent would not amount to an offence of sexual assault u/s. 7– “Skin to skin contact” for constituting an offence of “sexual assault” could not have been intended or contemplated by the Legislature – Most important ingredient for constituting the offence of sexual assault u/s. 7 is “sexual intent” and not “skin to skin” contact with the child. ss. 7, 8 – Offence of sexual assault – Allegation against accused S that he lured a 12 year old girl to his house, and pressed her breast and tried to remove her salwar and when the victim tried to shout, the accused pressed her mouth – Special court convicted and sentenced the accused for offences u/ss. 342, 354 and 363 IPC and s. 8 – In appeal, the High Court acquitted the accused for the offence u/s. 8 and convicted him for the offence u/s. 342 and 354 IPC – On appeal, held: High Court erred in holding that the act of pressing of breast of the child aged 12 years in absence of any specific details as to whether the top was removed or whether he inserted his hands inside the top and pressed her breast, would not fall in the definition of sexual assault, but within the definition of offence u/s. 354 IPC; and that there was no offence since there was no direct physical contact- “skin to skin” with sexual intent – Whoever, with sexual intent touches the vagina, penis, anus or breast of the child or makes the child touch the vagina, penis, anus or breast of such person or any other person, would be committing an offence of “sexual assault” – Similarly, whoever does any other act with sexual intent which involves physical contact without penetration, would also be committing the offence of “sexual assault” u/s. 7 – Prosecution was not required to prove a “skin to skin” contact for proving the charge of sexual assault u/s. 7 – Allegation of sexual intent stood proved by the prosecution – All these acts were the acts of “sexual assault” as contemplated u/s. 7, punishable u/s. 8 –Thus, the order passed by the High Court set aside and that of the trial court restored. ss. 8 and 10 r/w s. 9(m) and 12 – Allegation against accused L that he went to the house of the victim aged 5 years when no one was there, and caught the hand of the victim, moved her frock upward with one hand and lowered her pant with the other hand, and thereafter, unzipped his pant and showed his penis to her and asked her to lay down on the cot – When the mother of the victim returned, she saw one person had caught the hand of the victim and also saw the victim raising her pant – Special Court convicted and sentenced the accused for offences punishable u/s. 448 and 354-A(1)(i) IPC and ss. 8 and 10 r/w s. 9(m) and 12 – High Court upheld the conviction u/ss. 448 and 354-A(1)(i) IPC rw s.12 of the POCSO, however, set aside the conviction u/ss. 8 and 10 and modified the sentence to the extent already undergone – On appeal, held: When the alleged acts of entering the house of the prosecutrix with sexual intent to outrage her modesty, of holding her hands and opening the zip of his pant showing his penis, are held to be established by the prosecution, there was no reason for the High Court not to treat such acts as the acts of “sexual assault” within the meaning of s. 7 – Accused-L committed an offence of “sexual assault” within the meaning of s. 7 and the prosecutrix being below the age of 12 years, he had committed an offence of “aggravated sexual assault” as contemplated u/s. 9(m), liable to be punished with the imprisonment for a term not less than five years u/s. 10 – Thus, the order passed by the High Court set aside and that of the trial court are restored. Enactment of the Act – Object and reasons – Stated. Interpretation of statutes: Duty of the Court – Held: Courts should ascertain the intention of the Legislature enacting it, and should accept an interpretation or construction which promotes the object of the legislation and prevents its possible abuse. Rule of construction contained in maxim “Ut Res Magis Valeat Quam Pereat” – Held: Construction of a rule should give effect to the rule rather than destroying it – Any narrow and pedantic interpretation of the provision which would defeat the object of the provision, cannot be accepted – Where the intention of the Legislature cannot be given effect to, the courts would accept the bolder construction for the purpose of bringing about an effective result - Maxim “Ut Res Magis Valeat Quam Pereat”. Penal statue – Construction of – Held: Penal Statute enacting an offence or imposing a penalty has to be strictly construed – Thus, POCSO must be strictly constructed – However, clauses of a statute should be construed with reference to the context vis-a-vis the other provisions so as to make a consistent enactment of the whole Statute relating to the subject matter – Thus, considering the objects of the POCSO Act, its provisions, more particularly pertaining to the sexual assault, sexual harassment etc. have to be construed vis-a-vis the other provisions, so as to make the objects of the Act more meaningful and effective – Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012. Rule of lenity – Invocation of – Held: Where the legislature has manifested its intention, courts may not manufacture ambiguity in order to defeat that intent – Court should not be over zealous in searching for ambiguities or obscurities in words which are plain –  As regards s.7 of the POCSO Act, the court did not find any ambiguity or obscurity so as to invoke the Rule of Lenity – Invocation of “Rule of lenity” was misconceived – Submission that the “Rule of Lenity” requires a court to resolve statutory ambiguity in a criminal statute in favour of the accused, or to strictly construe the statute against the State, cannot be accepted since the statutory ambiguity should be invoked as a last resort of interpretation – Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012. Principle of “ejusdem generis” – Application of – Held: Principle of “ejusdem generis” should be applied only as an aid to the construction of the statute – It should not be applied where it would defeat the very legislative intent – If the specific words used in the section exhaust a class, it has to be construed that the legislative intent was to use the general word beyond the class denoted by the specific words. Crime against women: Offence of sexual assault – “Skin to skin contact” if, required to constitute an offence of sexual assault – Interpretation of expression “touch” and “sexual assault” – Analogous provisions as prevalent in foreign countries – Discussed. Words and phrases: Touch and physical contact, in the context of s. 7 of the POCSO Act – Meaning of – Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012 – s. 7.
