FIR: A cryptic phone call without complete information or containing part-information about the commission of a cognizable offence cannot always be treated as an FIR – A mere message or a telephonic message which does not clearly specify the offence, cannot be treated as an FIR – In the instant case, the intimation given by two individuals merely set out the bare facts of an attack; the information was incomplete; neither the name of the victim nor the names of the alleged attackers nor even the precise location where the incident occurred were mentioned – High Court, in the appeal before it, correctly inferred that the first information recorded at 17.45 hrs could not be treated as an FIR – In these circumstances, the details of the event which occurred, the nature of the attack, the place of the attack, the names and identities of the accused were set out fully when PW-1 recorded the statement at 23.45 hrs that constitutes the FIR.",

        "HeadNote": "Penal Code, 1860: s.302 r/w s.34 – Prosecution case was that on the fateful day, at 17:30, accused persons in furtherance of their common intention assaulted the victim-deceased and inflicted serious injuries with a sword as well as by fists blows and kicks – At 17:45, police received telephone information regarding the incident – Around 19:15, deceased succumbed to injuries in hospital – Based on the complaint of PW-1, FIR was registered at 23:45 pm at police station alleging involvement of appellants-accused and one absconding person – Trial court convicted A-2 – It, however found evidence against A-1 and A-3 doubtful and acquitted them – Trial court treated the information received at 17.45 hours as a first information and discarded FIR recorded later during the night at 23:45 – It rejected the argument of accused that the eye witnesses were partisan and hence unreliable, yet based predominantly on medical evidence which read as negative in the role of A-1 and A-3 – Trial court acquitted them of charges levelled holding that in the absence of injuries of the kind attributed to these accused no finding of their culpability to warrant conviction was returned – As regards A-2, trial court held him guilty on account of his participation with absconding accused, with whom he moved away on motorcycle – High Court reversed acquittal of A-1 and A-3 and also affirmed conviction of A-2 – Hence instant appeal – Held: The consistent testimony of all the eyewitnesses was that the appellants were part of the attack; they played an active role in assaulting the deceased and chasing him, which eventually forced him to run into PW-5’s shop and collapse there – The material objects recovered from the site as well as PW-5’s shop which included bloodstains clearly supported the story of these eyewitnesses – The evidence i.e. the exhortation by these accused, their active role in attacking the deceased, chasing him and leaving the crime scene together, clinchedthat there was a consensus of the minds of persons participating in the criminal action to bring about a particular result – It was this aspect which the trial court glaringly overlooked, and instead, misdirected itself grossly in focusing upon the first intimation, treating it as the FIR, and therefore, proceeding to doubt the prosecution version – The eyewitness testimonies which clearly implicated them in the crime, established their participation, and the depositions which showed that they played a part in achieving the common intention of carrying the murderous assault on the deceased was overlooked by the trial court for trivial and immaterial reasons – High Court correctly reversed the acquittal, and recorded the conviction against all the appellants. FIR: A cryptic phone call without complete information or containing part-information about the commission of a cognizable offence cannot always be treated as an FIR – A mere message or a telephonic message which does not clearly specify the offence, cannot be treated as an FIR – In the instant case, the intimation given by two individuals merely set out the bare facts of an attack; the information was incomplete; neither the name of the victim nor the names of the alleged attackers nor even the precise location where the incident occurred were mentioned – High Court, in the appeal before it, correctly inferred that the first information recorded at 17.45 hrs could not be treated as an FIR – In these circumstances, the details of the event which occurred, the nature of the attack, the place of the attack, the names and identities of the accused were set out fully when PW-1 recorded the statement at 23.45 hrs that constitutes the FIR.",

        "HeadNote": "Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 – s.7 – Some original lenders of the corporate debtor, assigned the debts owed to them by the corporate debtor to the appellant – Appellant took actual physical possession of project assets of the corporate debtor under the SARFAESI Act and filed application u/s.7 of IBC before the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) for default from the corporate debtor – As the relevant form indicating the date of default did not indicate any such date, this was subsequently made up by the appellant by filing a supplementary affidavit before the NCLT, specifically mentioning the date of default and annexing copies of balance sheets of the corporate debtor, which, according to the appellant, acknowledged periodically the debt that was due – NCLT admitted the s.7 application, observing that balance sheets of the corporate debtor, wherein it acknowledged its liability, were signed before expiry of three years from the date of default, and entries in such balance sheets being acknowledgements of the debt due for purposes of s.18 of the Limitation Act, the s.7 application was not barred by limitation – Whether entries in balance sheets of a corporate debtor would amount to acknowledgement of debt for purpose of extending limitation u/s.18 of the Limitation Act – Held: An entry made in the books of accounts, including the balance sheet, can amount to an acknowledgement of liability within the meaning of s.18 of the Limitation Act – Though the filing of a balance sheet is by compulsion of law, the acknowledgement of a debt is not necessarily so – Provisions of the Companies Act show that filing of a balance sheet in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act is mandatory, any transgression of the same being punishable by law – However, what is of importance is that notes that are annexed to or forming part of such financial statements are expressly recognised by s.134(7) – Equally, the auditor’s report may also enter caveats with regard to acknowledgements made in the books of accounts including the balance sheet – Thus, there is a compulsion in law to prepare a balance sheet but no compulsion to make any particular admission, as it would depend on the facts of each case as to whether an entry made in a balance sheet qua any particular creditor is unequivocal or has been entered into with caveats, which then has to be examined on a case by case basis to establish whether an acknowledgement of liability has, in fact, been made, thereby extending limitation u/s.18 of the Limitation Act – Limitation Act, 1963 – s.18 – Companies Act, 2013 – ss.2(40), 90, 128, 129, 134 and 137 – Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Securities Interest Act, 2002. Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 – s.238A – Whether s.18 of the Limitation Act, which extends the period of limitation depending upon an acknowledgement of debt made in writing and signed by the corporate debtor, is also applicable under s.238A, given the expression “as far as may be” governing the applicability of the Limitation Act to the IBC – Held: The aforesaid question is no longer res integra as two recent judgments of this Court have applied the provisions of s.14 and s.18 of the Limitation Act to the IBC – Limitation Act, 1963 – s.18. Limitation Act, 1963 – s.9 – Principle of s.9 of the Limitation Act is to be strictly adhered to, namely, that when time begins to run, it cannot be halted, except by a process known to law. Precedents – Binding precedent – Rule of stare decisis – Every argumentative novelty does not undo a settled position of law – Constitution of India – Art. 141.",

State of Haryana assessed the market value in respect of lands from villages Naharpur Kasan, Kasan, Bas Kusla, Bas Haria, and Dhana (covered by Phases II and III) at Rs.41.40 lakhs per acre; while compensation for lands from village Manesar (covered by Phase IV) was assessed at Rs.62.10 lakhs per acre – Appeals arising therefrom were decided by this Court vide its Judgment dated 11.01.2019 as modified by Order dated 08.02.2019 in Wazir and Another vs. State of Haryana i.e., after the decision of the High Court which is presently under appeal – The decision of the High Court in HSIIDC v. Roshan Lal and others, which was the basis of the decision in the present matters, had in turn relied upon the assessment made by the High Court in its earlier in Madan Pal III – Since the assessment in Madan Pal III was scaled down by this Court in Wazir and Another v. State of Haryana, theoretically, the market value arrived at by the High Court in Roshan Lal case would be on the higher side – The acquisition in Roshan Lal case was a year before the present acquisition – If the lands in both cases were otherwise identical in material terms, the valuation found with respect to the former in the year 2004, must have undergone some upward change when the valuation of the latter set of lands is to be considered for the year 2005 – Although, the decision in Roshan Lal was not challenged by the State, the fact remains that the values assessed in that decision were theoretically on a higher scale and the landholders, on that score, have received an advantage – In totality of circumstances, the landholders must be held entitled to 8% flat increase over the market value assessed in HSIIDC v. Roshan Lal and others in respect of lands from villages which were found to be comparable – The landholders must therefore get enhancement to the tune of 8% over Rs.43.61 lakhs per acre – They shall also be entitled to all the statutory benefits.",

Customs Act, 1962: s.28(4) – Power to review – The nature of the power to recover the duty, not paid or short paid after the goods have been assessed and cleared for import, is broadly a power to review the earlier decision of assessment – Such a power is not inherent in any authority – The power has been so conferred specifically on “the proper officer” which must necessarily mean the proper officer who, in the first instance, assessed and cleared the goods – It is completely impermissible to allow an officer, who has not passed the original order of assessment, to re-open the assessment on the grounds that the duty was not paid/not levied, by the original officer who had decided to clear the goods and who was competent and authorised to make the assessment – The nature of the power conferred by s.28(4) to recover duties which have escaped assessment is in the nature of an administrative review of an act – The section must, therefore, be construed as conferring the power of such review on the same officer or his successor or any other officer who has been assigned the function of assessment – In other words, an officer who did the assessment, could only undertake re-assessment – It is, therefore, clear that the Additional Director General of DRI was not “the” proper officer to exercise the power under s.28(4) and the initiation of the recovery proceedings in this case is without any jurisdiction and liable to be set aside – Tax/Taxation.Customs Act, 1962: s.6 – Import of cameras – Deputy Commissioner of Customs checked the goods and took a decision to clear the goods as being exempt from duty – Show cause notice issued under s.28(4) by Additional Director General, Directorate of Revenue Intelligence alleging that the Customs Authorities had been induced to clear the cameras by wilful mis-statement and suppression of facts about the cameras – Whether the Additional Director General of the DRI was even a proper officer – Held: The Additional Director General can be considered to be a proper officer only if it is shown that he was a Customs officer under the Customs Act – It is obvious that the re-assessment and recovery of duties i.e. contemplated by s.28(4) is by the same authority and not by any superior authority such as Appellate or Revisional Authority – It is, therefore, clear that the Additional Director General of DRI was not “the” proper officer to exercise the power under s.28(4) – If it was intended that officers of the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence who are officers of Central Government should be entrusted with functions of the Customs officers, it was imperative that the Central Government should have done so in exercise of its power under s.6 of the Act – The entire proceeding in the present case initiated by the Additional Director General of the DRI by issuing show cause notices in all the matters are invalid without any authority of law and liable to be set-aside and the ensuing demands are also set- aside. Customs Act, 1962: s.28(4) – Limitation – Suppression of facts – Invocation of extended period of limitation – Held: On facts, importer had asked for a first check and had shown the cameras along with Bill of Entry and literature detailing specifications of models – The custom authorities could have operated the cameras to see the length of time of the single sequence and whether recording of the single sequence exhausted the total memory of the camera (including extended memory) and whether the cameras were eligible for exemption – In such circumstances, it cannot be said that there was any wilful mis-statement of facts – It must, therefore, follow that the extended period of limitation of five years was not available to any authority to re-open under s.28(4). Interpretation of statutes: It is well known that when a statute directs that the things be done in a certain way, it must be done in that way alone – Customs Act, 1962 – s.28(4).

Customs Act, 1962: s.28(4) – Power to review – The nature of the power to recover the duty, not paid or short paid after the goods have been assessed and cleared for import, is broadly a power to review the earlier decision of assessment – Such a power is not inherent in any authority – The power has been so conferred specifically on “the proper officer” which must necessarily mean the proper officer who, in the first instance, assessed and cleared the goods – It is completely impermissible to allow an officer, who has not passed the original order of assessment, to re-open the assessment on the grounds that the duty was not paid/not levied, by the original officer who had decided to clear the goods and who was competent and authorised to make the assessment – The nature of the power conferred by s.28(4) to recover duties which have escaped assessment is in the nature of an administrative review of an act – The section must, therefore, be construed as conferring the power of such review on the same officer or his successor or any other officer who has been assigned the function of assessment – In other words, an officer who did the assessment, could only undertake re-assessment – It is, therefore, clear that the Additional Director General of DRI was not “the” proper officer to exercise the power under s.28(4) and the initiation of the recovery proceedings in this case is without any jurisdiction and liable to be set aside – Tax/Taxation.Customs Act, 1962: s.6 – Import of cameras – Deputy Commissioner of Customs checked the goods and took a decision to clear the goods as being exempt from duty – Show cause notice issued under s.28(4) by Additional Director General, Directorate of Revenue Intelligence alleging that the Customs Authorities had been induced to clear the cameras by wilful mis-statement and suppression of facts about the cameras – Whether the Additional Director General of the DRI was even a proper officer – Held: The Additional Director General can be considered to be a proper officer only if it is shown that he was a Customs officer under the Customs Act – It is obvious that the re-assessment and recovery of duties i.e. contemplated by s.28(4) is by the same authority and not by any superior authority such as Appellate or Revisional Authority – It is, therefore, clear that the Additional Director General of DRI was not “the” proper officer to exercise the power under s.28(4) – If it was intended that officers of the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence who are officers of Central Government should be entrusted with functions of the Customs officers, it was imperative that the Central Government should have done so in exercise of its power under s.6 of the Act – The entire proceeding in the present case initiated by the Additional Director General of the DRI by issuing show cause notices in all the matters are invalid without any authority of law and liable to be set-aside and the ensuing demands are also set- aside. Customs Act, 1962: s.28(4) – Limitation – Suppression of facts – Invocation of extended period of limitation – Held: On facts, importer had asked for a first check and had shown the cameras along with Bill of Entry and literature detailing specifications of models – The custom authorities could have operated the cameras to see the length of time of the single sequence and whether recording of the single sequence exhausted the total memory of the camera (including extended memory) and whether the cameras were eligible for exemption – In such circumstances, it cannot be said that there was any wilful mis-statement of facts – It must, therefore, follow that the extended period of limitation of five years was not available to any authority to re-open under s.28(4).

Customs Act, 1962: s.2(26) – Importer, who is – Sale on High Seas – Appellant’s case was that there was a quadripartite agreement whereby the supplier sold the goods in question to the first-buyer and delivered them at the port of shipment – Thereafter, while the goods were on high seas, first buyer transferred them to the appellant by endorsing the bill of lading in favour of the appellant – Further to this and while the goods were yet on high seas, appellant allegedly transferred them to the end-buyer by endorsing the bill of lading in favour of the end-buyer – Appellant also suggested that since the end-buyer did not have ‘the requisite infrastructure’ to undertake importation of goods whereas the appellant had the requisite infrastructure for importation, therefore, appellant was to act as an agent of the end-buyer and to clear the goods from customs authorities – Held: The inclusive definition of “importer” in s.2(26)of the Customs Act cannot be used to usurp the identity of an importer from the person who filed the bill of entry; and the person in whose name the bill of entry is filed, does not cease to be an importer – In this case, the name of the appellant was reflected as importer in the Import General Manifest (IGM) of the vessel/s that brought the goods in question to the port at Visakhapatnam – High Court observed that if the alleged second high seas sale had taken place, the IGM would have reflected the name of the last high seas sale purchaser as the importer and if there was any bonafide omission, the IGM would have necessitated amendment because only the last purchaser of the goods on high seas could have been the importer/consignee – It is but apparent that that while bringing anything into India from a place outside India is generally regarded as “import” but, when the goods are cleared for home consumption, they are no longer imported goods for the purpose of the Customs Act – Significantly, in the process of importation, the importer, in relation to any goods, includes any owner or any other person holding himself to be the importer but, only between the time of their importation and their clearance for home consumption – In other words, the net result of the expanded definition of the expression “importer” is that while any person who imports goods into India would be an importer but, the owner of the goods or a person holding himself to be an importer would also be regarded as an importer during the period between importation of goods and their clearance for home consumption – This crucial period would generally be that period when the goods have been warehoused after importation and are cleared from warehouse by a person other than the person who actually imported the goods – That being the position, High Court rightly held that this definition of importer cannot be used to usurp the identity of an importer from the person who filed the bill of entry – In other words, the person in whose name the bill of entry is filed does not cease to be an importer and, if that person claims to be not the owner or importer, the onus would be heavy on him to establish that someone else is the owner or importer of goods – Further, if the appellant was merely acting as an agent, then bill of entry would have reflected the name of end-buyer as the importer and the appellant as an agent of the importer; and further to that, the said end-buyer would have been assessed for customs duty – It was not so – Thus, when all official documents as also dealings of the appellant clearly establish that the appellant had been the importer, the consequences are bound to follow – It gets perforce reiterated that when the bills of entry recorded the name of the appellant as importer and the appellant alone was assessed to customs duty, the so called second high seas sale agreements never came into operation – Central Sales Tax Act, 1956 – s.5(2). Central Sales Tax Act, 1956: s.5(2) – Claim for exemption under – Raising of debit notes by the appellant on the end-buyers – Effect of – Inter State Sales – Appellant had admittedly raised debit notes on the end-buyers but only after having cleared the goods by filing the bill of entry for home consumption – Once the suggestion about the second high seas sales is not accepted and it is found that the appellant had been the importer of goods and had cleared them for home consumption, the natural consequence of raising of such debit notes on the end-buyers situated in different States and movement of goods to such end-buyers would be to take these transactions in the category of inter-State sales in terms of s.3(a) of the CST Act – Appellant was not entitled to the exemption of s.5(2) of the CST Act and rightly been held liable for tax over inter-State sales – After the appellant got the goods released by filing bill of entry for home consumption, indisputably, the goods were ultimately received by various end-buyers in different States and appellant raised debit notes from the State of Andhra Pradesh – These facts were sufficient to establish that the movement of goods inside the country from one State to another had been on account of the sale by appellant to the end-buyers; and such sales took place only after the appellant obtained the goods from the bonded warehouse for home consumption – High Court was right in observing that once the appellant got released the goods after filing the bill of entry for home consumption, the import stream dried up and the goods got mixed in the local goods – Any movement of the goods thereafter was bound to be a sale under s.3(a) of the CST Act; and such movement being from the State of Andhra Pradesh to other State, it had been a matter of inter-State sale – The principle that actual sale may not necessarily precede the movement of goods, in its true effect, operates rather against the appellant in relation to the sale to end-buyers after the goods were cleared for home consumption – The claimed exemption under s.5(2) of the CST Act was rightly denied to the appellant and the High Court was justified in dismissing the writ petitions filed by the appellant – No case for interference is made out. Central Sales Tax Act, 1956: s.5(2) – Whether any case for relegating the appellant to the remedy of appeal made out – Appellant, despite being aware of the availability of remedy of statutory appeal, consciously chose to file writ petitions against the assessment orders and consciously contested the entire matter in the High Court – High Court, even after noticing the framework of certiorari jurisdiction, examined the merits of the case thoroughly and even examined the submission made for the first time in writ petitions that the import of goods was occasioned by the sales in question – Of course, in that regard, the High Court pointed out that it was not a pure question of law but in any case, such submission was belied by the fact that the name of the appellant was reflected in the bill of entry as the importer and not that of the end-buyer – There is no error or fault in the approach of High Court in this case – After having consciously invoked the writ jurisdiction of the High Court and having contested the matter on merits, the appellant cannot now be allowed to re-open the matter in appeal – The extraordinary writ jurisdiction cannot be utilised by a litigant only to take chance and then to seek recourse to the other remedy after failing in its attempt on the basic merits of the case before the High Court – A litigation cannot be allowed to be unendingly kept alive at the choice of a litigant – Writ jurisdiction.",

Customs Act, 1962: s.2(26) – Importer, who is – Sale on High Seas – Appellant’s case was that there was a quadripartite agreement whereby the supplier sold the goods in question to the first-buyer and delivered them at the port of shipment – Thereafter, while the goods were on high seas, first buyer transferred them to the appellant by endorsing the bill of lading in favour of the appellant – Further to this and while the goods were yet on high seas, appellant allegedly transferred them to the end-buyer by endorsing the bill of lading in favour of the end-buyer – Appellant also suggested that since the end-buyer did not have ‘the requisite infrastructure’ to undertake importation of goods whereas the appellant had the requisite infrastructure for importation, therefore, appellant was to act as an agent of the end-buyer and to clear the goods from customs authorities – Held: The inclusive definition of “importer” in s.2(26)of the Customs Act cannot be used to usurp the identity of an importer from the person who filed the bill of entry; and the person in whose name the bill of entry is filed, does not cease to be an importer – In this case, the name of the appellant was reflected as importer in the Import General Manifest (IGM) of the vessel/s that brought the goods in question to the port at Visakhapatnam – High Court observed that if the alleged second high seas sale had taken place, the IGM would have reflected the name of the last high seas sale purchaser as the importer and if there was any bonafide omission, the IGM would have necessitated amendment because only the last purchaser of the goods on high seas could have been the importer/consignee – It is but apparent that that while bringing anything into India from a place outside India is generally regarded as “import” but, when the goods are cleared for home consumption, they are no longer imported goods for the purpose of the Customs Act – Significantly, in the process of importation, the importer, in relation to any goods, includes any owner or any other person holding himself to be the importer but, only between the time of their importation and their clearance for home consumption – In other words, the net result of the expanded definition of the expression “importer” is that while any person who imports goods into India would be an importer but, the owner of the goods or a person holding himself to be an importer would also be regarded as an importer during the period between importation of goods and their clearance for home consumption – This crucial period would generally be that period when the goods have been warehoused after importation and are cleared from warehouse by a person other than the person who actually imported the goods – That being the position, High Court rightly held that this definition of importer cannot be used to usurp the identity of an importer from the person who filed the bill of entry – In other words, the person in whose name the bill of entry is filed does not cease to be an importer and, if that person claims to be not the owner or importer, the onus would be heavy on him to establish that someone else is the owner or importer of goods – Further, if the appellant was merely acting as an agent, then bill of entry would have reflected the name of end-buyer as the importer and the appellant as an agent of the importer; and further to that, the said end-buyer would have been assessed for customs duty – It was not so – Thus, when all official documents as also dealings of the appellant clearly establish that the appellant had been the importer, the consequences are bound to follow – It gets perforce reiterated that when the bills of entry recorded the name of the appellant as importer and the appellant alone was assessed to customs duty, the so called second high seas sale agreements never came into operation – Central Sales Tax Act, 1956 – s.5(2). Central Sales Tax Act, 1956: s.5(2) – Claim for exemption under – Raising of debit notes by the appellant on the end-buyers – Effect of – Inter State Sales – Appellant had admittedly raised debit notes on the end-buyers but only after having cleared the goods by filing the bill of entry for home consumption – Once the suggestion about the second high seas sales is not accepted and it is found that the appellant had been the importer of goods and had cleared them for home consumption, the natural consequence of raising of such debit notes on the end-buyers situated in different States and movement of goods to such end-buyers would be to take these transactions in the category of inter-State sales in terms of s.3(a) of the CST Act – Appellant was not entitled to the exemption of s.5(2) of the CST Act and rightly been held liable for tax over inter-State sales – After the appellant got the goods released by filing bill of entry for home consumption, indisputably, the goods were ultimately received by various end-buyers in different States and appellant raised debit notes from the State of Andhra Pradesh – These facts were sufficient to establish that the movement of goods inside the country from one State to another had been on account of the sale by appellant to the end-buyers; and such sales took place only after the appellant obtained the goods from the bonded warehouse for home consumption – High Court was right in observing that once the appellant got released the goods after filing the bill of entry for home consumption, the import stream dried up and the goods got mixed in the local goods – Any movement of the goods thereafter was bound to be a sale under s.3(a) of the CST Act; and such movement being from the State of Andhra Pradesh to other State, it had been a matter of inter-State sale – The principle that actual sale may not necessarily precede the movement of goods, in its true effect, operates rather against the appellant in relation to the sale to end-buyers after the goods were cleared for home consumption – The claimed exemption under s.5(2) of the CST Act was rightly denied to the appellant and the High Court was justified in dismissing the writ petitions filed by the appellant – No case for interference is made out. Central Sales Tax Act, 1956: s.5(2) – Whether any case for relegating the appellant to the remedy of appeal made out – Appellant, despite being aware of the availability of remedy of statutory appeal, consciously chose to file writ petitions against the assessment orders and consciously contested the entire matter in the High Court – High Court, even after noticing the framework of certiorari jurisdiction, examined the merits of the case thoroughly and even examined the submission made for the first time in writ petitions that the import of goods was occasioned by the sales in question – Of course, in that regard, the High Court pointed out that it was not a pure question of law but in any case, such submission was belied by the fact that the name of the appellant was reflected in the bill of entry as the importer and not that of the end-buyer – There is no error or fault in the approach of High Court in this case – After having consciously invoked the writ jurisdiction of the High Court and having contested the matter on merits, the appellant cannot now be allowed to re-open the matter in appeal – The extraordinary writ jurisdiction cannot be utilised by a litigant only to take chance and then to seek recourse to the other remedy after failing in its attempt on the basic merits of the case before the High Court – A litigation cannot be allowed to be unendingly kept alive at the choice of a litigant – Writ jurisdiction.",

Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 – Whether once a resolution plan is accepted, the corporate debtor is discharged of liability; and as a consequence, the guarantor whose liability is co-extensive with the principal debtor, i.e. the corporate debtor, too is discharged of all liabilities – Held: Approval of a resolution plan relating to a corporate debtor does not ipso facto discharge a personal guarantor (of the corporate debtor) of his liabilities under the contract of guarantee – The release or discharge of a principal borrower from the debt owed by it to its creditor, by an involuntary process, i.e. by operation of law, or due to liquidation or insolvency proceeding, does not absolve the surety/guarantor of his or her liability, which arises out of an independent contract. Maxims – Maxim “reddendo singular singulis” – Applicability – Where a sentence in a statute contains several antecedents and several consequences, they are to be read distributively, that is to say, each phrase or expression is to be referred to its appropriate object – When s.60(2) of the Code alludes to insolvency resolution or bankruptcy, or liquidation of three categories, i.e. corporate debtors, corporate guarantors (to corporate debtors) and personal guarantors (to corporate debtors) they apply distributively, i.e. that insolvency resolution, or liquidation processes apply to corporate debtors and their corporate guarantors, whereas insolvency resolution and bankruptcy processes apply to personal guarantors, (to corporate debtors) who cannot be subjected to liquidation – Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 – s.60(2)",

Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 – Whether once a resolution plan is accepted, the corporate debtor is discharged of liability; and as a consequence, the guarantor whose liability is co-extensive with the principal debtor, i.e. the corporate debtor, too is discharged of all liabilities – Held: Approval of a resolution plan relating to a corporate debtor does not ipso facto discharge a personal guarantor (of the corporate debtor) of his liabilities under the contract of guarantee – The release or discharge of a principal borrower from the debt owed by it to its creditor, by an involuntary process, i.e. by operation of law, or due to liquidation or insolvency proceeding, does not absolve the surety/guarantor of his or her liability, which arises out of an independent contract. Maxims – Maxim “reddendo singular singulis” – Applicability – Where a sentence in a statute contains several antecedents and several consequences, they are to be read distributively, that is to say, each phrase or expression is to be referred to its appropriate object – When s.60(2) of the Code alludes to insolvency resolution or bankruptcy, or liquidation of three categories, i.e. corporate debtors, corporate guarantors (to corporate debtors) and personal guarantors (to corporate debtors) they apply distributively, i.e. that insolvency resolution, or liquidation processes apply to corporate debtors and their corporate guarantors, whereas insolvency resolution and bankruptcy processes apply to personal guarantors, (to corporate debtors) who cannot be subjected to liquidation – Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 – s.60(2)",

Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 – Whether once a resolution plan is accepted, the corporate debtor is discharged of liability; and as a consequence, the guarantor whose liability is co-extensive with the principal debtor, i.e. the corporate debtor, too is discharged of all liabilities – Held: Approval of a resolution plan relating to a corporate debtor does not ipso facto discharge a personal guarantor (of the corporate debtor) of his liabilities under the contract of guarantee – The release or discharge of a principal borrower from the debt owed by it to its creditor, by an involuntary process, i.e. by operation of law, or due to liquidation or insolvency proceeding, does not absolve the surety/guarantor of his or her liability, which arises out of an independent contract. Maxims – Maxim “reddendo singular singulis” – Applicability – Where a sentence in a statute contains several antecedents and several consequences, they are to be read distributively, that is to say, each phrase or expression is to be referred to its appropriate object – When s.60(2) of the Code alludes to insolvency resolution or bankruptcy, or liquidation of three categories, i.e. corporate debtors, corporate guarantors (to corporate debtors) and personal guarantors (to corporate debtors) they apply distributively, i.e. that insolvency resolution, or liquidation processes apply to corporate debtors and their corporate guarantors, whereas insolvency resolution and bankruptcy processes apply to personal guarantors, (to corporate debtors) who cannot be subjected to liquidation – Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 – s.60(2)",

Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016: s.7 – Application under – When any corporate debtor commits a default, a financial creditor, an operational creditor or the corporate debtor itself may initiate corporate insolvency resolution process in respect of such corporate debtor, in such manner as provided in Chapter II of the IBC – A financial creditor may either by itself or jointly with other financial creditors, as may be notified by the Government, file an application for initiation of the corporate insolvency resolution process against a corporate debtor before the Adjudicating Authority, when a default has occurred – The trigger point for an application under s.7 of the IBC is the occurrence of a default. Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016: Applicability of Limitation Act to application made under the Code before the NCLT – Held: There is no specific period of limitation prescribed in the Limitation Act, 1963 for an application under the IBC before the NCLT – An application for which no period of limitation is provided anywhere else in the Schedule, is governed by Art.137 of the Schedule to the Limitation Act – Under Art.137 of the Schedule to the Limitation Act, the period of limitation prescribed for such an application is three years from the date of accrual of the right to apply – Limitation Act, 1963 – Art.137Limitation Act, 1963: s.5 – Delay in filing appeal/any application – s.5 of the Limitation Act provides that any appeal or any application, other than an application under any of the provisions of Order XXI of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, may be admitted after the prescribed period of limitation, if the appellant or the applicant satisfies the Court, that he had sufficient cause for not preferring the appeal or making the application within such period – Explanation in s.5 of the Limitation Act clarifies that, the fact that the appellant or the applicant may have been misled by any order, practice or judgment of the High Court in ascertaining or computing the prescribed period, may be sufficient cause within the meaning of this Section. Limitation Act, 1963: s.5 – Condonation of delay in filing an application or appeal – The condition precedent for condonation of the delay in filing an application or appeal, is the existence of sufficient cause – Whether the explanation furnished for the delay would constitute ‘sufficient cause’ or not would depend upon facts of each case – There cannot be any straight jacket formula for accepting or rejecting the explanation furnished by the applicant/ appellant for the delay in taking steps – Acceptance of explanation furnished should be the rule and refusal an exception, when no negligence or inaction or want of bona fides can be imputed to the defaulting party. Limitation Act, 1963: s.5 – Requirement to file application, not mandatory – s.5 of the Limitation Act does not speak of any application – Although, it is the general practice to make a formal application under s.5, in order to enable the Court or Tribunal to weigh the sufficiency of the cause for the inability of the appellant/ applicant to approach the Court/Tribunal within the time prescribed by limitation, there is no bar to exercise by the Court/Tribunal of its discretion to condone delay, in the absence of a formal application – A plain reading of s.5 makes it amply clear that it is not mandatory to file an application in writing before relief can be granted under the said section – Had such an application been mandatory, s.5 of the Limitation Act would have expressly provided so. Limitation Act, 1963: s.14(2) – Exclusion of period for commutation of limitation period – Held: In computing the period of limitation for any application, the time during which the petitioner had been prosecuting, with due diligence, another civil proceeding, whether in a court of first instance, or of appeal or revision, against the same party, for the same relief, shall be excluded, where such proceeding is prosecuted in good faith in a Court which, from defect of jurisdiction or other cause of like nature, is unable to entertain it – The conditions for exclusion are that the earlier proceedings should have been for the same relief, the proceedings should have been prosecuted diligently and in good faith and the proceedings should have been prosecuted in a forum which, from defect of jurisdiction or other cause of a like nature, was unable to entertain it – Where such proceedings have ended, the outer limit to claim exclusion under s.14 would be the date on which the proceedings ended. Limitation Act, 1963: s.14 – Applicability to an application under s.7 of the IBC – Held: Legislature has in its wisdom chosen not to make the provisions of the Limitation Act verbatim applicable to proceedings in NCLT/NCLAT, but consciously used the words ‘as far as may be’ – The words ‘as far as may be’ are not meant to be otiose – Those words are to be understood in the sense in which they best harmonise with the subject matter of the legislation and the object which the Legislature has in view – The Courts would not give an interpretation to those words which would frustrate the purposes of making the Limitation Act applicable to proceedings in the NCLT/NCLAT ‘as far as may be’ – In other words, the provisions of the Limitation Act would apply mutatis mutandis to proceedings under the IBC in the NCLT/NCLAT – Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 –s.238A – Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest Act, 2002. Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016: s.238A – Words ‘as far as may be’ – meaning of – Held: The use of words ‘as far as may be’, occurring in s.238A of the IBC tones down the rigour of the words ‘shall’ in the said Section which is normally considered as mandatory – The expression ‘as far as may be’ is indicative of the fact that all or any of the provisions of the Limitation Act may not apply to proceedings before the Adjudicating Authority (NCLT) or the Appellate authority (NCLAT) if they are patently inconsistent with some provisions of the IBC – At the same time, the words ‘as far as may be’ cannot be construed as a total exclusion of the requirements of the basic principles of s.14 of the Limitation Act, but permits a wider, more liberal, contextual and purposive interpretation by necessary modification, which is in harmony with the principles of the said Section.Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest Act, 2002: s.13(4) – The Chief Metropolitan Magistrate or the Judicial Magistrate, as the case may be, exercising powers under s.14 of the SARFAESI Act, functions as a Civil Court/Executing Court – Proceedings under the SARFAESI Act would, therefore, be deemed to be civil proceedings in a Court – Moreover, proceedings under the SARFAESI Act under s.13(4) are appealable to the DRT under s.18 of the SARFAESI Act – Argument that proceedings under the SARFAESI Act would not qualify for exclusion under s.14 of the Limitation Act, because those proceedings were not conducted in a Civil Court, cannot be sustained. B Limitation Act, 1963: s.14 – Keeping in mind the scope and ambit of proceedings under the IBC before the NCLT/NCLAT, the expression ‘Court’ in s.14(2) would be deemed to be any forum for a civil proceeding including any Tribunal or any forum under the SARFAESI Act – Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest Act, 2002. Limitation Act, 1963: s.5 and s.14 – s.5 and s.14 of the Limitation Act are not mutually exclusive – Even in a case where s.14 does not strictly apply, the principles of s.14 can be invoked to grant relief to an applicant under s.5 of the Limitation Act by purposively construing ‘sufficient cause’ – It is well settled that omission to refer to the correct section of a statute does not vitiate an order – Delay can be condoned irrespective of whether there is any formal application, if there are sufficient materials on record disclosing sufficient cause for the delay – NCLAT rightly refused to stay the proceedings before the NCLT – The judgment and order of the NCLT does not warrant interference.",

        "HeadNote": "Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016: Object and Reasons of the enactment of the Code – Held : Is to consolidate and amend the laws relating to reorganisation and insolvency resolution of corporate persons, partnership firms and individuals in a time bound manner, for maximization of the value of the assets of such persons, to promote entrepreneurship, availability of credit and to balance the interest of all the stakeholders. Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016: s.7 – Application under – When any corporate debtor commits a default, a financial creditor, an operational creditor or the corporate debtor itself may initiate corporate insolvency resolution process in respect of such corporate debtor, in such manner as provided in Chapter II of the IBC – A financial creditor may either by itself or jointly with other financial creditors, as may be notified by the Government, file an application for initiation of the corporate insolvency resolution process against a corporate debtor before the Adjudicating Authority, when a default has occurred – The trigger point for an application under s.7 of the IBC is the occurrence of a default. Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016: Applicability of Limitation Act to application made under the Code before the NCLT – Held: There is no specific period of limitation prescribed in the Limitation Act, 1963 for an application under the IBC before the NCLT – An application for which no period of limitation is provided anywhere else in the Schedule, is governed by Art.137 of the Schedule to the Limitation Act – Under Art.137 of the Schedule to the Limitation Act, the period of limitation prescribed for such an application is three years from the date of accrual of the right to apply – Limitation Act, 1963 – Art.137Limitation Act, 1963: s.5 – Delay in filing appeal/any application – s.5 of the Limitation Act provides that any appeal or any application, other than an application under any of the provisions of Order XXI of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, may be admitted after the prescribed period of limitation, if the appellant or the applicant satisfies the Court, that he had sufficient cause for not preferring the appeal or making the application within such period – Explanation in s.5 of the Limitation Act clarifies that, the fact that the appellant or the applicant may have been misled by any order, practice or judgment of the High Court in ascertaining or computing the prescribed period, may be sufficient cause within the meaning of this Section. Limitation Act, 1963: s.5 – Condonation of delay in filing an application or appeal – The condition precedent for condonation of the delay in filing an application or appeal, is the existence of sufficient cause – Whether the explanation furnished for the delay would constitute ‘sufficient cause’ or not would depend upon facts of each case – There cannot be any straight jacket formula for accepting or rejecting the explanation furnished by the applicant/ appellant for the delay in taking steps – Acceptance of explanation furnished should be the rule and refusal an exception, when no negligence or inaction or want of bona fides can be imputed to the defaulting party. Limitation Act, 1963: s.5 – Requirement to file application, not mandatory – s.5 of the Limitation Act does not speak of any application – Although, it is the general practice to make a formal application under s.5, in order to enable the Court or Tribunal to weigh the sufficiency of the cause for the inability of the appellant/ applicant to approach the Court/Tribunal within the time prescribed by limitation, there is no bar to exercise by the Court/Tribunal of its discretion to condone delay, in the absence of a formal application – A plain reading of s.5 makes it amply clear that it is not mandatory to file an application in writing before relief can be granted under the said section – Had such an application been mandatory, s.5 of the Limitation Act would have expressly provided so. Limitation Act, 1963: s.14(2) – Exclusion of period for commutation of limitation period – Held: In computing the period of limitation for any application, the time during which the petitioner had been prosecuting, with due diligence, another civil proceeding, whether in a court of first instance, or of appeal or revision, against the same party, for the same relief, shall be excluded, where such proceeding is prosecuted in good faith in a Court which, from defect of jurisdiction or other cause of like nature, is unable to entertain it – The conditions for exclusion are that the earlier proceedings should have been for the same relief, the proceedings should have been prosecuted diligently and in good faith and the proceedings should have been prosecuted in a forum which, from defect of jurisdiction or other cause of a like nature, was unable to entertain it – Where such proceedings have ended, the outer limit to claim exclusion under s.14 would be the date on which the proceedings ended. Limitation Act, 1963: s.14 – Applicability to an application under s.7 of the IBC – Held: Legislature has in its wisdom chosen not to make the provisions of the Limitation Act verbatim applicable to proceedings in NCLT/NCLAT, but consciously used the words ‘as far as may be’ – The words ‘as far as may be’ are not meant to be otiose – Those words are to be understood in the sense in which they best harmonise with the subject matter of the legislation and the object which the Legislature has in view – The Courts would not give an interpretation to those words which would frustrate the purposes of making the Limitation Act applicable to proceedings in the NCLT/NCLAT ‘as far as may be’ – In other words, the provisions of the Limitation Act would apply mutatis mutandis to proceedings under the IBC in the NCLT/NCLAT – Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 –s.238A – Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest Act, 2002. Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016: s.238A – Words ‘as far as may be’ – meaning of – Held: The use of words ‘as far as may be’, occurring in s.238A of the IBC tones down the rigour of the words ‘shall’ in the said Section which is normally considered as mandatory – The expression ‘as far as may be’ is indicative of the fact that all or any of the provisions of the Limitation Act may not apply to proceedings before the Adjudicating Authority (NCLT) or the Appellate authority (NCLAT) if they are patently inconsistent with some provisions of the IBC – At the same time, the words ‘as far as may be’ cannot be construed as a total exclusion of the requirements of the basic principles of s.14 of the Limitation Act, but permits a wider, more liberal, contextual and purposive interpretation by necessary modification, which is in harmony with the principles of the said Section.Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest Act, 2002: s.13(4) – The Chief Metropolitan Magistrate or the Judicial Magistrate, as the case may be, exercising powers under s.14 of the SARFAESI Act, functions as a Civil Court/Executing Court – Proceedings under the SARFAESI Act would, therefore, be deemed to be civil proceedings in a Court – Moreover, proceedings under the SARFAESI Act under s.13(4) are appealable to the DRT under s.18 of the SARFAESI Act – Argument that proceedings under the SARFAESI Act would not qualify for exclusion under s.14 of the Limitation Act, because those proceedings were not conducted in a Civil Court, cannot be sustained. B Limitation Act, 1963: s.14 – Keeping in mind the scope and ambit of proceedings under the IBC before the NCLT/NCLAT, the expression ‘Court’ in s.14(2) would be deemed to be any forum for a civil proceeding including any Tribunal or any forum under the SARFAESI Act – Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest Act, 2002. Limitation Act, 1963: s.5 and s.14 – s.5 and s.14 of the Limitation Act are not mutually exclusive – Even in a case where s.14 does not strictly apply, the principles of s.14 can be invoked to grant relief to an applicant under s.5 of the Limitation Act by purposively construing ‘sufficient cause’ – It is well settled that omission to refer to the correct section of a statute does not vitiate an order – Delay can be condoned irrespective of whether there is any formal application, if there are sufficient materials on record disclosing sufficient cause for the delay – NCLAT rightly refused to stay the proceedings before the NCLT – The judgment and order of the NCLT does not warrant interference.",

        "HeadNote": "Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016: Object and Reasons of the enactment of the Code – Held : Is to consolidate and amend the laws relating to reorganisation and insolvency resolution of corporate persons, partnership firms and individuals in a time bound manner, for maximization of the value of the assets of such persons, to promote entrepreneurship, availability of credit and to balance the interest of all the stakeholders. Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016: s.7 – Application under – When any corporate debtor commits a default, a financial creditor, an operational creditor or the corporate debtor itself may initiate corporate insolvency resolution process in respect of such corporate debtor, in such manner as provided in Chapter II of the IBC – A financial creditor may either by itself or jointly with other financial creditors, as may be notified by the Government, file an application for initiation of the corporate insolvency resolution process against a corporate debtor before the Adjudicating Authority, when a default has occurred – The trigger point for an application under s.7 of the IBC is the occurrence of a default. Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016: Applicability of Limitation Act to application made under the Code before the NCLT – Held: There is no specific period of limitation prescribed in the Limitation Act, 1963 for an application under the IBC before the NCLT – An application for which no period of limitation is provided anywhere else in the Schedule, is governed by Art.137 of the Schedule to the Limitation Act – Under Art.137 of the Schedule to the Limitation Act, the period of limitation prescribed for such an application is three years from the date of accrual of the right to apply – Limitation Act, 1963 – Art.137Limitation Act, 1963: s.5 – Delay in filing appeal/any application – s.5 of the Limitation Act provides that any appeal or any application, other than an application under any of the provisions of Order XXI of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, may be admitted after the prescribed period of limitation, if the appellant or the applicant satisfies the Court, that he had sufficient cause for not preferring the appeal or making the application within such period – Explanation in s.5 of the Limitation Act clarifies that, the fact that the appellant or the applicant may have been misled by any order, practice or judgment of the High Court in ascertaining or computing the prescribed period, may be sufficient cause within the meaning of this Section. Limitation Act, 1963: s.5 – Condonation of delay in filing an application or appeal – The condition precedent for condonation of the delay in filing an application or appeal, is the existence of sufficient cause – Whether the explanation furnished for the delay would constitute ‘sufficient cause’ or not would depend upon facts of each case – There cannot be any straight jacket formula for accepting or rejecting the explanation furnished by the applicant/ appellant for the delay in taking steps – Acceptance of explanation furnished should be the rule and refusal an exception, when no negligence or inaction or want of bona fides can be imputed to the defaulting party. Limitation Act, 1963: s.5 – Requirement to file application, not mandatory – s.5 of the Limitation Act does not speak of any application – Although, it is the general practice to make a formal application under s.5, in order to enable the Court or Tribunal to weigh the sufficiency of the cause for the inability of the appellant/ applicant to approach the Court/Tribunal within the time prescribed by limitation, there is no bar to exercise by the Court/Tribunal of its discretion to condone delay, in the absence of a formal application – A plain reading of s.5 makes it amply clear that it is not mandatory to file an application in writing before relief can be granted under the said section – Had such an application been mandatory, s.5 of the Limitation Act would have expressly provided so. Limitation Act, 1963: s.14(2) – Exclusion of period for commutation of limitation period – Held: In computing the period of limitation for any application, the time during which the petitioner had been prosecuting, with due diligence, another civil proceeding, whether in a court of first instance, or of appeal or revision, against the same party, for the same relief, shall be excluded, where such proceeding is prosecuted in good faith in a Court which, from defect of jurisdiction or other cause of like nature, is unable to entertain it – The conditions for exclusion are that the earlier proceedings should have been for the same relief, the proceedings should have been prosecuted diligently and in good faith and the proceedings should have been prosecuted in a forum which, from defect of jurisdiction or other cause of a like nature, was unable to entertain it – Where such proceedings have ended, the outer limit to claim exclusion under s.14 would be the date on which the proceedings ended. Limitation Act, 1963: s.14 – Applicability to an application under s.7 of the IBC – Held: Legislature has in its wisdom chosen not to make the provisions of the Limitation Act verbatim applicable to proceedings in NCLT/NCLAT, but consciously used the words ‘as far as may be’ – The words ‘as far as may be’ are not meant to be otiose – Those words are to be understood in the sense in which they best harmonise with the subject matter of the legislation and the object which the Legislature has in view – The Courts would not give an interpretation to those words which would frustrate the purposes of making the Limitation Act applicable to proceedings in the NCLT/NCLAT ‘as far as may be’ – In other words, the provisions of the Limitation Act would apply mutatis mutandis to proceedings under the IBC in the NCLT/NCLAT – Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 –s.238A – Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest Act, 2002. Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016: s.238A – Words ‘as far as may be’ – meaning of – Held: The use of words ‘as far as may be’, occurring in s.238A of the IBC tones down the rigour of the words ‘shall’ in the said Section which is normally considered as mandatory – The expression ‘as far as may be’ is indicative of the fact that all or any of the provisions of the Limitation Act may not apply to proceedings before the Adjudicating Authority (NCLT) or the Appellate authority (NCLAT) if they are patently inconsistent with some provisions of the IBC – At the same time, the words ‘as far as may be’ cannot be construed as a total exclusion of the requirements of the basic principles of s.14 of the Limitation Act, but permits a wider, more liberal, contextual and purposive interpretation by necessary modification, which is in harmony with the principles of the said Section.Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest Act, 2002: s.13(4) – The Chief Metropolitan Magistrate or the Judicial Magistrate, as the case may be, exercising powers under s.14 of the SARFAESI Act, functions as a Civil Court/Executing Court – Proceedings under the SARFAESI Act would, therefore, be deemed to be civil proceedings in a Court – Moreover, proceedings under the SARFAESI Act under s.13(4) are appealable to the DRT under s.18 of the SARFAESI Act – Argument that proceedings under the SARFAESI Act would not qualify for exclusion under s.14 of the Limitation Act, because those proceedings were not conducted in a Civil Court, cannot be sustained. B Limitation Act, 1963: s.14 – Keeping in mind the scope and ambit of proceedings under the IBC before the NCLT/NCLAT, the expression ‘Court’ in s.14(2) would be deemed to be any forum for a civil proceeding including any Tribunal or any forum under the SARFAESI Act – Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest Act, 2002. Limitation Act, 1963: s.5 and s.14 – s.5 and s.14 of the Limitation Act are not mutually exclusive – Even in a case where s.14 does not strictly apply, the principles of s.14 can be invoked to grant relief to an applicant under s.5 of the Limitation Act by purposively construing ‘sufficient cause’ – It is well settled that omission to refer to the correct section of a statute does not vitiate an order – Delay can be condoned irrespective of whether there is any formal application, if there are sufficient materials on record disclosing sufficient cause for the delay – NCLAT rightly refused to stay the proceedings before the NCLT – The judgment and order of the NCLT does not warrant interference.",

        "HeadNote": "Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016: Object and Reasons of the enactment of the Code – Held : Is to consolidate and amend the laws relating to reorganisation and insolvency resolution of corporate persons, partnership firms and individuals in a time bound manner, for maximization of the value of the assets of such persons, to promote entrepreneurship, availability of credit and to balance the interest of all the stakeholders. Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016: s.7 – Application under – When any corporate debtor commits a default, a financial creditor, an operational creditor or the corporate debtor itself may initiate corporate insolvency resolution process in respect of such corporate debtor, in such manner as provided in Chapter II of the IBC – A financial creditor may either by itself or jointly with other financial creditors, as may be notified by the Government, file an application for initiation of the corporate insolvency resolution process against a corporate debtor before the Adjudicating Authority, when a default has occurred – The trigger point for an application under s.7 of the IBC is the occurrence of a default. Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016: Applicability of Limitation Act to application made under the Code before the NCLT – Held: There is no specific period of limitation prescribed in the Limitation Act, 1963 for an application under the IBC before the NCLT – An application for which no period of limitation is provided anywhere else in the Schedule, is governed by Art.137 of the Schedule to the Limitation Act – Under Art.137 of the Schedule to the Limitation Act, the period of limitation prescribed for such an application is three years from the date of accrual of the right to apply – Limitation Act, 1963 – Art.137Limitation Act, 1963: s.5 – Delay in filing appeal/any application – s.5 of the Limitation Act provides that any appeal or any application, other than an application under any of the provisions of Order XXI of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, may be admitted after the prescribed period of limitation, if the appellant or the applicant satisfies the Court, that he had sufficient cause for not preferring the appeal or making the application within such period – Explanation in s.5 of the Limitation Act clarifies that, the fact that the appellant or the applicant may have been misled by any order, practice or judgment of the High Court in ascertaining or computing the prescribed period, may be sufficient cause within the meaning of this Section. Limitation Act, 1963: s.5 – Condonation of delay in filing an application or appeal – The condition precedent for condonation of the delay in filing an application or appeal, is the existence of sufficient cause – Whether the explanation furnished for the delay would constitute ‘sufficient cause’ or not would depend upon facts of each case – There cannot be any straight jacket formula for accepting or rejecting the explanation furnished by the applicant/ appellant for the delay in taking steps – Acceptance of explanation furnished should be the rule and refusal an exception, when no negligence or inaction or want of bona fides can be imputed to the defaulting party. Limitation Act, 1963: s.5 – Requirement to file application, not mandatory – s.5 of the Limitation Act does not speak of any application – Although, it is the general practice to make a formal application under s.5, in order to enable the Court or Tribunal to weigh the sufficiency of the cause for the inability of the appellant/ applicant to approach the Court/Tribunal within the time prescribed by limitation, there is no bar to exercise by the Court/Tribunal of its discretion to condone delay, in the absence of a formal application – A plain reading of s.5 makes it amply clear that it is not mandatory to file an application in writing before relief can be granted under the said section – Had such an application been mandatory, s.5 of the Limitation Act would have expressly provided so. Limitation Act, 1963: s.14(2) – Exclusion of period for commutation of limitation period – Held: In computing the period of limitation for any application, the time during which the petitioner had been prosecuting, with due diligence, another civil proceeding, whether in a court of first instance, or of appeal or revision, against the same party, for the same relief, shall be excluded, where such proceeding is prosecuted in good faith in a Court which, from defect of jurisdiction or other cause of like nature, is unable to entertain it – The conditions for exclusion are that the earlier proceedings should have been for the same relief, the proceedings should have been prosecuted diligently and in good faith and the proceedings should have been prosecuted in a forum which, from defect of jurisdiction or other cause of a like nature, was unable to entertain it – Where such proceedings have ended, the outer limit to claim exclusion under s.14 would be the date on which the proceedings ended. Limitation Act, 1963: s.14 – Applicability to an application under s.7 of the IBC – Held: Legislature has in its wisdom chosen not to make the provisions of the Limitation Act verbatim applicable to proceedings in NCLT/NCLAT, but consciously used the words ‘as far as may be’ – The words ‘as far as may be’ are not meant to be otiose – Those words are to be understood in the sense in which they best harmonise with the subject matter of the legislation and the object which the Legislature has in view – The Courts would not give an interpretation to those words which would frustrate the purposes of making the Limitation Act applicable to proceedings in the NCLT/NCLAT ‘as far as may be’ – In other words, the provisions of the Limitation Act would apply mutatis mutandis to proceedings under the IBC in the NCLT/NCLAT – Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 –s.238A – Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest Act, 2002. Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016: s.238A – Words ‘as far as may be’ – meaning of – Held: The use of words ‘as far as may be’, occurring in s.238A of the IBC tones down the rigour of the words ‘shall’ in the said Section which is normally considered as mandatory – The expression ‘as far as may be’ is indicative of the fact that all or any of the provisions of the Limitation Act may not apply to proceedings before the Adjudicating Authority (NCLT) or the Appellate authority (NCLAT) if they are patently inconsistent with some provisions of the IBC – At the same time, the words ‘as far as may be’ cannot be construed as a total exclusion of the requirements of the basic principles of s.14 of the Limitation Act, but permits a wider, more liberal, contextual and purposive interpretation by necessary modification, which is in harmony with the principles of the said Section.Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest Act, 2002: s.13(4) – The Chief Metropolitan Magistrate or the Judicial Magistrate, as the case may be, exercising powers under s.14 of the SARFAESI Act, functions as a Civil Court/Executing Court – Proceedings under the SARFAESI Act would, therefore, be deemed to be civil proceedings in a Court – Moreover, proceedings under the SARFAESI Act under s.13(4) are appealable to the DRT under s.18 of the SARFAESI Act – Argument that proceedings under the SARFAESI Act would not qualify for exclusion under s.14 of the Limitation Act, because those proceedings were not conducted in a Civil Court, cannot be sustained. B Limitation Act, 1963: s.14 – Keeping in mind the scope and ambit of proceedings under the IBC before the NCLT/NCLAT, the expression ‘Court’ in s.14(2) would be deemed to be any forum for a civil proceeding including any Tribunal or any forum under the SARFAESI Act – Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest Act, 2002. Limitation Act, 1963: s.5 and s.14 – s.5 and s.14 of the Limitation Act are not mutually exclusive – Even in a case where s.14 does not strictly apply, the principles of s.14 can be invoked to grant relief to an applicant under s.5 of the Limitation Act by purposively construing ‘sufficient cause’ – It is well settled that omission to refer to the correct section of a statute does not vitiate an order – Delay can be condoned irrespective of whether there is any formal application, if there are sufficient materials on record disclosing sufficient cause for the delay – NCLAT rightly refused to stay the proceedings before the NCLT – The judgment and order of the NCLT does not warrant interference.",

        "HeadNote": "Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016: Object and Reasons of the enactment of the Code – Held : Is to consolidate and amend the laws relating to reorganisation and insolvency resolution of corporate persons, partnership firms and individuals in a time bound manner, for maximization of the value of the assets of such persons, to promote entrepreneurship, availability of credit and to balance the interest of all the stakeholders. Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016: s.7 – Application under – When any corporate debtor commits a default, a financial creditor, an operational creditor or the corporate debtor itself may initiate corporate insolvency resolution process in respect of such corporate debtor, in such manner as provided in Chapter II of the IBC – A financial creditor may either by itself or jointly with other financial creditors, as may be notified by the Government, file an application for initiation of the corporate insolvency resolution process against a corporate debtor before the Adjudicating Authority, when a default has occurred – The trigger point for an application under s.7 of the IBC is the occurrence of a default. Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016: Applicability of Limitation Act to application made under the Code before the NCLT – Held: There is no specific period of limitation prescribed in the Limitation Act, 1963 for an application under the IBC before the NCLT – An application for which no period of limitation is provided anywhere else in the Schedule, is governed by Art.137 of the Schedule to the Limitation Act – Under Art.137 of the Schedule to the Limitation Act, the period of limitation prescribed for such an application is three years from the date of accrual of the right to apply – Limitation Act, 1963 – Art.137Limitation Act, 1963: s.5 – Delay in filing appeal/any application – s.5 of the Limitation Act provides that any appeal or any application, other than an application under any of the provisions of Order XXI of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, may be admitted after the prescribed period of limitation, if the appellant or the applicant satisfies the Court, that he had sufficient cause for not preferring the appeal or making the application within such period – Explanation in s.5 of the Limitation Act clarifies that, the fact that the appellant or the applicant may have been misled by any order, practice or judgment of the High Court in ascertaining or computing the prescribed period, may be sufficient cause within the meaning of this Section. Limitation Act, 1963: s.5 – Condonation of delay in filing an application or appeal – The condition precedent for condonation of the delay in filing an application or appeal, is the existence of sufficient cause – Whether the explanation furnished for the delay would constitute ‘sufficient cause’ or not would depend upon facts of each case – There cannot be any straight jacket formula for accepting or rejecting the explanation furnished by the applicant/ appellant for the delay in taking steps – Acceptance of explanation furnished should be the rule and refusal an exception, when no negligence or inaction or want of bona fides can be imputed to the defaulting party. Limitation Act, 1963: s.5 – Requirement to file application, not mandatory – s.5 of the Limitation Act does not speak of any application – Although, it is the general practice to make a formal application under s.5, in order to enable the Court or Tribunal to weigh the sufficiency of the cause for the inability of the appellant/ applicant to approach the Court/Tribunal within the time prescribed by limitation, there is no bar to exercise by the Court/Tribunal of its discretion to condone delay, in the absence of a formal application – A plain reading of s.5 makes it amply clear that it is not mandatory to file an application in writing before relief can be granted under the said section – Had such an application been mandatory, s.5 of the Limitation Act would have expressly provided so. Limitation Act, 1963: s.14(2) – Exclusion of period for commutation of limitation period – Held: In computing the period of limitation for any application, the time during which the petitioner had been prosecuting, with due diligence, another civil proceeding, whether in a court of first instance, or of appeal or revision, against the same party, for the same relief, shall be excluded, where such proceeding is prosecuted in good faith in a Court which, from defect of jurisdiction or other cause of like nature, is unable to entertain it – The conditions for exclusion are that the earlier proceedings should have been for the same relief, the proceedings should have been prosecuted diligently and in good faith and the proceedings should have been prosecuted in a forum which, from defect of jurisdiction or other cause of a like nature, was unable to entertain it – Where such proceedings have ended, the outer limit to claim exclusion under s.14 would be the date on which the proceedings ended. Limitation Act, 1963: s.14 – Applicability to an application under s.7 of the IBC – Held: Legislature has in its wisdom chosen not to make the provisions of the Limitation Act verbatim applicable to proceedings in NCLT/NCLAT, but consciously used the words ‘as far as may be’ – The words ‘as far as may be’ are not meant to be otiose – Those words are to be understood in the sense in which they best harmonise with the subject matter of the legislation and the object which the Legislature has in view – The Courts would not give an interpretation to those words which would frustrate the purposes of making the Limitation Act applicable to proceedings in the NCLT/NCLAT ‘as far as may be’ – In other words, the provisions of the Limitation Act would apply mutatis mutandis to proceedings under the IBC in the NCLT/NCLAT – Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 –s.238A – Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest Act, 2002. Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016: s.238A – Words ‘as far as may be’ – meaning of – Held: The use of words ‘as far as may be’, occurring in s.238A of the IBC tones down the rigour of the words ‘shall’ in the said Section which is normally considered as mandatory – The expression ‘as far as may be’ is indicative of the fact that all or any of the provisions of the Limitation Act may not apply to proceedings before the Adjudicating Authority (NCLT) or the Appellate authority (NCLAT) if they are patently inconsistent with some provisions of the IBC – At the same time, the words ‘as far as may be’ cannot be construed as a total exclusion of the requirements of the basic principles of s.14 of the Limitation Act, but permits a wider, more liberal, contextual and purposive interpretation by necessary modification, which is in harmony with the principles of the said Section.Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest Act, 2002: s.13(4) – The Chief Metropolitan Magistrate or the Judicial Magistrate, as the case may be, exercising powers under s.14 of the SARFAESI Act, functions as a Civil Court/Executing Court – Proceedings under the SARFAESI Act would, therefore, be deemed to be civil proceedings in a Court – Moreover, proceedings under the SARFAESI Act under s.13(4) are appealable to the DRT under s.18 of the SARFAESI Act – Argument that proceedings under the SARFAESI Act would not qualify for exclusion under s.14 of the Limitation Act, because those proceedings were not conducted in a Civil Court, cannot be sustained. B Limitation Act, 1963: s.14 – Keeping in mind the scope and ambit of proceedings under the IBC before the NCLT/NCLAT, the expression ‘Court’ in s.14(2) would be deemed to be any forum for a civil proceeding including any Tribunal or any forum under the SARFAESI Act – Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest Act, 2002. Limitation Act, 1963: s.5 and s.14 – s.5 and s.14 of the Limitation Act are not mutually exclusive – Even in a case where s.14 does not strictly apply, the principles of s.14 can be invoked to grant relief to an applicant under s.5 of the Limitation Act by purposively construing ‘sufficient cause’ – It is well settled that omission to refer to the correct section of a statute does not vitiate an order – Delay can be condoned irrespective of whether there is any formal application, if there are sufficient materials on record disclosing sufficient cause for the delay – NCLAT rightly refused to stay the proceedings before the NCLT – The judgment and order of the NCLT does not warrant interference.",

Limitation Act, 1963: s. 5 – Application of s. 5, to appeals u/ s. 37 of the 1996 Act and to s. 13(1A) of the CC Act – Held: s. 37 when read with s. 43 thereof, makes it clear that the provisions of the Limitation Act would apply to appeals filed u/s. 37 – Appeal u/ s. 37 where specified value within the meaning of the CC Act is below 3 lakhs, are governed by Arts. 116 and 117 – Arts. 116 and 117 of the Limitation Act provide for a limitation period of 90 days and 30 days, for appeal to a High Court or an intra-High Court appeal – Thus, s. 5 of the Limitation Act would apply to the said appeals, both by virtue of s. 43 of the 1996 Act and s. 29(2) of the Limitation Act – Arts. 116, 117, s. 29(2) – Commercial Courts Act, 2015. s. 5 – Application of, to appeals u/s. 13(1A) of the CC Act providing a uniform 60-day period of limitation – Held: A middle course to be adopted between the N.V. International’s case which does not allow condonation of delay beyond 30 days, and an open- ended provision in which any amount of delay can be condoned, provided sufficient cause is shown – Maxim ut res magis valeat quam pereat-liberal construction should be put upon written instruments, to be followed – Commercial Courts Act, 2015. Constitution of India – Art. 141 – Binding precedent – N.V. International v. State of Assam’s case applied the provisions of s. 5 of the Limitation Act and held that no condonation of delay could take place beyond 120 days – Whether the hard and fast rule applied by this Court in N.V. International’s case, is correct in law – Held: N.V. International’s case while determining limitation period for filing appeal u/s. 37 did not notice the provisions of the CC Act at all and can be said to be per incuriam on this count - Period of 90 days plus 30 days and not thereafter mentioned in s. 34(3) of the 1996 Act cannot now apply, the limitation period for filing of appeals under the CC Act being 60 days and not 90 days – Thus, N.V.

Limitation Act, 1963: s. 5 – Application of s. 5, to appeals u/ s. 37 of the 1996 Act and to s. 13(1A) of the CC Act – Held: s. 37 when read with s. 43 thereof, makes it clear that the provisions of the Limitation Act would apply to appeals filed u/s. 37 – Appeal u/ s. 37 where specified value within the meaning of the CC Act is below 3 lakhs, are governed by Arts. 116 and 117 – Arts. 116 and 117 of the Limitation Act provide for a limitation period of 90 days and 30 days, for appeal to a High Court or an intra-High Court appeal – Thus, s. 5 of the Limitation Act would apply to the said appeals, both by virtue of s. 43 of the 1996 Act and s. 29(2) of the Limitation Act – Arts. 116, 117, s. 29(2) – Commercial Courts Act, 2015. s. 5 – Application of, to appeals u/s. 13(1A) of the CC Act providing a uniform 60-day period of limitation – Held: A middle course to be adopted between the N.V. International’s case which does not allow condonation of delay beyond 30 days, and an open- ended provision in which any amount of delay can be condoned, provided sufficient cause is shown – Maxim ut res magis valeat quam pereat-liberal construction should be put upon written instruments, to be followed – Commercial Courts Act, 2015. Constitution of India – Art. 141 – Binding precedent – N.V. International v. State of Assam’s case applied the provisions of s. 5 of the Limitation Act and held that no condonation of delay could take place beyond 120 days – Whether the hard and fast rule applied by this Court in N.V. International’s case, is correct in law – Held: N.V. International’s case while determining limitation period for filing appeal u/s. 37 did not notice the provisions of the CC Act at all and can be said to be per incuriam on this count - Period of 90 days plus 30 days and not thereafter mentioned in s. 34(3) of the 1996 Act cannot now apply, the limitation period for filing of appeals under the CC Act being 60 days and not 90 days – Thus, N.V. International’s case has been wrongly decided and is overruled – Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 – ss. 37 and 34(3) – Commercial Courts Act, 2015",

Limitation Act, 1963: s. 5 – Application of s. 5, to appeals u/ s. 37 of the 1996 Act and to s. 13(1A) of the CC Act – Held: s. 37 when read with s. 43 thereof, makes it clear that the provisions of the Limitation Act would apply to appeals filed u/s. 37 – Appeal u/ s. 37 where specified value within the meaning of the CC Act is below 3 lakhs, are governed by Arts. 116 and 117 – Arts. 116 and 117 of the Limitation Act provide for a limitation period of 90 days and 30 days, for appeal to a High Court or an intra-High Court appeal – Thus, s. 5 of the Limitation Act would apply to the said appeals, both by virtue of s. 43 of the 1996 Act and s. 29(2) of the Limitation Act – Arts. 116, 117, s. 29(2) – Commercial Courts Act, 2015. s. 5 – Application of, to appeals u/s. 13(1A) of the CC Act providing a uniform 60-day period of limitation – Held: A middle course to be adopted between the N.V. International’s case which does not allow condonation of delay beyond 30 days, and an open- ended provision in which any amount of delay can be condoned, provided sufficient cause is shown – Maxim ut res magis valeat quam pereat-liberal construction should be put upon written instruments, to be followed – Commercial Courts Act, 2015. Constitution of India – Art. 141 – Binding precedent – N.V. International v. State of Assam’s case applied the provisions of s. 5 of the Limitation Act and held that no condonation of delay could take place beyond 120 days – Whether the hard and fast rule applied by this Court in N.V. International’s case, is correct in law – Held: N.V. International’s case while determining limitation period for filing appeal u/s. 37 did not notice the provisions of the CC Act at all and can be said to be per incuriam on this count - Period of 90 days plus 30 days and not thereafter mentioned in s. 34(3) of the 1996 Act cannot now apply, the limitation period for filing of appeals under the CC Act being 60 days and not 90 days – Thus, N.V. International’s case has been wrongly decided and is overruled – Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 – ss. 37 and 34(3) – Commercial Courts Act, 2015",

Limitation Act, 1963: s. 5 – Application of s. 5, to appeals u/ s. 37 of the 1996 Act and to s. 13(1A) of the CC Act – Held: s. 37 when read with s. 43 thereof, makes it clear that the provisions of the Limitation Act would apply to appeals filed u/s. 37 – Appeal u/ s. 37 where specified value within the meaning of the CC Act is below 3 lakhs, are governed by Arts. 116 and 117 – Arts. 116 and 117 of the Limitation Act provide for a limitation period of 90 days and 30 days, for appeal to a High Court or an intra-High Court appeal – Thus, s. 5 of the Limitation Act would apply to the said appeals, both by virtue of s. 43 of the 1996 Act and s. 29(2) of the Limitation Act – Arts. 116, 117, s. 29(2) – Commercial Courts Act, 2015. s. 5 – Application of, to appeals u/s. 13(1A) of the CC Act providing a uniform 60-day period of limitation – Held: A middle course to be adopted between the N.V. International’s case which does not allow condonation of delay beyond 30 days, and an open- ended provision in which any amount of delay can be condoned, provided sufficient cause is shown – Maxim ut res magis valeat quam pereat-liberal construction should be put upon written instruments, to be followed – Commercial Courts Act, 2015. Constitution of India – Art. 141 – Binding precedent – N.V. International v. State of Assam’s case applied the provisions of s. 5 of the Limitation Act and held that no condonation of delay could take place beyond 120 days – Whether the hard and fast rule applied by this Court in N.V. International’s case, is correct in law – Held: N.V. International’s case while determining limitation period for filing appeal u/s. 37 did not notice the provisions of the CC Act at all and can be said to be per incuriam on this count - Period of 90 days plus 30 days and not thereafter mentioned in s. 34(3) of the 1996 Act cannot now apply, the limitation period for filing of appeals under the CC Act being 60 days and not 90 days – Thus, N.V. International’s case has been wrongly decided and is overruled – Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 – ss. 37 and 34(3) – Commercial Courts Act, 2015",

Limitation Act, 1963: s. 5 – Application of s. 5, to appeals u/ s. 37 of the 1996 Act and to s. 13(1A) of the CC Act – Held: s. 37 when read with s. 43 thereof, makes it clear that the provisions of the Limitation Act would apply to appeals filed u/s. 37 – Appeal u/ s. 37 where specified value within the meaning of the CC Act is below 3 lakhs, are governed by Arts. 116 and 117 – Arts. 116 and 117 of the Limitation Act provide for a limitation period of 90 days and 30 days, for appeal to a High Court or an intra-High Court appeal – Thus, s. 5 of the Limitation Act would apply to the said appeals, both by virtue of s. 43 of the 1996 Act and s. 29(2) of the Limitation Act – Arts. 116, 117, s. 29(2) – Commercial Courts Act, 2015. s. 5 – Application of, to appeals u/s. 13(1A) of the CC Act providing a uniform 60-day period of limitation – Held: A middle course to be adopted between the N.V. International’s case which does not allow condonation of delay beyond 30 days, and an open- ended provision in which any amount of delay can be condoned, provided sufficient cause is shown – Maxim ut res magis valeat quam pereat-liberal construction should be put upon written instruments, to be followed – Commercial Courts Act, 2015. Constitution of India – Art. 141 – Binding precedent – N.V. International v. State of Assam’s case applied the provisions of s. 5 of the Limitation Act and held that no condonation of delay could take place beyond 120 days – Whether the hard and fast rule applied by this Court in N.V. International’s case, is correct in law – Held: N.V. International’s case while determining limitation period for filing appeal u/s. 37 did not notice the provisions of the CC Act at all and can be said to be per incuriam on this count - Period of 90 days plus 30 days and not thereafter mentioned in s. 34(3) of the 1996 Act cannot now apply, the limitation period for filing of appeals under the CC Act being 60 days and not 90 days – Thus, N.V. International’s case has been wrongly decided and is overruled – Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 – ss. 37 and 34(3) – Commercial Courts Act, 2015",

Limitation Act, 1963: s. 5 – Application of s. 5, to appeals u/ s. 37 of the 1996 Act and to s. 13(1A) of the CC Act – Held: s. 37 when read with s. 43 thereof, makes it clear that the provisions of the Limitation Act would apply to appeals filed u/s. 37 – Appeal u/ s. 37 where specified value within the meaning of the CC Act is below 3 lakhs, are governed by Arts. 116 and 117 – Arts. 116 and 117 of the Limitation Act provide for a limitation period of 90 days and 30 days, for appeal to a High Court or an intra-High Court appeal – Thus, s. 5 of the Limitation Act would apply to the said appeals, both by virtue of s. 43 of the 1996 Act and s. 29(2) of the Limitation Act – Arts. 116, 117, s. 29(2) – Commercial Courts Act, 2015. s. 5 – Application of, to appeals u/s. 13(1A) of the CC Act providing a uniform 60-day period of limitation – Held: A middle course to be adopted between the N.V. International’s case which does not allow condonation of delay beyond 30 days, and an open- ended provision in which any amount of delay can be condoned, provided sufficient cause is shown – Maxim ut res magis valeat quam pereat-liberal construction should be put upon written instruments, to be followed – Commercial Courts Act, 2015. Constitution of India – Art. 141 – Binding precedent – N.V. International v. State of Assam’s case applied the provisions of s. 5 of the Limitation Act and held that no condonation of delay could take place beyond 120 days – Whether the hard and fast rule applied by this Court in N.V. International’s case, is correct in law – Held: N.V. International’s case while determining limitation period for filing appeal u/s. 37 did not notice the provisions of the CC Act at all and can be said to be per incuriam on this count - Period of 90 days plus 30 days and not thereafter mentioned in s. 34(3) of the 1996 Act cannot now apply, the limitation period for filing of appeals under the CC Act being 60 days and not 90 days – Thus, N.V. International’s case has been wrongly decided and is overruled – Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 – ss. 37 and 34(3) – Commercial Courts Act, 2015",

Limitation Act, 1963: s. 5 – Application of s. 5, to appeals u/ s. 37 of the 1996 Act and to s. 13(1A) of the CC Act – Held: s. 37 when read with s. 43 thereof, makes it clear that the provisions of the Limitation Act would apply to appeals filed u/s. 37 – Appeal u/ s. 37 where specified value within the meaning of the CC Act is below 3 lakhs, are governed by Arts. 116 and 117 – Arts. 116 and 117 of the Limitation Act provide for a limitation period of 90 days and 30 days, for appeal to a High Court or an intra-High Court appeal – Thus, s. 5 of the Limitation Act would apply to the said appeals, both by virtue of s. 43 of the 1996 Act and s. 29(2) of the Limitation Act – Arts. 116, 117, s. 29(2) – Commercial Courts Act, 2015. s. 5 – Application of, to appeals u/s. 13(1A) of the CC Act providing a uniform 60-day period of limitation – Held: A middle course to be adopted between the N.V. International’s case which does not allow condonation of delay beyond 30 days, and an open- ended provision in which any amount of delay can be condoned, provided sufficient cause is shown – Maxim ut res magis valeat quam pereat-liberal construction should be put upon written instruments, to be followed – Commercial Courts Act, 2015. Constitution of India – Art. 141 – Binding precedent – N.V. International v. State of Assam’s case applied the provisions of s. 5 of the Limitation Act and held that no condonation of delay could take place beyond 120 days – Whether the hard and fast rule applied by this Court in N.V. International’s case, is correct in law – Held: N.V. International’s case while determining limitation period for filing appeal u/s. 37 did not notice the provisions of the CC Act at all and can be said to be per incuriam on this count - Period of 90 days plus 30 days and not thereafter mentioned in s. 34(3) of the 1996 Act cannot now apply, the limitation period for filing of appeals under the CC Act being 60 days and not 90 days – Thus, N.V. International’s case has been wrongly decided and is overruled – Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 – ss. 37 and 34(3) – Commercial Courts Act, 2015",

State of Assam’s case applied the provisions of s. 5 of the Limitation Act and held that no condonation of delay could take place beyond 120 days – Whether the hard and fast rule applied by this Court in N.V. International’s case, is correct in law – Held: N.V. International’s case while determining limitation period for filing appeal u/s. 37 did not notice the provisions of the CC Act at all and can be said to be per incuriam on this count - Period of 90 days plus 30 days and not thereafter mentioned in s. 34(3) of the 1996 Act cannot now apply, the limitation period for filing of appeals under the CC Act being 60 days and not 90 days – Thus, N.V.

International’s case while determining limitation period for filing appeal u/s. 37 did not notice the provisions of the CC Act at all and can be said to be per incuriam on this count - Period of 90 days plus 30 days and not thereafter mentioned in s. 34(3) of the 1996 Act cannot now apply, the limitation period for filing of appeals under the CC Act being 60 days and not 90 days – Thus, N.V.

Limitation Act, 1963: s. 5 – Application of s. 5, to appeals u/ s. 37 of the 1996 Act and to s. 13(1A) of the CC Act – Held: s. 37 when read with s. 43 thereof, makes it clear that the provisions of the Limitation Act would apply to appeals filed u/s. 37 – Appeal u/ s. 37 where specified value within the meaning of the CC Act is below 3 lakhs, are governed by Arts. 116 and 117 – Arts. 116 and 117 of the Limitation Act provide for a limitation period of 90 days and 30 days, for appeal to a High Court or an intra-High Court appeal – Thus, s. 5 of the Limitation Act would apply to the said appeals, both by virtue of s. 43 of the 1996 Act and s. 29(2) of the Limitation Act – Arts. 116, 117, s. 29(2) – Commercial Courts Act, 2015. s. 5 – Application of, to appeals u/s. 13(1A) of the CC Act providing a uniform 60-day period of limitation – Held: A middle course to be adopted between the N.V. International’s case which does not allow condonation of delay beyond 30 days, and an open- ended provision in which any amount of delay can be condoned, provided sufficient cause is shown – Maxim ut res magis valeat quam pereat-liberal construction should be put upon written instruments, to be followed – Commercial Courts Act, 2015. Constitution of India – Art. 141 – Binding precedent – N.V. International v. State of Assam’s case applied the provisions of s. 5 of the Limitation Act and held that no condonation of delay could take place beyond 120 days – Whether the hard and fast rule applied by this Court in N.V. International’s case, is correct in law – Held: N.V. International’s case while determining limitation period for filing appeal u/s. 37 did not notice the provisions of the CC Act at all and can be said to be per incuriam on this count - Period of 90 days plus 30 days and not thereafter mentioned in s. 34(3) of the 1996 Act cannot now apply, the limitation period for filing of appeals under the CC Act being 60 days and not 90 days – Thus, N.V.

Limitation Act, 1963: s. 5 – Application of s. 5, to appeals u/ s. 37 of the 1996 Act and to s. 13(1A) of the CC Act – Held: s. 37 when read with s. 43 thereof, makes it clear that the provisions of the Limitation Act would apply to appeals filed u/s. 37 – Appeal u/ s. 37 where specified value within the meaning of the CC Act is below 3 lakhs, are governed by Arts. 116 and 117 – Arts. 116 and 117 of the Limitation Act provide for a limitation period of 90 days and 30 days, for appeal to a High Court or an intra-High Court appeal – Thus, s. 5 of the Limitation Act would apply to the said appeals, both by virtue of s. 43 of the 1996 Act and s. 29(2) of the Limitation Act – Arts. 116, 117, s. 29(2) – Commercial Courts Act, 2015. s. 5 – Application of, to appeals u/s. 13(1A) of the CC Act providing a uniform 60-day period of limitation – Held: A middle course to be adopted between the N.V. International’s case which does not allow condonation of delay beyond 30 days, and an open- ended provision in which any amount of delay can be condoned, provided sufficient cause is shown – Maxim ut res magis valeat quam pereat-liberal construction should be put upon written instruments, to be followed – Commercial Courts Act, 2015. Constitution of India – Art. 141 – Binding precedent – N.V. International v. State of Assam’s case applied the provisions of s. 5 of the Limitation Act and held that no condonation of delay could take place beyond 120 days – Whether the hard and fast rule applied by this Court in N.V. International’s case, is correct in law – Held: N.V. International’s case while determining limitation period for filing appeal u/s. 37 did not notice the provisions of the CC Act at all and can be said to be per incuriam on this count - Period of 90 days plus 30 days and not thereafter mentioned in s. 34(3) of the 1996 Act cannot now apply, the limitation period for filing of appeals under the CC Act being 60 days and not 90 days – Thus, N.V. International’s case has been wrongly decided and is overruled – Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 – ss. 37 and 34(3) – Commercial Courts Act, 2015",

Limitation Act, 1963: s. 5 – Application of s. 5, to appeals u/ s. 37 of the 1996 Act and to s. 13(1A) of the CC Act – Held: s. 37 when read with s. 43 thereof, makes it clear that the provisions of the Limitation Act would apply to appeals filed u/s. 37 – Appeal u/ s. 37 where specified value within the meaning of the CC Act is below 3 lakhs, are governed by Arts. 116 and 117 – Arts. 116 and 117 of the Limitation Act provide for a limitation period of 90 days and 30 days, for appeal to a High Court or an intra-High Court appeal – Thus, s. 5 of the Limitation Act would apply to the said appeals, both by virtue of s. 43 of the 1996 Act and s. 29(2) of the Limitation Act – Arts. 116, 117, s. 29(2) – Commercial Courts Act, 2015. s. 5 – Application of, to appeals u/s. 13(1A) of the CC Act providing a uniform 60-day period of limitation – Held: A middle course to be adopted between the N.V. International’s case which does not allow condonation of delay beyond 30 days, and an open- ended provision in which any amount of delay can be condoned, provided sufficient cause is shown – Maxim ut res magis valeat quam pereat-liberal construction should be put upon written instruments, to be followed – Commercial Courts Act, 2015. Constitution of India – Art. 141 – Binding precedent – N.V. International v. State of Assam’s case applied the provisions of s. 5 of the Limitation Act and held that no condonation of delay could take place beyond 120 days – Whether the hard and fast rule applied by this Court in N.V. International’s case, is correct in law – Held: N.V. International’s case while determining limitation period for filing appeal u/s. 37 did not notice the provisions of the CC Act at all and can be said to be per incuriam on this count - Period of 90 days plus 30 days and not thereafter mentioned in s. 34(3) of the 1996 Act cannot now apply, the limitation period for filing of appeals under the CC Act being 60 days and not 90 days – Thus, N.V.

Limitation Act, 1963: s. 5 – Application of s. 5, to appeals u/ s. 37 of the 1996 Act and to s. 13(1A) of the CC Act – Held: s. 37 when read with s. 43 thereof, makes it clear that the provisions of the Limitation Act would apply to appeals filed u/s. 37 – Appeal u/ s. 37 where specified value within the meaning of the CC Act is below 3 lakhs, are governed by Arts. 116 and 117 – Arts. 116 and 117 of the Limitation Act provide for a limitation period of 90 days and 30 days, for appeal to a High Court or an intra-High Court appeal – Thus, s. 5 of the Limitation Act would apply to the said appeals, both by virtue of s. 43 of the 1996 Act and s. 29(2) of the Limitation Act – Arts. 116, 117, s. 29(2) – Commercial Courts Act, 2015. s. 5 – Application of, to appeals u/s. 13(1A) of the CC Act providing a uniform 60-day period of limitation – Held: A middle course to be adopted between the N.V. International’s case which does not allow condonation of delay beyond 30 days, and an open- ended provision in which any amount of delay can be condoned, provided sufficient cause is shown – Maxim ut res magis valeat quam pereat-liberal construction should be put upon written instruments, to be followed – Commercial Courts Act, 2015. Constitution of India – Art. 141 – Binding precedent – N.V. International v. State of Assam’s case applied the provisions of s. 5 of the Limitation Act and held that no condonation of delay could take place beyond 120 days – Whether the hard and fast rule applied by this Court in N.V. International’s case, is correct in law – Held: N.V. International’s case while determining limitation period for filing appeal u/s. 37 did not notice the provisions of the CC Act at all and can be said to be per incuriam on this count - Period of 90 days plus 30 days and not thereafter mentioned in s. 34(3) of the 1996 Act cannot now apply, the limitation period for filing of appeals under the CC Act being 60 days and not 90 days – Thus, N.V.

Limitation Act, 1963: s. 5 – Application of s. 5, to appeals u/ s. 37 of the 1996 Act and to s. 13(1A) of the CC Act – Held: s. 37 when read with s. 43 thereof, makes it clear that the provisions of the Limitation Act would apply to appeals filed u/s. 37 – Appeal u/ s. 37 where specified value within the meaning of the CC Act is below 3 lakhs, are governed by Arts. 116 and 117 – Arts. 116 and 117 of the Limitation Act provide for a limitation period of 90 days and 30 days, for appeal to a High Court or an intra-High Court appeal – Thus, s. 5 of the Limitation Act would apply to the said appeals, both by virtue of s. 43 of the 1996 Act and s. 29(2) of the Limitation Act – Arts. 116, 117, s. 29(2) – Commercial Courts Act, 2015. s. 5 – Application of, to appeals u/s. 13(1A) of the CC Act providing a uniform 60-day period of limitation – Held: A middle course to be adopted between the N.V. International’s case which does not allow condonation of delay beyond 30 days, and an open- ended provision in which any amount of delay can be condoned, provided sufficient cause is shown – Maxim ut res magis valeat quam pereat-liberal construction should be put upon written instruments, to be followed – Commercial Courts Act, 2015. Constitution of India – Art. 141 – Binding precedent – N.V. International v. State of Assam’s case applied the provisions of s. 5 of the Limitation Act and held that no condonation of delay could take place beyond 120 days – Whether the hard and fast rule applied by this Court in N.V. International’s case, is correct in law – Held: N.V. International’s case while determining limitation period for filing appeal u/s. 37 did not notice the provisions of the CC Act at all and can be said to be per incuriam on this count - Period of 90 days plus 30 days and not thereafter mentioned in s. 34(3) of the 1996 Act cannot now apply, the limitation period for filing of appeals under the CC Act being 60 days and not 90 days – Thus, N.V. International’s case has been wrongly decided and is overruled – Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 – ss. 37 and 34(3) – Commercial Courts Act, 2015",

Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India (Liquidation Process) Regulations, 2016: Reg 2B - Constitutional validity of – Held: Reg 2 B provides that where a compromise or arrangement is proposed u/s. 230 of the Act of 2013, it shall be completed within ninety days of the order of liquidation under sub-Sections (1) and (4) of s. 33 – Proviso to Reg 2B provides that a person who is not eligible under the IBC to submit a resolution plan for insolvency resolution of the corporate debtor shall not be a party in any manner to such compromise or arrangement – Reg 2B, specifically the proviso to Reg 2B(1) is constitutionally valid.Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016: s. 29A – Person not eligible to be resolution applicant – Eligibility of promoter to file application for compromise and arrangement, while he is ineligible u/s. 29A to submit ‘Resolution Plan’ – On facts, application by GNCL, corporate debtor for initiating the Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process admitted and the appellant-promoter of GNCL submitted a resolution plan for GNCL – However, due to insertion of s. 29A, which disqualifies a person from being a resolution applicant if they have been a promoter or in the management or control of a corporate debtor, appellant became ineligible to submit a resolution plan – No resolution plan approved by the CoC and in absence thereof, the order of liquidation by NCLT – During the pendency of the appeal before NCLAT, application u/ss. 230 to 232 of the Act of 2013 by appellant-promoter of GNCL before the NCLT proposing a scheme for compromise and arrangement between the erstwhile promoters and creditors and the same was allowed – Appeal thereagainst by respondent- unsecured creditor of the corporate debtor – NCLAT holding that promoters ineligible u/s. 29A to submit a resolution plan, also barred from proposing a scheme of compromise and arrangement u/s.230 of the Act of 2013 – On appeal, held: Prohibition placed by the Parliament in s. 29A and s. 35(1)(f) must also attach itself to a scheme of compromise or arrangement u/s. 230 of the 2013 Act, when the company is undergoing liquidation under the auspices of the IBC – As such, Reg 2B, specifically the proviso to Reg 2B(1), is also constitutionally valid – Even in the absence of the Reg 2B, a person ineligible u/s. 29A read with s. 35(1)(f) is not permitted to propose a scheme for revival u/s. 230, in the case of a company which is undergoing a liquidation under the IBC – In the case of a company undergoing liquidation under the IBC, a scheme of compromise or arrangement proposed u/s. 230 is a facet of the liquidation process – Object of the scheme of compromise or arrangement is to revive the company – Same rationale which permeates the resolution process u/s. 29A permeates the liquidation process u/s. 35(1)(f) – Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India (Liquidation Process) Regulations, 2016 – Reg 2B – Companies Act, 2013 – ss. 230 to 232. Enactment of – Salutary objectives of good corporate governance and respect for and adherence to the rule of law; and re-organization and resolution of insolvencies under – Held: Can be achieved if the integrity of the resolution process is placed at the forefront – Purposive interpretation is required by the courts, while infusing meaning and content to its provisions, to ensure that the problems which beset the earlier regime do not enter through the backdoor through disingenuous stratagems. s. 29A – Person not eligible to be resolution applicant – Purpose of the ineligibility under – Held: Is to achieve a sustainable revival and to ensure that a person who is the cause of the problem either by a design or a default cannot be a part of the process of solution – s. 29A encompasses not only conduct in relation to the corporate debtor but in relation to other companies as well. ss. 29A, 35(1)(f) – Interplay between the proposal of a scheme of compromise and arrangement u/s.230 of the Act of 2013 and liquidation proceedings initiated under IBC – Held: s. 230 of the Act of 2013 is wider in its ambit – It is not confined only to a company in liquidation or to corporate debtor which is being wound up under Chapter III of the IBC – Thus, the rigors of the IBC will not apply to proceedings u/s. 230 of the Act of 2013 where the scheme of compromise or arrangement proposed is in relation to an entity which is not the subject of a proceeding under the IBC – However, where s. 230 of the Act of 2013 traces its origin to the liquidation proceedings initiated under IBC, harmonious construction is needed between the two statutes which would ensure that a scheme of compromise or arrangement u/s. 230 is being pursued, in a manner consistent with the underlying principles of the IBC – It would lead to a manifest absurdity if the very persons who are ineligible for submitting a resolution plan, participating in the sale of assets of the company in liquidation, are somehow permitted to propose a compromise or arrangement u/s. 230 of the Act of 2013 – IBC has made a provision for ineligibility u/s. 29A which operates during the course of the CIRP – Similar provision, s. 35(1)(f) forms a part of the liquidation provisions contained in Chapter III as well – In the context of the statutory linkage provided by the provisions of s. 230 of the Act of 2013 with Chapter III of the IBC, it would be far- fetched to hold that the ineligibilities which attach u/s. 35(1)(f) r/w s. 29A would not apply when s. 230 is sought to be invoked – Such an interpretation would result in defeating the provisions of the IBC and must be eschewed – Stages of submitting a resolution plan, selling assets of a company in liquidation and selling the company as a going concern during liquidation, all indicate that the promoter or those in the management of the company must not be allowed a back-door entry in the company and are hence, ineligible to participate during these stages – Proposing a scheme of compromise or arrangement u/s. 230 of the Act of 2013, while the company is undergoing liquidation under the provisions of the IBC lies in a similar continuum – Companies Act, 2013 – ss. 230 to 232. ss. 6 to 32A – Modes of revival of a company under the provisions of the IBC – Explained.",

Enactment of – Salutary objectives of good corporate governance and respect for and adherence to the rule of law; and re-organization and resolution of insolvencies under – Held: Can be achieved if the integrity of the resolution process is placed at the forefront – Purposive interpretation is required by the courts, while infusing meaning and content to its provisions, to ensure that the problems which beset the earlier regime do not enter through the backdoor through disingenuous stratagems. s. 29A – Person not eligible to be resolution applicant – Purpose of the ineligibility under – Held: Is to achieve a sustainable revival and to ensure that a person who is the cause of the problem either by a design or a default cannot be a part of the process of solution – s. 29A encompasses not only conduct in relation to the corporate debtor but in relation to other companies as well. ss. 29A, 35(1)(f) – Interplay between the proposal of a scheme of compromise and arrangement u/s.230 of the Act of 2013 and liquidation proceedings initiated under IBC – Held: s. 230 of the Act of 2013 is wider in its ambit – It is not confined only to a company in liquidation or to corporate debtor which is being wound up under Chapter III of the IBC – Thus, the rigors of the IBC will not apply to proceedings u/s. 230 of the Act of 2013 where the scheme of compromise or arrangement proposed is in relation to an entity which is not the subject of a proceeding under the IBC – However, where s. 230 of the Act of 2013 traces its origin to the liquidation proceedings initiated under IBC, harmonious construction is needed between the two statutes which would ensure that a scheme of compromise or arrangement u/s. 230 is being pursued, in a manner consistent with the underlying principles of the IBC – It would lead to a manifest absurdity if the very persons who are ineligible for submitting a resolution plan, participating in the sale of assets of the company in liquidation, are somehow permitted to propose a compromise or arrangement u/s. 230 of the Act of 2013 – IBC has made a provision for ineligibility u/s. 29A which operates during the course of the CIRP – Similar provision, s. 35(1)(f) forms a part of the liquidation provisions contained in Chapter III as well – In the context of the statutory linkage provided by the provisions of s. 230 of the Act of 2013 with Chapter III of the IBC, it would be far- fetched to hold that the ineligibilities which attach u/s. 35(1)(f) r/w s. 29A would not apply when s. 230 is sought to be invoked – Such an interpretation would result in defeating the provisions of the IBC and must be eschewed – Stages of submitting a resolution plan, selling assets of a company in liquidation and selling the company as a going concern during liquidation, all indicate that the promoter or those in the management of the company must not be allowed a back-door entry in the company and are hence, ineligible to participate during these stages – Proposing a scheme of compromise or arrangement u/s. 230 of the Act of 2013, while the company is undergoing liquidation under the provisions of the IBC lies in a similar continuum – Companies Act, 2013 – ss. 230 to 232. ss. 6 to 32A – Modes of revival of a company under the provisions of the IBC – Explained.",

Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India (Liquidation Process) Regulations, 2016: Reg 2B - Constitutional validity of – Held: Reg 2 B provides that where a compromise or arrangement is proposed u/s. 230 of the Act of 2013, it shall be completed within ninety days of the order of liquidation under sub-Sections (1) and (4) of s. 33 – Proviso to Reg 2B provides that a person who is not eligible under the IBC to submit a resolution plan for insolvency resolution of the corporate debtor shall not be a party in any manner to such compromise or arrangement – Reg 2B, specifically the proviso to Reg 2B(1) is constitutionally valid.Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016: s. 29A – Person not eligible to be resolution applicant – Eligibility of promoter to file application for compromise and arrangement, while he is ineligible u/s. 29A to submit ‘Resolution Plan’ – On facts, application by GNCL, corporate debtor for initiating the Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process admitted and the appellant-promoter of GNCL submitted a resolution plan for GNCL – However, due to insertion of s. 29A, which disqualifies a person from being a resolution applicant if they have been a promoter or in the management or control of a corporate debtor, appellant became ineligible to submit a resolution plan – No resolution plan approved by the CoC and in absence thereof, the order of liquidation by NCLT – During the pendency of the appeal before NCLAT, application u/ss. 230 to 232 of the Act of 2013 by appellant-promoter of GNCL before the NCLT proposing a scheme for compromise and arrangement between the erstwhile promoters and creditors and the same was allowed – Appeal thereagainst by respondent- unsecured creditor of the corporate debtor – NCLAT holding that promoters ineligible u/s. 29A to submit a resolution plan, also barred from proposing a scheme of compromise and arrangement u/s.230 of the Act of 2013 – On appeal, held: Prohibition placed by the Parliament in s. 29A and s. 35(1)(f) must also attach itself to a scheme of compromise or arrangement u/s. 230 of the 2013 Act, when the company is undergoing liquidation under the auspices of the IBC – As such, Reg 2B, specifically the proviso to Reg 2B(1), is also constitutionally valid – Even in the absence of the Reg 2B, a person ineligible u/s. 29A read with s. 35(1)(f) is not permitted to propose a scheme for revival u/s. 230, in the case of a company which is undergoing a liquidation under the IBC – In the case of a company undergoing liquidation under the IBC, a scheme of compromise or arrangement proposed u/s. 230 is a facet of the liquidation process – Object of the scheme of compromise or arrangement is to revive the company – Same rationale which permeates the resolution process u/s. 29A permeates the liquidation process u/s. 35(1)(f) – Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India (Liquidation Process) Regulations, 2016 – Reg 2B – Companies Act, 2013 – ss. 230 to 232. Enactment of – Salutary objectives of good corporate governance and respect for and adherence to the rule of law; and re-organization and resolution of insolvencies under – Held: Can be achieved if the integrity of the resolution process is placed at the forefront – Purposive interpretation is required by the courts, while infusing meaning and content to its provisions, to ensure that the problems which beset the earlier regime do not enter through the backdoor through disingenuous stratagems. s. 29A – Person not eligible to be resolution applicant – Purpose of the ineligibility under – Held: Is to achieve a sustainable revival and to ensure that a person who is the cause of the problem either by a design or a default cannot be a part of the process of solution – s. 29A encompasses not only conduct in relation to the corporate debtor but in relation to other companies as well. ss. 29A, 35(1)(f) – Interplay between the proposal of a scheme of compromise and arrangement u/s.230 of the Act of 2013 and liquidation proceedings initiated under IBC – Held: s. 230 of the Act of 2013 is wider in its ambit – It is not confined only to a company in liquidation or to corporate debtor which is being wound up under Chapter III of the IBC – Thus, the rigors of the IBC will not apply to proceedings u/s. 230 of the Act of 2013 where the scheme of compromise or arrangement proposed is in relation to an entity which is not the subject of a proceeding under the IBC – However, where s. 230 of the Act of 2013 traces its origin to the liquidation proceedings initiated under IBC, harmonious construction is needed between the two statutes which would ensure that a scheme of compromise or arrangement u/s. 230 is being pursued, in a manner consistent with the underlying principles of the IBC – It would lead to a manifest absurdity if the very persons who are ineligible for submitting a resolution plan, participating in the sale of assets of the company in liquidation, are somehow permitted to propose a compromise or arrangement u/s. 230 of the Act of 2013 – IBC has made a provision for ineligibility u/s. 29A which operates during the course of the CIRP – Similar provision, s. 35(1)(f) forms a part of the liquidation provisions contained in Chapter III as well – In the context of the statutory linkage provided by the provisions of s. 230 of the Act of 2013 with Chapter III of the IBC, it would be far- fetched to hold that the ineligibilities which attach u/s. 35(1)(f) r/w s. 29A would not apply when s. 230 is sought to be invoked – Such an interpretation would result in defeating the provisions of the IBC and must be eschewed – Stages of submitting a resolution plan, selling assets of a company in liquidation and selling the company as a going concern during liquidation, all indicate that the promoter or those in the management of the company must not be allowed a back-door entry in the company and are hence, ineligible to participate during these stages – Proposing a scheme of compromise or arrangement u/s. 230 of the Act of 2013, while the company is undergoing liquidation under the provisions of the IBC lies in a similar continuum – Companies Act, 2013 – ss. 230 to 232. ss. 6 to 32A – Modes of revival of a company under the provisions of the IBC – Explained.",

Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India (Liquidation Process) Regulations, 2016: Reg 2B - Constitutional validity of – Held: Reg 2 B provides that where a compromise or arrangement is proposed u/s. 230 of the Act of 2013, it shall be completed within ninety days of the order of liquidation under sub-Sections (1) and (4) of s. 33 – Proviso to Reg 2B provides that a person who is not eligible under the IBC to submit a resolution plan for insolvency resolution of the corporate debtor shall not be a party in any manner to such compromise or arrangement – Reg 2B, specifically the proviso to Reg 2B(1) is constitutionally valid.Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016: s. 29A – Person not eligible to be resolution applicant – Eligibility of promoter to file application for compromise and arrangement, while he is ineligible u/s. 29A to submit ‘Resolution Plan’ – On facts, application by GNCL, corporate debtor for initiating the Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process admitted and the appellant-promoter of GNCL submitted a resolution plan for GNCL – However, due to insertion of s. 29A, which disqualifies a person from being a resolution applicant if they have been a promoter or in the management or control of a corporate debtor, appellant became ineligible to submit a resolution plan – No resolution plan approved by the CoC and in absence thereof, the order of liquidation by NCLT – During the pendency of the appeal before NCLAT, application u/ss. 230 to 232 of the Act of 2013 by appellant-promoter of GNCL before the NCLT proposing a scheme for compromise and arrangement between the erstwhile promoters and creditors and the same was allowed – Appeal thereagainst by respondent- unsecured creditor of the corporate debtor – NCLAT holding that promoters ineligible u/s. 29A to submit a resolution plan, also barred from proposing a scheme of compromise and arrangement u/s.230 of the Act of 2013 – On appeal, held: Prohibition placed by the Parliament in s. 29A and s. 35(1)(f) must also attach itself to a scheme of compromise or arrangement u/s. 230 of the 2013 Act, when the company is undergoing liquidation under the auspices of the IBC – As such, Reg 2B, specifically the proviso to Reg 2B(1), is also constitutionally valid – Even in the absence of the Reg 2B, a person ineligible u/s. 29A read with s. 35(1)(f) is not permitted to propose a scheme for revival u/s. 230, in the case of a company which is undergoing a liquidation under the IBC – In the case of a company undergoing liquidation under the IBC, a scheme of compromise or arrangement proposed u/s. 230 is a facet of the liquidation process – Object of the scheme of compromise or arrangement is to revive the company – Same rationale which permeates the resolution process u/s. 29A permeates the liquidation process u/s. 35(1)(f) – Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India (Liquidation Process) Regulations, 2016 – Reg 2B – Companies Act, 2013 – ss. 230 to 232. Enactment of – Salutary objectives of good corporate governance and respect for and adherence to the rule of law; and re-organization and resolution of insolvencies under – Held: Can be achieved if the integrity of the resolution process is placed at the forefront – Purposive interpretation is required by the courts, while infusing meaning and content to its provisions, to ensure that the problems which beset the earlier regime do not enter through the backdoor through disingenuous stratagems. s. 29A – Person not eligible to be resolution applicant – Purpose of the ineligibility under – Held: Is to achieve a sustainable revival and to ensure that a person who is the cause of the problem either by a design or a default cannot be a part of the process of solution – s. 29A encompasses not only conduct in relation to the corporate debtor but in relation to other companies as well. ss. 29A, 35(1)(f) – Interplay between the proposal of a scheme of compromise and arrangement u/s.230 of the Act of 2013 and liquidation proceedings initiated under IBC – Held: s. 230 of the Act of 2013 is wider in its ambit – It is not confined only to a company in liquidation or to corporate debtor which is being wound up under Chapter III of the IBC – Thus, the rigors of the IBC will not apply to proceedings u/s. 230 of the Act of 2013 where the scheme of compromise or arrangement proposed is in relation to an entity which is not the subject of a proceeding under the IBC – However, where s. 230 of the Act of 2013 traces its origin to the liquidation proceedings initiated under IBC, harmonious construction is needed between the two statutes which would ensure that a scheme of compromise or arrangement u/s. 230 is being pursued, in a manner consistent with the underlying principles of the IBC – It would lead to a manifest absurdity if the very persons who are ineligible for submitting a resolution plan, participating in the sale of assets of the company in liquidation, are somehow permitted to propose a compromise or arrangement u/s. 230 of the Act of 2013 – IBC has made a provision for ineligibility u/s. 29A which operates during the course of the CIRP – Similar provision, s. 35(1)(f) forms a part of the liquidation provisions contained in Chapter III as well – In the context of the statutory linkage provided by the provisions of s. 230 of the Act of 2013 with Chapter III of the IBC, it would be far- fetched to hold that the ineligibilities which attach u/s. 35(1)(f) r/w s. 29A would not apply when s. 230 is sought to be invoked – Such an interpretation would result in defeating the provisions of the IBC and must be eschewed – Stages of submitting a resolution plan, selling assets of a company in liquidation and selling the company as a going concern during liquidation, all indicate that the promoter or those in the management of the company must not be allowed a back-door entry in the company and are hence, ineligible to participate during these stages – Proposing a scheme of compromise or arrangement u/s. 230 of the Act of 2013, while the company is undergoing liquidation under the provisions of the IBC lies in a similar continuum – Companies Act, 2013 – ss. 230 to 232. ss. 6 to 32A – Modes of revival of a company under the provisions of the IBC – Explained.",

Enactment of – Salutary objectives of good corporate governance and respect for and adherence to the rule of law; and re-organization and resolution of insolvencies under – Held: Can be achieved if the integrity of the resolution process is placed at the forefront – Purposive interpretation is required by the courts, while infusing meaning and content to its provisions, to ensure that the problems which beset the earlier regime do not enter through the backdoor through disingenuous stratagems. s. 29A – Person not eligible to be resolution applicant – Purpose of the ineligibility under – Held: Is to achieve a sustainable revival and to ensure that a person who is the cause of the problem either by a design or a default cannot be a part of the process of solution – s. 29A encompasses not only conduct in relation to the corporate debtor but in relation to other companies as well. ss. 29A, 35(1)(f) – Interplay between the proposal of a scheme of compromise and arrangement u/s.230 of the Act of 2013 and liquidation proceedings initiated under IBC – Held: s. 230 of the Act of 2013 is wider in its ambit – It is not confined only to a company in liquidation or to corporate debtor which is being wound up under Chapter III of the IBC – Thus, the rigors of the IBC will not apply to proceedings u/s. 230 of the Act of 2013 where the scheme of compromise or arrangement proposed is in relation to an entity which is not the subject of a proceeding under the IBC – However, where s. 230 of the Act of 2013 traces its origin to the liquidation proceedings initiated under IBC, harmonious construction is needed between the two statutes which would ensure that a scheme of compromise or arrangement u/s. 230 is being pursued, in a manner consistent with the underlying principles of the IBC – It would lead to a manifest absurdity if the very persons who are ineligible for submitting a resolution plan, participating in the sale of assets of the company in liquidation, are somehow permitted to propose a compromise or arrangement u/s. 230 of the Act of 2013 – IBC has made a provision for ineligibility u/s. 29A which operates during the course of the CIRP – Similar provision, s. 35(1)(f) forms a part of the liquidation provisions contained in Chapter III as well – In the context of the statutory linkage provided by the provisions of s. 230 of the Act of 2013 with Chapter III of the IBC, it would be far- fetched to hold that the ineligibilities which attach u/s. 35(1)(f) r/w s. 29A would not apply when s. 230 is sought to be invoked – Such an interpretation would result in defeating the provisions of the IBC and must be eschewed – Stages of submitting a resolution plan, selling assets of a company in liquidation and selling the company as a going concern during liquidation, all indicate that the promoter or those in the management of the company must not be allowed a back-door entry in the company and are hence, ineligible to participate during these stages – Proposing a scheme of compromise or arrangement u/s. 230 of the Act of 2013, while the company is undergoing liquidation under the provisions of the IBC lies in a similar continuum – Companies Act, 2013 – ss. 230 to 232. ss. 6 to 32A – Modes of revival of a company under the provisions of the IBC – Explained.",
