Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973: s.439 – Bail – Consideration of bail application in economic offence – Held: Even economic offences fall under the category of “grave offence”, in view of the consequences that would befall on the society in cases of financial irregularities, and in such circumstance while considering the application for bail in such matters, the Court has to deal with the same, being sensitive to the nature of allegation made against the accused – One of the circumstances to consider the gravity of the offence is the term of sentence that is prescribed for the offence the accused is alleged to have committed – Such consideration with regard to the gravity of offence is a factor which is in addition to the triple test or the tripod test that would be normally applied – However, it is not a rule that bail should be denied in every case of economic offence since there is no such bar created in the relevant enactment passed by the legislature nor does the bail jurisprudence provides so – The consideration will have to be on case to case basis on the facts involved therein and securing the presence of the accused to stand trial."

Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973: s.439 – Bail – Grant/ Rejection of bail – Determining factors – Held: The determination of whether a case is fit for the grant of bail involves the balancing of numerous factors, among which the nature of the offence, the severity of the punishment and a prima facie view of the involvement of the accused are important – No straight jacket formula exists for courts to assess an application for the grant or rejection of bail – At the stage of assessing whether a case is fit for the grant of bail, the court is not required to enter into a detailed analysis of the evidence on record to establish beyond reasonable doubt the commission of the crime by the accused – That is a matter for trial – However, the Court is required to examine whether there is a prima facie or reasonable ground to believe that the accused had committed the offence and on a balance of the considerations involved, the continued custody of the accused sub-serves the purpose of the criminal justice system. Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973: s.439 – Bail – Where bail has been granted by a lower court – Scope of interference – Held: Appellate court must be slow to interfere and ought to be guided by the principles set out for the exercise of the power to set aside bail. Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973: s.439 – Bail – Power of an appellate court in assessing the correctness of an order granting bail vis-a-vis application for the cancellation of bail – Determining factors – Held: The considerations that guide the power of an appellate court in assessing the correctness of an order granting bail stand on a different footing from an assessment of an application for the cancellation of bail – The correctness of an order granting bail is tested on the anvil of whether there was an improper or arbitrary exercise of the discretion in the grant of bail – The test is whether the order granting bail is perverse, illegal or unjustified – On the other hand, an application for cancellation of bail is generally examined on the anvil of the existence of supervening circumstances or violations of the conditions of bail by a person to whom bail has been granted.

No. 242 dated 22.7.2013 – G.O. No. 242 was also challenged in Writ Petition – Disposing of the writ petitions and writ appeals, Division Bench of High Court held that reduction in pay-scale was without following principle of natural justice hence directed the State to constitute a ‘Pay Grievance Redressal Committee’ to analyse and consider the case – Appeal by the employees as well as the State to Supreme Court – Held: Recommendations of the One Man Commission were found to be anomalous – If the State government constituted the PGRC to address those anomalies, such decision by itself cannot be found to be illegal or invalid – Prescription of pay-scale and assessment in that behalf being a complex matter need to be assessed by experts– Therefore, there is no error in the impugned order directing constitution of PGRC.

Service Law: Pension – Invalid pension – Entitlement for – Pension is earned by stint of continuity and longevity of service and minimum qualifying service should, therefore, be understood as the requirement for invalid pension as well – Pension Rules can be harmoniously construed in this manner and in that event, there shall be no clash between different provisions in the said Rules – The condition of qualifying service prescribed in the Pension Rules must be satisfied to become eligible for invalid pension – For those with less than 10 years’ service, the Pension Rules provide for gratuity payment and therefore, for invalid pension, qualifying years of service, cannot be ignored – The different provisions of the Pension Rules cannot be read in isolation and must be construed harmoniously and the requirement of qualifying service cannot be said to be irrelevant for claiming different service benefits under the same Rules – Service law – Orissa Civil Services (Pension) Rules, 1992. Interpretation of statutes: Harmonious construction – Pension Rules – Construction of – When the question arises as to how certain provisions of the Pension Rules are to be understood, it is appropriate to read the provision in its context which would mean reading the statute as a whole – In other words, a particular provision of the statute should be construed with reference to other provisions of the same statute so as to construe the enactment as a whole – An interpretation which involve conflict with two provisions of the same statute should be avoided and effort should be made for harmonious construction – The provision of a Rule cannot be used to defeat another Rule unless it is impossible to effect reconciliation between them – Orissa Civil Services (Pension) Rules, 1992.

Prevention of Food Adulteration Act, 1954: s.11 – Prior notice to the accused – Held: Under the scheme of the 1954 Act, the accused has to be given prior notice, as provided under s.11, that samples of a food article manufactured and/or sold by them have been sent for analysis, before the Public Analyst prepares report – The 1954 Act does not envisage a situation such as the present case where the sample is sent for analysis, and the Public Analyst’s report is also prepared, but the marketer is informed several years later that prosecution is sought to be instituted against them – During such period, the food article being perishable in nature would most probably be incapable of being sent for re-testing to the Central Laboratory. Prevention of Food Adulteration Act, 1954: s.13(1) to (3) – Whether denial of right to get Jelly sample tested by the Central Laboratory under s.13(2) of the 1954 Act would entitled quashing of proceedings against the appellant for the offence of misbranding – What is the procedure to be followed in cases where proving misbranding requires testing of the relevant food samples but the corresponding charge of adulteration has not been made – Held: It is absurd and discriminatory for the prosecution to, on one hand, rely on the report of the Public Analyst under s.13(1) for proving the offence of ‘misbranding’, and on the other hand, claim that the accused cannot avail of their right to challenge the said report as per ss.13(2) and 13(3) because it is not a case of ‘adulteration’ – In such a scenario, the word ‘adulterated’ in s.13(2) would have to be read as including ‘misbranded’ in so far as it relates to the ingredients of the concerned food article, and the relevant clauses of s.13 have to be complied with in their entirety – Therefore, where examination of the contents/ingredients of the food article is integral to proving the offence ‘misbranding’, the procedure prescribed under ss.11 to 13 of the 1954 Act has to be complied with, regardless of whether ‘adulteration’ is alleged or not – This includes the right to obtain a second opinion from the Central Laboratory under s.13(2) – The same test would apply in respect of any other offence for which penalty is prescribed under the 1954 Act – Interpretation of Statutes.

Interpretation of Statutes: Ambiguity in a penal statute – It is settled principle of statutory interpretation that any ambiguity in a penal statute has to be interpreted in favour of the accused. ",
