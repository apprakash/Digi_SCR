Constitution of India – Article 243-ZA(1), 324(1) – Held: The language and tenor of Article 243-ZA(1) is in pari materia with Article 324(1) – Interpretation of Article 324(1) to confer wide powers on the Election Commission to issue directions in respect of elections to Parliament and State legislatures would apply to Article 243- ZA(1) which has to be construed to confer powers on the State Election Commission to issue directions related to superintendence, direction and control of the preparation of electoral roles or for conduct of elections to municipalities – State Election Commission has the same powers u/Article 243-K and 243-ZA(1) as the Election Commission has u/Article 324(1). Karnataka Municipal Corporations Act, 1976 – Karnataka Municipal Corporation (Election) Rules, 1979 – Representation of People Act, 1951 – Conduct of Elections Rules, 1961 – Held: A hypertechnical view of the omission to incorporate any specific provision in the KMC Election Rules, similar to the 1961 Rules, expressly requiring disclosure of assets, to condone dishonesty and corrupt practice would be against the spirit of the Constitution and public interest. Precedent – Held: A judgment is a precedent for the issue of law raised and decided – Judgment has to be construed in the backdrop of the facts and circumstances in which it has been rendered.",

        "HeadNote": "Wakfs – Wakf Act, 1995 – Bombay Public Trust Act, 1950 – Public Trust vis-à-vis Wakf – Distinction between a public Trust and a Wakf – Discussed – Held: What was once a Wakf before the 1950 Act, if it is registered under the 1950 Act, with the commencement of the Act, such a public Trust would necessarily come under the ambit of the Wakf Act, 1995 – There are public Trusts registered under the 1950 Act which are in fact, Wakf which fall under s.28 of the 1950 Act – They must come within the regime of the Central Act viz., the Wakf Act, 1995 – Conversely, a Muslim Public Trust registered under the 1950 Act need not be a Wakf under the Act – It would be certainly contrary to the unbroken line of Supreme Court judgments which contemplate such a division between two categories to paint all Muslim public Trusts with the same brush and glean them as Wakfs – While it is open to a Muslim to create a Wakf and ordinarily, there would be the prospect of a reward for dedicating property by way of Wakf, it would be entirely left to a Muslim to take a decision as to whether he should adopt the device provided by an English Trust or make the familiar dedication by way of Wakf – As to whether an institution is a Wakf or a public Trust is a mixed question of fact and law – This means it becomes a duty of whosoever upon whom the duty falls, to ascertain whether it is either and to carefully attend to the terms of the document by which the Trust is evidenced if there is such a document and find the facts and thereafter the law must be applied – It is a matter to be tested on a conspectus of various features and after complying with the law as to whether what is registered as a public Trust is, in fact, a Wakf or not – All public Trusts which have been registered by way of a deeming provision u/s.28 of the 1950 Act will necessarily have to be treated as Wakfs – This is on the principle that once a Wakf is created unless it be a case where the title is extinguished by way of .exercise of power of eminent domain by the State, the title of the Almighty though by implication cannot cease. Wakf Act, 1995 – Wakf – Constituent elements of – Held: The first indispensable requirement is that there must be dedication – Dedication must be by a person who is the owner of the property – Dedication must be permanent – Permanent means that it cannot be for a period of time; it must be perpetual – A Wakf can be created by a Will also – When a Wakf is created by a Will it is open to the Wakif to revoke the will prior to his death – Save as aforesaid, a Wakf cannot be revoked – A Wakf, again meaning the property which is the subject matter of a Wakf cannot be alienated – The object of the Wakf must be such that it is approved by the Muslim law – The object must be religious, pious or charitable – It is not a concept of piety religiousness or the charitable nature in the eyes of the entire world but what is in consonance with Muslim law – There is no prescribed mode of dedication – A Wakf need not be in writing – As far as declaration is concerned, it can be inferred from conduct – A Wakf, as defined includes Wakf by user – A Wakf can be created for attaining a public utility – The public utility must, however, be for an object sanctioned by Muslim law – Subject to said conditions, irrespective of whether the beneficiaries are Muslims or not, there could be a valid Wakf . Wakf Act, 1995 – s.4 – Survey under the Act – Held: The making of survey is not a mere administrative act but it is to be informed by a quasi-judicial inquiry – Also, the surveyor has the power to find whether a particular institution is a Wakf. Constitution of India, 1950 – Art. 226 – Power under – Exercise of – Effect of alternate remedy – Held: Article 226 confers a jurisdiction or a power on the High Courts – It is a power under the Constitution – While a statute may provide for an alternate forum to which the High Court may relegate the party in an appropriate case, the existence of an alternate remedy by itself cannot exclude the jurisdiction of the High Court under the Constitution.",

        "HeadNote": " Constitution of India – Judicial Review – Foreign funded project – Bullet Train Project – Interference by High Court in Tender Process – When not justified – Appellant, a government company issued a tender notice calling for bids for works in relation to the project of construction of Mumbai-Ahmedabad High Speed Rail (Project) – Bids submitted by the respondent along with four other bidders were declared unsuccessful at Technical Stage – High Court allowed the writ petition filed by the respondent and quashed the communications dated 27.04.2021 and 28.04.2021 and the notification dated 28.04.2021 by which the technical Bid submitted by the respondents was rejected on the ground that the same is nonresponsive – Whether w.r.t such a foreign funded project, the High Court was justified in interfering with the tender process in absence of any specific allegations of mala fides and/or favouritism – Held: High Court ought to have appreciated that the Bullet Train Project is a result of long-drawn deliberations between the Government of India and the Government of Japan – A loan agreement came to be executed between the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) and Hon’ble the President of India – JICA agreed to fund approximately Rs.1 lakh crores for the project on the terms and conditions mentioned in the loan agreement and the other agreed terms including the terms and conditions of the Bid document finalized by the JICA/JICC (Japan International Consultants Consortium) – The Bidding Documents are based on JICA’s Standard Bidding Documents as well as based on its procurement guidelines, which form an integral part of the loan agreement – Therefore, any decision contrary to the terms and conditions of the Bidding Document would be altering the terms and conditions of the loan agreement, which would not be permissible – JICA has a vital role to play in such contracts – The foreign funded investment such as the present investment in the form of concessional Official Development Assistance (ODA) loan by the JICA are made on the basis of non- negotiated terms and conditions where the sole discretion as to what will be the conditions of investment and on what terms the contractors would be chosen to implement the project vests with the investor- foreign developed nation – The ultimate decision vests on the concerned parties, who financed/invested in the project, i.e., in the present case JICA – The decision to hold that the Bid was not responsive was of JICC – Under the contractual mechanism,the appellant had no authority to deviate from the evaluation done by JICC – Appellant acted as per the decision of the JICC concurred by JICA – The JICC and JICA can be said to be the final authority and no contrary decision to the decision of the JICC/JICA could have been taken by the appellant, more particularly, with respect to the Bidding Process etc. – Further, the bidding procedure adopted was transparent, fair and does not suffer from any arbitrariness – As such there were no allegations of mala fides and/or favouritism either against the appellant or against JICC and/or JICA – High Court erred in interfering with the conscious decision taken by the JICA/JICC, followed by the appellant – It erred in holding that the Bid submitted by the respondent was in substantial compliance and in interfering with the tender process and with the decision of the JICC/JICA rejecting the Bid submitted by the original writ petitioner at technical stage – Impugned judgment passed by the High Court is quashed and set aside – Contracts. Contracts – Foreign Funded Contracts – Constitution of India – Judicial Review – Scope of – Held: Scope of judicial review in foreign funded contract should be far much less than the ordinary Government funded contracts funded from Consolidated Fund of India – The scope of judicial review in such foreign funded contracts/projects would be restricted and minimal – In such foreign funded contracts, the only ground for judicial review ought to be on a limited aspect, i.e., the action of the executing authority does not suffer from favouritism or nepotism and based on the grounds which have been concealed from the foreign financing authority, if disclosed, would have persuaded the financing authority to cancel the contract.

        "HeadNote": "Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code 2016 – s.7(5)(a) – Interpretation of – Legislature has in its wisdom used the word ‘may’ in s.7(5)(a) of the Code in respect of an application for CIRP initiated by a financial creditor against a Corporate Debtor – It confers discretionary power on the Adjudicating Authority (NCLT) to admit an application of a Financial Creditor u/s.7 of the Code for initiation of CIRP – The existence of a financial debt and default in payment only give the financial creditor the right to apply for initiation of CIRP – NCLT is required to apply its mind to relevant factors – Electricity. Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016: s.7(5)(a) – Whether discretionary or mandatory – Held: Is discretionary. Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016: Difference between s.7(5)(a) and s.9(5)(a) – Discussed – Legislature used ‘may’ in s.7(5)(a) of the IBC but a different word ‘shall’ in the otherwise almost identical provision of s.9(5)(a) shows that ‘may’ and ‘shall’ in the two provisions are intended to convey a different meaning – Legislature intended s.9(5)(a) of the IBC to be mandatory and s.7(5)(a) of the IBC to be discretionary – An application of an Operational Creditor for initiation of CIRP u/s.9(2) of the IBC is mandatorily required to be admitted if the application is complete in all respects and in compliance of the requisites of the IBC. Words and Phrases: May and Shall – Presumption of Fact and Presumption of Law – Discussed – Ordinarily the word “may” is directory – The expression ‘may admit’ confers discretion to admit – The use of the word “shall” postulates a mandatory requirement – The use of the word “shall” raises a presumption that a provision is imperative – The prima facie presumption about the provision being imperative may be rebutted by other considerations such as the scope of the enactment and the consequences flowing from the construction. Interpretation of Statutes: Rules of interpretation – First and foremost principle of interpretation of a statute is the rule of literal interpretation – Purposive interpretation can only be resorted to when the plain words of a statute are ambiguous or if construed literally, the provision would nullify the object of the statute or otherwise lead to an absurd result.

Constitution of India – Articles 14, 15 and 16 – Substantive equality of opportunity– Held: It becomes necessary for the Government to adopt policies through which it produces substantive equality of opportunity as distinct from a formal equality for women in the workplace – The true aim of achieving substantive equality must be fulfilled by the State in recognizing the persistent patterns of discrimination against women once they are in the work place – Therefore, the State, both in its role as a model employer as well as an institution which is subject to constitutional norms, must bear in mind the fundamental right to substantive equality when it crafts the policy even for its own employees – Service Law. Service Law – Transfer Policy – Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016 – Held: It is a statutory mandate for recognizing the principle of reasonable accommodation for the disabled members of society – The formulation of a policy therefore, must take into account the mandate which Parliament imposes as an intrinsic element of the right of the disabled to live with dignity.

        "HeadNote": "Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 – s.29A(h) (as amended by the Act 26 of 2018) – Interpretation and scope of – Held: s.29A(h) creates one more category of persons not being eligible to be a resolution applicant – Other than the persons mentioned thereunder, there may not be any disqualification – The word “person” is of a wider import to include a promoter or a director, as the case may be – The definition of “person” as mentioned u/s.3(23) of the Code includes certain categories of persons and thus, there is no such exclusion – It is merely illustrative/ inclusive in nature and therefore, the persons mentioned in s.29A alone are ineligible to be resolution applicants – Once a person executes a guarantee in favour of a creditor with respect to the credit facilities availed by a corporate debtor, and in a case where an application for insolvency resolution has been admitted, with the further fact of the said guarantee having been invoked, the bar qua eligibility would certainly come into play – What the provision requires is a guarantee in favour of ‘a creditor’ – Once an application for insolvency resolution is admitted on behalf of ‘a creditor’ then the process would be one of rem, and therefore, all creditors of the same class would have their respective rights at par with each other – The word “such creditor” in s.29A(h) has to be interpreted to mean similarly placed creditors after the application for insolvency application is admitted by the adjudicating authority – As a result, what is required to earn a disqualification under the said provision is a mere existence of a personal guarantee that stands invoked by a single creditor, notwithstanding the application being filed by any other creditor seeking initiation of insolvency resolution process, subject to further compliance of invocation of the said personal guarantee by any other creditor – Ineligibility has to be seen from the point of view of the resolution process – It can never be said that there can be ineligibility qua one creditor as against others – The ineligibility is to the participation in the resolution process of the corporate debtor – Exclusion is meant to facilitate a fair and transparent process – The provision after the amendment speaks of invocation by a creditor – The manner of invocation can never be a factor for the adjudicating authority to adjudge, as against its existence – Adequate importance will have to be given to the latter part of the provision which also disqualifies a person whose liability under the personal guarantee executed in favour of a creditor, remains unpaid in full or in part for the amount due from him, upon invocation – s.29A has a laudable object of protecting and balancing the interest of the committee of creditors and the corporate debtor, while shutting the doors to canvas the interests of others – It consciously excludes certain categories of persons – s.29A(h) foresees the creditors who are otherwise either already under the insolvency resolution process or are entitled to go under it – Interpretation of Statutes – Purposive Interpretation. Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 – Object of – Discussed. Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 – s.29A – Objective of – Discussed. Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 – s.29A(h) (as amended by the Act 26 of 2018) – Date of reckoning – Whether the date of submission of resolution plan or the date of adjudication by the authority – Held: If there is a bar at the time of submission of resolution plan by a resolution applicant, it is obviously not maintainable – However, if the submission of the plan is maintainable at the time at which it is filed, and thereafter, by the operation of the law, a person becomes ineligible, which continues either till the time of approval by the CoC, or adjudication by the authority, then the subsequent amended provision would govern the question of eligibility of resolution applicant to submit a resolution plan – If there is ineligibility which in turn prohibits the other stakeholders to proceed further and the amendment being in the nature of providing a better process, and that too in the interest of the creditors and the debtor, the same is required to be followed as against the provision that stood at an earlier point of time – Thus, a mere filing of the submission of a resolution plan has got no rationale, as it does not create any right in favour of a facilitator nor it can be extinguished – It cannot be said that what is good today cannot be applied merely because an applicant was eligible to submit a resolution plan at an earlier point of time– It is only a part of procedural law. Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 – s.12(3) – Held: There is a marked difference between extension and exclusion – Exclusion would come into play when the decision is challenged before a higher forum – Extension is one which is to be exercised by the authority constituted.",

        "HeadNote": "Karnataka Electricity Reforms Act, 1999 – s.18, Explanation to s.19, s.25(3) r/w s.17(1) and proviso to s.27(2) – Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) – The Act came into force with effect from 01.06.1999 – Under s.27 of the Act, unless there was a ‘concluded contract’ as on 01.06.1999, the Karnataka Electricity Regulatory Commission was to regulate the tariff – Whether before the Act came into force, there was a concluded contract between the parties, and therefore such a contract could not be unsettled by the regulatory regime under the Act – Held: The parties contemplated a written Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) containing various details apart from the tariff rate and the tenure – The parties were not ad idem as regards the issues which were expressly left open for negotiations – The State Government (GoK) also contemplated ‘finalising’ a PPA – The word ‘finalising’ and the word ‘PPA’, both of which did not take place before 01.06.1999 resulted in a situation where a contract could not be said to be concluded even within the meaning of the proviso to s.27(2) of the Act – This is not even a case where parties were ad idem on all the essential aspects, which go into the formation of a complex contract as involved in the facts of this case – On facts, there was no concluded contract and what is more, a PPA was not a mere desire but an indispensable requirement to conclude the terms – It is clear as day light that all through the parties undoubtedly contemplated entering into a power purchase agreement – From the subject matter of the contract, the position of the parties, the implications of the working of the contract and more importantly, the intention of the parties, it was clear that there was a concluded contract upon negotiations and correspondence, culminating in the Government Order 12.05.1999 – Even the GO dated 12.05.1999 expressly contemplated only a permission by the GoK to the KEB to finalise “a PPA” for the purchase of surplus power – The word “finalise” in the context of the PPA cannot be played down in the context of the previous correspondence at any rate – It was, in fact, also contemplated that the PPA which was to be finalised must after finalisation be submitted again to the government – GoK was thereafter to grant its approval – This cannot be overlooked. Contract Act, 1872 – s.10 – It is not essential to form a contract, that it should be in writing – Where a law stipulates that a contract be in writing in which case a contract must be reduced to writing. Contract Act, 1872 – ss.2 and 10 – Concluded contract – Held: In order that there must be a contract concluded, there must be a proposal made, which must be accepted – There must be consideration for the promise – The proposal must be accepted, which must be communicated – The acceptance must be unqualified – The parties can be said to have entered into a contract or a contract would be said to be concluded only when they are ad idem on all the essential terms of the contract – If the proposals containing the essential terms have been accepted, and the acceptance is communicated and, if the other conditions in s.2 are complied with, viz., that is there is consideration and the contract is enforceable in law, within the meaning of s.10, it would lead to the creation of a concluded contract. Karnataka Electricity Reforms Act, 1999 – proviso to s.27(2) – Concluded contract within meaning of the proviso to s.27(2) – Held: The proviso to s.27(2) when it uses the words ‘contracts concluded’, does not use the words ‘contracts concluded as regards tariffs’ – There are various other aspects about which the parties must be ad idem – The rate, the term and quantum are integrally interconnected with other terms – There cannot be concluded contract without parties being ad idem about those terms. Karnataka Electricity Reforms Act, 1999 – s.41 – Appeals against order of the Karnataka Electricity Regulatory Commission – Any person aggrieved by any decision or order of the Commission can file appeal to the High Court, on questions of law arising out of such order – Held: A Right of Appeal is a creature of a Statute – .The right can be qualified or conditioned – The ambit of the appellate power is to be discerned from the terms of the Statute – A ‘question of law’ is not the same as a ‘substantial question of law’ – However, when the Statute insists on a ‘question of law’ to maintain an appeal, the Appellate Body stands constrained to that extent – Appeal. Electricity Laws – Karnataka Electricity Regulatory Commission – The Commission is an Expert Body – Interference with its findings cannot be sustained, to begin with, if it is bereft of reasons – Findings of such a body must receive due deference – Perversity in the sense of findings, which are wholly without basis or material or which no person with the professed skills would arrive at, may merit interference – A finding, which ill squares with a clear statutory injunction, would leave the door ajar for overturning the finding.",

        "content": "Karnataka Electricity Reforms Act, 1999 – s.18, Explanation to s.19, s.25(3) r/w s.17(1) and proviso to s.27(2) – Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) – The Act came into force with effect from 01.06.1999 – Under s.27 of the Act, unless there was a ‘concluded contract’ as on 01.06.1999, the Karnataka Electricity Regulatory Commission was to regulate the tariff – Whether before the Act came into force, there was a concluded contract between the parties, and therefore such a contract could not be unsettled by the regulatory regime under the Act – Held: The parties contemplated a written Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) containing various details apart from the tariff rate and the tenure – The parties were not ad idem as regards the issues which were expressly left open for negotiations – The State Government (GoK) also contemplated ‘finalising’ a PPA – The word ‘finalising’ and the word ‘PPA’, both of which did not take place before 01.06.1999 resulted in a situation where a contract could not be said to be concluded even within the meaning of the proviso to s.27(2) of the Act – This is not even a case where parties were ad idem on all the essential aspects, which go into the formation of a complex contract as involved in the facts of this case – On facts, there was no concluded contract and what is more, a PPA was not a mere desire but an indispensable requirement to conclude the terms – It is clear as day light that all through the parties undoubtedly contemplated entering into a power purchase agreement – From the subject matter of the contract, the position of the parties, the implications of the working of the contract and more importantly, the intention of the parties, it was clear that there was a concluded contract upon negotiations and correspondence, culminating in the Government Order 12.05.1999 – Even the GO dated 12.05.1999 expressly contemplated only a permission by the GoK to the KEB to finalise “a PPA” for the purchase of surplus power – The word “finalise” in the context of the PPA cannot be played down in the context of the previous correspondence at any rate – It was, in fact, also contemplated that the PPA which was to be finalised must after finalisation be submitted again to the government – GoK was thereafter to grant its approval – This cannot be overlooked. Contract Act, 1872 – s.10 – It is not essential to form a contract, that it should be in writing – Where a law stipulates that a contract be in writing in which case a contract must be reduced to writing."

        "HeadNote": "Karnataka Electricity Reforms Act, 1999 – s.18, Explanation to s.19, s.25(3) r/w s.17(1) and proviso to s.27(2) – Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) – The Act came into force with effect from 01.06.1999 – Under s.27 of the Act, unless there was a ‘concluded contract’ as on 01.06.1999, the Karnataka Electricity Regulatory Commission was to regulate the tariff – Whether before the Act came into force, there was a concluded contract between the parties, and therefore such a contract could not be unsettled by the regulatory regime under the Act – Held: The parties contemplated a written Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) containing various details apart from the tariff rate and the tenure – The parties were not ad idem as regards the issues which were expressly left open for negotiations – The State Government (GoK) also contemplated ‘finalising’ a PPA – The word ‘finalising’ and the word ‘PPA’, both of which did not take place before 01.06.1999 resulted in a situation where a contract could not be said to be concluded even within the meaning of the proviso to s.27(2) of the Act – This is not even a case where parties were ad idem on all the essential aspects, which go into the formation of a complex contract as involved in the facts of this case – On facts, there was no concluded contract and what is more, a PPA was not a mere desire but an indispensable requirement to conclude the terms – It is clear as day light that all through the parties undoubtedly contemplated entering into a power purchase agreement – From the subject matter of the contract, the position of the parties, the implications of the working of the contract and more importantly, the intention of the parties, it was clear that there was a concluded contract upon negotiations and correspondence, culminating in the Government Order 12.05.1999 – Even the GO dated 12.05.1999 expressly contemplated only a permission by the GoK to the KEB to finalise “a PPA” for the purchase of surplus power – The word “finalise” in the context of the PPA cannot be played down in the context of the previous correspondence at any rate – It was, in fact, also contemplated that the PPA which was to be finalised must after finalisation be submitted again to the government – GoK was thereafter to grant its approval – This cannot be overlooked. Contract Act, 1872 – s.10 – It is not essential to form a contract, that it should be in writing – Where a law stipulates that a contract be in writing in which case a contract must be reduced to writing. Contract Act, 1872 – ss.2 and 10 – Concluded contract – Held: In order that there must be a contract concluded, there must be a proposal made, which must be accepted – There must be consideration for the promise – The proposal must be accepted, which must be communicated – The acceptance must be unqualified – The parties can be said to have entered into a contract or a contract would be said to be concluded only when they are ad idem on all the essential terms of the contract – If the proposals containing the essential terms have been accepted, and the acceptance is communicated and, if the other conditions in s.2 are complied with, viz., that is there is consideration and the contract is enforceable in law, within the meaning of s.10, it would lead to the creation of a concluded contract. Karnataka Electricity Reforms Act, 1999 – proviso to s.27(2) – Concluded contract within meaning of the proviso to s.27(2) – Held: The proviso to s.27(2) when it uses the words ‘contracts concluded’, does not use the words ‘contracts concluded as regards tariffs’ – There are various other aspects about which the parties must be ad idem – The rate, the term and quantum are integrally interconnected with other terms – There cannot be concluded contract without parties being ad idem about those terms. Karnataka Electricity Reforms Act, 1999 – s.41 – Appeals against order of the Karnataka Electricity Regulatory Commission – Any person aggrieved by any decision or order of the Commission can file appeal to the High Court, on questions of law arising out of such order – Held: A Right of Appeal is a creature of a Statute – .The right can be qualified or conditioned – The ambit of the appellate power is to be discerned from the terms of the Statute – A ‘question of law’ is not the same as a ‘substantial question of law’ – However, when the Statute insists on a ‘question of law’ to maintain an appeal, the Appellate Body stands constrained to that extent – Appeal. Electricity Laws – Karnataka Electricity Regulatory Commission – The Commission is an Expert Body – Interference with its findings cannot be sustained, to begin with, if it is bereft of reasons – Findings of such a body must receive due deference – Perversity in the sense of findings, which are wholly without basis or material or which no person with the professed skills would arrive at, may merit interference – A finding, which ill squares with a clear statutory injunction, would leave the door ajar for overturning the finding.",

Benami Property Transactions Act, 1988 – ss.2(a), 3 – Mens rea, absence of – Effect of – Held: The criminal provision envisaged u/ss. 2(a) and 3 does not expressly contemplate mens rea – Mens rea is an essential ingredient of a criminal offence – Absence of mens rea creates a harsh provision having strict liability –Mere fact that the object of the statute is to promote welfare activities or to eradicate a grave social evil which by itself is not decisive of the question as to whether the element of a guilty mind is excluded from the ingredients of an offence – Mens rea by necessary implication may be excluded from a statute only where it is absolutely clear that implementation of the object of the statute would otherwise be defeated – The language of s.2(a) coupled with s.3, completely ignores the aspect of mens rea, as it intends to criminalize the very act of one person paying consideration for acquisition of property for another person – The 1988 law was envisaged on the touchstone of strict liability. Judicial Review– Law with respect to testing the unconstitutionality of a statutory instrument – Held: Constitutional Courts can test constitutionality of legislative instruments (statute and delegated legislations)both on procedure as well as substantive nature of these instruments – The test should be based on a combined reading of Articles 14, 19 and 21 of the Constitution – Constitution of India – Articles 14, 19, 21. Doctrines/Principles – Doctrine of manifest arbitrariness– Discussed. Interpretation of Statutes – Law declared unconstitutional – Effect of – Held: Such a declaration would render the law not to exist in the law books since its inception – It is only a limited exception under Constitutional law, or when substantial actions have been undertaken under such unconstitutional laws that going back to the original position would be next to impossible – In those cases alone, would this Court take recourse to the concept of ‘prospective overruling’. Constitution of India –Retroactive/retrospective legislations – Legislature’s power to enact – Held: Legislature has power to enact retroactive/retrospective civil legislations under the Constitution – However, Article 20(1) mandates that no law mandating a punitive provision can be enacted retrospectively – A punitive provision cannot be couched as a civil provision to by-pass the mandate under Article 20(1) of the Constitution which follows the settled legal principle that “what cannot be done directly, cannot be done indirectly”. Words and Phrases– “Forfeiture”, “Benami”, “Benami transaction”, “Benamidar/ostensible owner”– Discussed.",

        "HeadNote": "Prohibition of Benami Property Transactions Act, 1988 – ss.3(2),5 – Benami Transactions (Prohibition) Amendment Act, 2016 – Held: s.3(2) of the unamended 1988 Act is unconstitutional for being manifestly arbitrary – Accordingly, s.3(2) of the 2016 Act is also unconstitutional as it is violative of Article 20(1) of the Constitution – Further, in rem forfeiture provision u/s.5 of the unamended Act of 1988, prior to the 2016 Amendment Act, was unconstitutional for being manifestly arbitrary – 2016 Amendment Act was not merely procedural, rather, prescribed substantive provisions – In rem forfeiture provision u/s.5 of the 2016 Act, being punitive in nature, can only be applied prospectively and not retroactively – Thus, concerned authorities cannot initiate or continue criminal prosecution or confiscation proceedings for transactions entered into prior to the coming into force of the 2016 Act, viz., 1.11.2016 –Consequently, all such prosecutions or confiscation proceedings stand quashed– Constitution of India – Article 20(1). Benami Property Transactions Act, 1988 – ss.2(a), 3 – Mens rea, absence of – Effect of – Held: The criminal provision envisaged u/ss. 2(a) and 3 does not expressly contemplate mens rea – Mens rea is an essential ingredient of a criminal offence – Absence of mens rea creates a harsh provision having strict liability –Mere fact that the object of the statute is to promote welfare activities or to eradicate a grave social evil which by itself is not decisive of the question as to whether the element of a guilty mind is excluded from the ingredients of an offence – Mens rea by necessary implication may be excluded from a statute only where it is absolutely clear that implementation of the object of the statute would otherwise be defeated – The language of s.2(a) coupled with s.3, completely ignores the aspect of mens rea, as it intends to criminalize the very act of one person paying consideration for acquisition of property for another person – The 1988 law was envisaged on the touchstone of strict liability. Judicial Review– Law with respect to testing the unconstitutionality of a statutory instrument – Held: Constitutional Courts can test constitutionality of legislative instruments (statute and delegated legislations)both on procedure as well as substantive nature of these instruments – The test should be based on a combined reading of Articles 14, 19 and 21 of the Constitution – Constitution of India – Articles 14, 19, 21. Doctrines/Principles – Doctrine of manifest arbitrariness– Discussed. Interpretation of Statutes – Law declared unconstitutional – Effect of – Held: Such a declaration would render the law not to exist in the law books since its inception – It is only a limited exception under Constitutional law, or when substantial actions have been undertaken under such unconstitutional laws that going back to the original position would be next to impossible – In those cases alone, would this Court take recourse to the concept of ‘prospective overruling’. Constitution of India –Retroactive/retrospective legislations – Legislature’s power to enact – Held: Legislature has power to enact retroactive/retrospective civil legislations under the Constitution – However, Article 20(1) mandates that no law mandating a punitive provision can be enacted retrospectively – A punitive provision cannot be couched as a civil provision to by-pass the mandate under Article 20(1) of the Constitution which follows the settled legal principle that “what cannot be done directly, cannot be done indirectly”. Words and Phrases– “Forfeiture”, “Benami”, “Benami transaction”, “Benamidar/ostensible owner”– Discussed.",

        "HeadNote": "Prohibition of Benami Property Transactions Act, 1988 – ss.3(2),5 – Benami Transactions (Prohibition) Amendment Act, 2016 – Held: s.3(2) of the unamended 1988 Act is unconstitutional for being manifestly arbitrary – Accordingly, s.3(2) of the 2016 Act is also unconstitutional as it is violative of Article 20(1) of the Constitution – Further, in rem forfeiture provision u/s.5 of the unamended Act of 1988, prior to the 2016 Amendment Act, was unconstitutional for being manifestly arbitrary – 2016 Amendment Act was not merely procedural, rather, prescribed substantive provisions – In rem forfeiture provision u/s.5 of the 2016 Act, being punitive in nature, can only be applied prospectively and not retroactively – Thus, concerned authorities cannot initiate or continue criminal prosecution or confiscation proceedings for transactions entered into prior to the coming into force of the 2016 Act, viz., 1.11.2016 –Consequently, all such prosecutions or confiscation proceedings stand quashed– Constitution of India – Article 20(1). Benami Property Transactions Act, 1988 – ss.2(a), 3 – Mens rea, absence of – Effect of – Held: The criminal provision envisaged u/ss. 2(a) and 3 does not expressly contemplate mens rea – Mens rea is an essential ingredient of a criminal offence – Absence of mens rea creates a harsh provision having strict liability –Mere fact that the object of the statute is to promote welfare activities or to eradicate a grave social evil which by itself is not decisive of the question as to whether the element of a guilty mind is excluded from the ingredients of an offence – Mens rea by necessary implication may be excluded from a statute only where it is absolutely clear that implementation of the object of the statute would otherwise be defeated – The language of s.2(a) coupled with s.3, completely ignores the aspect of mens rea, as it intends to criminalize the very act of one person paying consideration for acquisition of property for another person – The 1988 law was envisaged on the touchstone of strict liability. Judicial Review– Law with respect to testing the unconstitutionality of a statutory instrument – Held: Constitutional Courts can test constitutionality of legislative instruments (statute and delegated legislations)both on procedure as well as substantive nature of these instruments – The test should be based on a combined reading of Articles 14, 19 and 21 of the Constitution – Constitution of India – Articles 14, 19, 21. Doctrines/Principles – Doctrine of manifest arbitrariness– Discussed. Interpretation of Statutes – Law declared unconstitutional – Effect of – Held: Such a declaration would render the law not to exist in the law books since its inception – It is only a limited exception under Constitutional law, or when substantial actions have been undertaken under such unconstitutional laws that going back to the original position would be next to impossible – In those cases alone, would this Court take recourse to the concept of ‘prospective overruling’. Constitution of India –Retroactive/retrospective legislations – Legislature’s power to enact – Held: Legislature has power to enact retroactive/retrospective civil legislations under the Constitution – However, Article 20(1) mandates that no law mandating a punitive provision can be enacted retrospectively – A punitive provision cannot be couched as a civil provision to by-pass the mandate under Article 20(1) of the Constitution which follows the settled legal principle that “what cannot be done directly, cannot be done indirectly”. Words and Phrases– “Forfeiture”, “Benami”, “Benami transaction”, “Benamidar/ostensible owner”– Discussed.",

        "HeadNote": "Prohibition of Benami Property Transactions Act, 1988 – ss.3(2),5 – Benami Transactions (Prohibition) Amendment Act, 2016 – Held: s.3(2) of the unamended 1988 Act is unconstitutional for being manifestly arbitrary – Accordingly, s.3(2) of the 2016 Act is also unconstitutional as it is violative of Article 20(1) of the Constitution – Further, in rem forfeiture provision u/s.5 of the unamended Act of 1988, prior to the 2016 Amendment Act, was unconstitutional for being manifestly arbitrary – 2016 Amendment Act was not merely procedural, rather, prescribed substantive provisions – In rem forfeiture provision u/s.5 of the 2016 Act, being punitive in nature, can only be applied prospectively and not retroactively – Thus, concerned authorities cannot initiate or continue criminal prosecution or confiscation proceedings for transactions entered into prior to the coming into force of the 2016 Act, viz., 1.11.2016 –Consequently, all such prosecutions or confiscation proceedings stand quashed– Constitution of India – Article 20(1). Benami Property Transactions Act, 1988 – ss.2(a), 3 – Mens rea, absence of – Effect of – Held: The criminal provision envisaged u/ss. 2(a) and 3 does not expressly contemplate mens rea – Mens rea is an essential ingredient of a criminal offence – Absence of mens rea creates a harsh provision having strict liability –Mere fact that the object of the statute is to promote welfare activities or to eradicate a grave social evil which by itself is not decisive of the question as to whether the element of a guilty mind is excluded from the ingredients of an offence – Mens rea by necessary implication may be excluded from a statute only where it is absolutely clear that implementation of the object of the statute would otherwise be defeated – The language of s.2(a) coupled with s.3, completely ignores the aspect of mens rea, as it intends to criminalize the very act of one person paying consideration for acquisition of property for another person – The 1988 law was envisaged on the touchstone of strict liability. Judicial Review– Law with respect to testing the unconstitutionality of a statutory instrument – Held: Constitutional Courts can test constitutionality of legislative instruments (statute and delegated legislations)both on procedure as well as substantive nature of these instruments – The test should be based on a combined reading of Articles 14, 19 and 21 of the Constitution – Constitution of India – Articles 14, 19, 21. Doctrines/Principles – Doctrine of manifest arbitrariness– Discussed. Interpretation of Statutes – Law declared unconstitutional – Effect of – Held: Such a declaration would render the law not to exist in the law books since its inception – It is only a limited exception under Constitutional law, or when substantial actions have been undertaken under such unconstitutional laws that going back to the original position would be next to impossible – In those cases alone, would this Court take recourse to the concept of ‘prospective overruling’. Constitution of India –Retroactive/retrospective legislations – Legislature’s power to enact – Held: Legislature has power to enact retroactive/retrospective civil legislations under the Constitution – However, Article 20(1) mandates that no law mandating a punitive provision can be enacted retrospectively – A punitive provision cannot be couched as a civil provision to by-pass the mandate under Article 20(1) of the Constitution which follows the settled legal principle that “what cannot be done directly, cannot be done indirectly”. Words and Phrases– “Forfeiture”, “Benami”, “Benami transaction”, “Benamidar/ostensible owner”– Discussed.",

Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 – Swiss Challenge Process – Held: An Anchor Bidder has no vested right beyond the Right of First Refusal (ROFR), being the origination of the proposal – The Swiss Challenge Process is just another method of private participation recognized for its transparency – Ultimately, the IBC has left it to the discretion of the Liquidator to explore the best possible method for selling the assets of the Corporate Debtor in liquidation, which includes Private Sale through direct negotiations with the object of maximizing the value of the assets offered for sale. Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 – Jurisdiction of the NCLT and the NCLAT – Held: Powers vested in and the duties cast upon the Liquidator have been made subject to the directions of the Adjudication Authority (NCLT) u/s.35 – Once the Liquidator applies to the Adjudicating Authority (NCLT) for appropriate orders/ directions, including the decision to sell the movable and immovable assets of the Corporate Debtor in liquidation by adopting a particular mode of sale and the Adjudicating Authority (NCLT) grants approval to such a decision, there is no provision in the IBC that empowers the Appellate Authority (NCLAT) to suo motu conduct a judicial review of the said decision – The jurisdiction bestowed upon the Adjudicating Authority [NCLT] and the Appellate Authority [NCLAT] are circumscribed by the provisions of the IBC, they cannot act as a Court of equity or exercise plenary powers to unilaterally reverse the decision of the Liquidator based on commercial wisdom and supported by the stakeholders. Constitution of India – Judicial Review – Scope of – Commercial Matters – Held: It is a well-settled principle that in matters relating to commercial transactions, tenders, etc., the scope of judicial review is fairly limited and the court ought to refrain from substituting its decisions for that of the tendering agency.",

Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 – Jurisdiction of the NCLT and the NCLAT – Held: Powers vested in and the duties cast upon the Liquidator have been made subject to the directions of the Adjudication Authority (NCLT) u/s.35 – Once the Liquidator applies to the Adjudicating Authority (NCLT) for appropriate orders/ directions, including the decision to sell the movable and immovable assets of the Corporate Debtor in liquidation by adopting a particular mode of sale and the Adjudicating Authority (NCLT) grants approval to such a decision, there is no provision in the IBC that empowers the Appellate Authority (NCLAT) to suo motu conduct a judicial review of the said decision – The jurisdiction bestowed upon the Adjudicating Authority [NCLT] and the Appellate Authority [NCLAT] are circumscribed by the provisions of the IBC, they cannot act as a Court of equity or exercise plenary powers to unilaterally reverse the decision of the Liquidator based on commercial wisdom and supported by the stakeholders. Constitution of India – Judicial Review – Scope of – Commercial Matters – Held: It is a well-settled principle that in matters relating to commercial transactions, tenders, etc., the scope of judicial review is fairly limited and the court ought to refrain from substituting its decisions for that of the tendering agency.",

Criminal Law – Motive – Sufficiency or insufficiency of motive does not have a direct bearing on the actual evidence against the accused, particularly when the prosecution relies on direct evidence of injured eyewitnesses. Criminal Law – Investigation – Defective investigation by investigating authorities by itself does vitiate the case of the prosecution when there are credible eye-witness testimonies as well as other compelling pieces of evidence. Evidence – Witness – Testimony of injured eye-witness – Appreciation – Held: When there are credible ocular witnesses whose statements are corroborated by other contemporaneous evidence, certain minor variations, such as non-recovery of blood-stained clothes, certain other weapons etc. will not be fatal to the case of the prosecution.

Constitution of India: Legislative competence – Whether the Haryana Sikh Gurdwara (Management) Act, 2014 falls within the legislative competence of the Haryana State Legislature or it falls in Entry 44 of List I of the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution – Held: There is no provision in the Punjab Reorganization Act, 1966 which confers legislative power upon the Parliament in respect of the subjects over which the State has legislative competence in terms of List II – Therefore, the transitional provisions i.e., the 1966 Act or the Inter-State Corporation Act 1957 do not impinge upon the legislative competence of the State legislature to enact a law on the subjects mentioned in the List II – Entry 32 deals with unincorporated trading, literary, scientific, religious and other societies and associations – In respect of such matters, the competent legislature is the State – In terms of Entry 44 of List I, the Parliament will have jurisdiction only if the Shiromani Gurdwara Prabandhak Committee (SGPC) under the Sikh Gurdwaras Act, 1925 continues to be an inter-State entity – The jurisdiction of the successor States either to repeal, modify or enact a new law has not been restricted by the 1966 Act – The SGPC became inter-State body corporate not because of Entry 44 List I but because of reorganisation of the territories of the erstwhile State of Punjab – Therefore, Entry 44 would have no applicability in respect of legislative competence of the State of Haryana to enact the 2014 Act – Sikh Gurdwaras Act, 1925 – Religious institutions – Gurdwara. Constitution of India: Art. 254(2) – Presidential assent – Whether required for Haryana Sikh Gurdwara (Management) Act, 2014 – Held: For entries in concurrent list, assent of the President would be necessary if there is an existing statute and the State law is contrary to some of the provisions of the Central law – Though the Haryana Committee constituted under the 2014 Act is in respect of religious purposes, but the prime intention is of an incorporation of juristic entity to manage the affairs of the Sikhs in the State – Incorporation of such juristic entity more appropriately falls within the domain of Entry 32 of List II and not within Entry 28 of List III of Seventh Schedule – Assent of the President is not required for the validity of 2014 Act.

        "HeadNote": "Constitution of India, 1950 – Art.173(b) – Breach of – Qualification for membership of the State Legislature – Age criteria for contesting State Legislative Assembly elections – Discrepancy in date of birth – Burden of proof – Public documents – Probative value – Two different Birth Certificates of appellant showing date of birth at two different places and on two different dates, namely, one on 01.01.1993 at Rampur and another on 30.09.1990 at Lucknow – Elections took place for Uttar Pradesh State Legislative Assembly during January-March 2017 – Appellant was declared elected from the Suar constituency, District Rampur – Respondentelection petitioner challenged the election of the appellant on ground that he was born on 01.01.1993 and therefore was less than 25 years of age when he filed his nomination papers, and was not qualified to contest the election for State Assembly – In rebuttal, appellant claimed his date of birth to be 30.09.1990 – High Court declared the election of appellant to be void and set aside his election – Held (per Ajay Rastogi, J.): When any fact is especially within the knowledge of a party, the burden of proving it lies upon that party – The term “especially” means facts which are pre-eminently or exceptionally within the knowledge of a person – This rule cannot apply when the fact is such as to be capable of being known also by persons other than the party – In the instant case, respondent established from the documentary evidence which belongs to the appellant that, from day one appellant has shown his date of birth as 1st January, 1993 not just in his academic record but also in the birth certificate obtained from Nagar Palika, Rampur in the year 2012 – This could have been possible only when the relevant documentary evidence was available with the competent authority in the office of Nagar Palika, Rampur – Since the documents were issued from the office of the public officers based on the relevant data made available by the appellant himself, there was sufficient probative value, as required u/s.35 of the Evidence Act – Merely because the same was later on cancelled by the appellant, it may not lose its evidentiary value – Date of birth of appellant throughout in his records is 1st January, 1993 and only in the year 2015 when he became keen to enter into active politics, DW-5- his mother, submitted an application before Nagar Nigam, Lucknow for the first time on 17th January, 2015, claiming that appellant was born on 30th September 1990 – Procedure prescribed u/s.13(3) of the Act, 1969 was not followed by competent authority at Nagar Nigam, Lucknow while issuing fresh certificate of date of birth on 21st January, 2015 – No probative value could have been attached to documentary evidence obtained from the Queen Mary’s Hospital, Lucknow, as a foundation on which the birth certificate was issued on 21st January 2015 by Nagar Nigam, Lucknow – Impugned judgment of High Court accordingly upheld – Held (per B.V. Nagarathna, J.) (Concurring) : As per s. 101, the burden of proving a fact always lies upon the party who substantially asserts the affirmative and until such burden is discharged, the other party is not required to be called upon to prove his case – Burden to prove documents lie on plaintiff alone as onus is always on the person asserting a proposition or a fact – Once the plaintiff discharges the initial burden of prove and makes out a case which entitles him to relief, in terms of s. 102, the onus shifts to the defendants to prove those circumstances which would disentitle the plaintiff of the relief – However once the evidence has been led by the contesting parties, abstract considerations of onus are out of place and truth or otherwise must always be adjudged on the basis of evidence led by the parties – s. 106 is an exception to the general rule and it stipulates that when a fact to be proved is peculiarly within the knowledge of a party, it is for him to prove it – In an election petition, the initial burden to prove determination of age of returned candidate lies on the petitioner, however, burden lies on the respondent to prove facts within his special knowledge – In the present case, despite the voluminous oral and documentary evidence, the appellant has been unable to prove the fact that he was born on 30.09.1990 – Consequently, he was not 25 years old at the time of filing the nomination – Election of the appellant to state legislative assembly set aside – Evidence Act, 1972 – ss. 101 to 106, 35 and 21 – Registration of Birth and Death Act, 1969 – s.13(3) – U.P. Registration of the Birth and Death Rules, 2002 – r.9 – Representation of People’s Act, 1951 – ss. 15 and 116 A. Evidence Act, 1972 – Passports and Visas – Evidentiary value of admitted documents – Whether the information entered in the passport application would amount to proof as to contents of such application, including the date and place of birth entered therein – Held (per B.V. Nagarathna, J.): Great evidentiary value has to be attached to an application submitted to a government establishment or Office, such as a Passport Office and the details entered in such application, together with the documents submitted therewith, must be understood to be tendered by the applicant who signs the application form thereby accepting that the information submitted therein is true and correct and to the best of his knowledge – In the present case, appellant having admitted the fact that his date of birth was 01.01.1993 and place of birth was Rampur, in the application form dated 06.07.2012, it was not open for appellant to subsequently resile from the aforesaid clear admission and contend that he was unaware that an ‘incorrect’ date of birth was recorded in certain documents – Documentary evidence produced by respondent election petitioner has cogent and probative value – This is because the said documents are consistent with the admitted documents of appellant as well as with the admissions made by the appellant himself. Evidence – Public documents – Probative value of documents made, without following statutory procedure – Whether the Birth Certificate issued on 21.01.2015 by the Nagar Nigam, Lucknow, was a valid piece of evidence – Held (per B.V. Nagarathna, J.): Birth certificate issued by the Nagar Nigam Lucknow was without following the mandatory provisions of s.13 of the Births and Deaths Registration Act, 1969 – s. 13(3) of the 1969 Act and r. 9 of the U.P Registration of Birth and Death Rules, 2002 provides that any birth or death which had not been registered within one year of its occurrence, shall be registered only on an order made by a Magistrate of First Class or Presidency Magistrate after verifying the correctness of birth and death – In the present case, Nagar Nigam, Lucknow, had no jurisdiction to register the birth of the appellant after twenty five years from the date on which he was stated to be born by the issuance of the Birth Certificate on 21.01.2015 without an order of the Sub Divisional Magistrate as required u/s. 13(3) of the 1969 Act, r/w r. 9(3), 2002 Rules – Moreover, perusal of hospital records such as the Emergency O.T. (E.O.T) register and the Maternity Labour room Register (MLR), shows that same are mired with discrepancies, overwriting and factual inaccuracies which cannot be ignored – Therefore, no weight can be placed on birth certificate issued by the Nagar Nigam, Lucknow on 21.01.2015 which is stated to be issued on strength of an entry made in birth register maintained by hospital – Registration of Birth and Death Act, 1969 – s.13(3) – U.P. Registration of the Birth and Death Rules, 2002 – r.9. Evidence – Medical Evidence – Evidentiary value of bone ossification test for determining age – Held (per B.V. Nagarathna, J.): Ossification test cannot be solely relied upon as conclusive proof of age – The general rule for determining the age is that it can vary plus or minus two years and that the date of birth of a person is to be determined on the basis of the material on record and on appreciation of evidence adduced by parties – Report of an ossification test can, at most, be used to corroborate other relevant evidences, oral or documentary. Evidence – Documents of identity – Relevance of Aadhar Card, Voter I.D. Card and Driving License as regards proof of date of birth – Held (per B.V. Nagarathna, J.): Aadhar card is a means of identity and not a proof of date of birth – On facts, the Aadhar Card, Voter I.D. Card and Driving License did not conclusively establish that the appellant was above twenty five years of age on the date of filing his nomination papers or on the date of declaration of result of the legislative assembly election in question.

Nagarathna, J.) (Concurring) : As per s. 101, the burden of proving a fact always lies upon the party who substantially asserts the affirmative and until such burden is discharged, the other party is not required to be called upon to prove his case – Burden to prove documents lie on plaintiff alone as onus is always on the person asserting a proposition or a fact – Once the plaintiff discharges the initial burden of prove and makes out a case which entitles him to relief, in terms of s. 102, the onus shifts to the defendants to prove those circumstances which would disentitle the plaintiff of the relief – However once the evidence has been led by the contesting parties, abstract considerations of onus are out of place and truth or otherwise must always be adjudged on the basis of evidence led by the parties – s. 106 is an exception to the general rule and it stipulates that when a fact to be proved is peculiarly within the knowledge of a party, it is for him to prove it – In an election petition, the initial burden to prove determination of age of returned candidate lies on the petitioner, however, burden lies on the respondent to prove facts within his special knowledge – In the present case, despite the voluminous oral and documentary evidence, the appellant has been unable to prove the fact that he was born on 30.09.1990 – Consequently, he was not 25 years old at the time of filing the nomination – Election of the appellant to state legislative assembly set aside – Evidence Act, 1972 – ss. 101 to 106, 35 and 21 – Registration of Birth and Death Act, 1969 – s.13(3) – U.P. Registration of the Birth and Death Rules, 2002 – r.9 – Representation of People’s Act, 1951 – ss. 15 and 116 A. Evidence Act, 1972 – Passports and Visas – Evidentiary value of admitted documents – Whether the information entered in the passport application would amount to proof as to contents of such application, including the date and place of birth entered therein – Held (per B.V. Nagarathna, J.): Great evidentiary value has to be attached to an application submitted to a government establishment or Office, such as a Passport Office and the details entered in such application, together with the documents submitted therewith, must be understood to be tendered by the applicant who signs the application form thereby accepting that the information submitted therein is true and correct and to the best of his knowledge – In the present case, appellant having admitted the fact that his date of birth was 01.01.1993 and place of birth was Rampur, in the application form dated 06.07.2012, it was not open for appellant to subsequently resile from the aforesaid clear admission and contend that he was unaware that an ‘incorrect’ date of birth was recorded in certain documents – Documentary evidence produced by respondent election petitioner has cogent and probative value – This is because the said documents are consistent with the admitted documents of appellant as well as with the admissions made by the appellant himself. Evidence – Public documents – Probative value of documents made, without following statutory procedure – Whether the Birth Certificate issued on 21.01.2015 by the Nagar Nigam, Lucknow, was a valid piece of evidence – Held (per B.V. Nagarathna, J.): Birth certificate issued by the Nagar Nigam Lucknow was without following the mandatory provisions of s.13 of the Births and Deaths Registration Act, 1969 – s. 13(3) of the 1969 Act and r. 9 of the U.P Registration of Birth and Death Rules, 2002 provides that any birth or death which had not been registered within one year of its occurrence, shall be registered only on an order made by a Magistrate of First Class or Presidency Magistrate after verifying the correctness of birth and death – In the present case, Nagar Nigam, Lucknow, had no jurisdiction to register the birth of the appellant after twenty five years from the date on which he was stated to be born by the issuance of the Birth Certificate on 21.01.2015 without an order of the Sub Divisional Magistrate as required u/s. 13(3) of the 1969 Act, r/w r. 9(3), 2002 Rules – Moreover, perusal of hospital records such as the Emergency O.T. (E.O.T) register and the Maternity Labour room Register (MLR), shows that same are mired with discrepancies, overwriting and factual inaccuracies which cannot be ignored – Therefore, no weight can be placed on birth certificate issued by the Nagar Nigam, Lucknow on 21.01.2015 which is stated to be issued on strength of an entry made in birth register maintained by hospital – Registration of Birth and Death Act, 1969 – s.13(3) – U.P. Registration of the Birth and Death Rules, 2002 – r.9. Evidence – Medical Evidence – Evidentiary value of bone ossification test for determining age – Held (per B.V. Nagarathna, J.): Ossification test cannot be solely relied upon as conclusive proof of age – The general rule for determining the age is that it can vary plus or minus two years and that the date of birth of a person is to be determined on the basis of the material on record and on appreciation of evidence adduced by parties – Report of an ossification test can, at most, be used to corroborate other relevant evidences, oral or documentary. Evidence – Documents of identity – Relevance of Aadhar Card, Voter I.D. Card and Driving License as regards proof of date of birth – Held (per B.V. Nagarathna, J.): Aadhar card is a means of identity and not a proof of date of birth – On facts, the Aadhar Card, Voter I.D. Card and Driving License did not conclusively establish that the appellant was above twenty five years of age on the date of filing his nomination papers or on the date of declaration of result of the legislative assembly election in question. Words and Phrases – Difference between “burden of proof” and “onus of proof” – Explained.",

        "content": "101, the burden of proving a fact always lies upon the party who substantially asserts the affirmative and until such burden is discharged, the other party is not required to be called upon to prove his case – Burden to prove documents lie on plaintiff alone as onus is always on the person asserting a proposition or a fact – Once the plaintiff discharges the initial burden of prove and makes out a case which entitles him to relief, in terms of s. 102, the onus shifts to the defendants to prove those circumstances which would disentitle the plaintiff of the relief – However once the evidence has been led by the contesting parties, abstract considerations of onus are out of place and truth or otherwise must always be adjudged on the basis of evidence led by the parties – s. 106 is an exception to the general rule and it stipulates that when a fact to be proved is peculiarly within the knowledge of a party, it is for him to prove it – In an election petition, the initial burden to prove determination of age of returned candidate lies on the petitioner, however, burden lies on the respondent to prove facts within his special knowledge – In the present case, despite the voluminous oral and documentary evidence, the appellant has been unable to prove the fact that he was born on 30.09.1990 – Consequently, he was not 25 years old at the time of filing the nomination – Election of the appellant to state legislative assembly set aside – Evidence Act, 1972 – ss. 101 to 106, 35 and 21 – Registration of Birth and Death Act, 1969 – s.13(3) – U.P."

        "HeadNote": "Constitution of India, 1950 – Art.173(b) – Breach of – Qualification for membership of the State Legislature – Age criteria for contesting State Legislative Assembly elections – Discrepancy in date of birth – Burden of proof – Public documents – Probative value – Two different Birth Certificates of appellant showing date of birth at two different places and on two different dates, namely, one on 01.01.1993 at Rampur and another on 30.09.1990 at Lucknow – Elections took place for Uttar Pradesh State Legislative Assembly during January-March 2017 – Appellant was declared elected from the Suar constituency, District Rampur – Respondentelection petitioner challenged the election of the appellant on ground that he was born on 01.01.1993 and therefore was less than 25 years of age when he filed his nomination papers, and was not qualified to contest the election for State Assembly – In rebuttal, appellant claimed his date of birth to be 30.09.1990 – High Court declared the election of appellant to be void and set aside his election – Held (per Ajay Rastogi, J.): When any fact is especially within the knowledge of a party, the burden of proving it lies upon that party – The term “especially” means facts which are pre-eminently or exceptionally within the knowledge of a person – This rule cannot apply when the fact is such as to be capable of being known also by persons other than the party – In the instant case, respondent established from the documentary evidence which belongs to the appellant that, from day one appellant has shown his date of birth as 1st January, 1993 not just in his academic record but also in the birth certificate obtained from Nagar Palika, Rampur in the year 2012 – This could have been possible only when the relevant documentary evidence was available with the competent authority in the office of Nagar Palika, Rampur – Since the documents were issued from the office of the public officers based on the relevant data made available by the appellant himself, there was sufficient probative value, as required u/s.35 of the Evidence Act – Merely because the same was later on cancelled by the appellant, it may not lose its evidentiary value – Date of birth of appellant throughout in his records is 1st January, 1993 and only in the year 2015 when he became keen to enter into active politics, DW-5- his mother, submitted an application before Nagar Nigam, Lucknow for the first time on 17th January, 2015, claiming that appellant was born on 30th September 1990 – Procedure prescribed u/s.13(3) of the Act, 1969 was not followed by competent authority at Nagar Nigam, Lucknow while issuing fresh certificate of date of birth on 21st January, 2015 – No probative value could have been attached to documentary evidence obtained from the Queen Mary’s Hospital, Lucknow, as a foundation on which the birth certificate was issued on 21st January 2015 by Nagar Nigam, Lucknow – Impugned judgment of High Court accordingly upheld – Held (per B.V. Nagarathna, J.) (Concurring) : As per s. 101, the burden of proving a fact always lies upon the party who substantially asserts the affirmative and until such burden is discharged, the other party is not required to be called upon to prove his case – Burden to prove documents lie on plaintiff alone as onus is always on the person asserting a proposition or a fact – Once the plaintiff discharges the initial burden of prove and makes out a case which entitles him to relief, in terms of s. 102, the onus shifts to the defendants to prove those circumstances which would disentitle the plaintiff of the relief – However once the evidence has been led by the contesting parties, abstract considerations of onus are out of place and truth or otherwise must always be adjudged on the basis of evidence led by the parties – s. 106 is an exception to the general rule and it stipulates that when a fact to be proved is peculiarly within the knowledge of a party, it is for him to prove it – In an election petition, the initial burden to prove determination of age of returned candidate lies on the petitioner, however, burden lies on the respondent to prove facts within his special knowledge – In the present case, despite the voluminous oral and documentary evidence, the appellant has been unable to prove the fact that he was born on 30.09.1990 – Consequently, he was not 25 years old at the time of filing the nomination – Election of the appellant to state legislative assembly set aside – Evidence Act, 1972 – ss. 101 to 106, 35 and 21 – Registration of Birth and Death Act, 1969 – s.13(3) – U.P. Registration of the Birth and Death Rules, 2002 – r.9 – Representation of People’s Act, 1951 – ss. 15 and 116 A. Evidence Act, 1972 – Passports and Visas – Evidentiary value of admitted documents – Whether the information entered in the passport application would amount to proof as to contents of such application, including the date and place of birth entered therein – Held (per B.V. Nagarathna, J.): Great evidentiary value has to be attached to an application submitted to a government establishment or Office, such as a Passport Office and the details entered in such application, together with the documents submitted therewith, must be understood to be tendered by the applicant who signs the application form thereby accepting that the information submitted therein is true and correct and to the best of his knowledge – In the present case, appellant having admitted the fact that his date of birth was 01.01.1993 and place of birth was Rampur, in the application form dated 06.07.2012, it was not open for appellant to subsequently resile from the aforesaid clear admission and contend that he was unaware that an ‘incorrect’ date of birth was recorded in certain documents – Documentary evidence produced by respondent election petitioner has cogent and probative value – This is because the said documents are consistent with the admitted documents of appellant as well as with the admissions made by the appellant himself. Evidence – Public documents – Probative value of documents made, without following statutory procedure – Whether the Birth Certificate issued on 21.01.2015 by the Nagar Nigam, Lucknow, was a valid piece of evidence – Held (per B.V. Nagarathna, J.): Birth certificate issued by the Nagar Nigam Lucknow was without following the mandatory provisions of s.13 of the Births and Deaths Registration Act, 1969 – s. 13(3) of the 1969 Act and r. 9 of the U.P Registration of Birth and Death Rules, 2002 provides that any birth or death which had not been registered within one year of its occurrence, shall be registered only on an order made by a Magistrate of First Class or Presidency Magistrate after verifying the correctness of birth and death – In the present case, Nagar Nigam, Lucknow, had no jurisdiction to register the birth of the appellant after twenty five years from the date on which he was stated to be born by the issuance of the Birth Certificate on 21.01.2015 without an order of the Sub Divisional Magistrate as required u/s. 13(3) of the 1969 Act, r/w r. 9(3), 2002 Rules – Moreover, perusal of hospital records such as the Emergency O.T. (E.O.T) register and the Maternity Labour room Register (MLR), shows that same are mired with discrepancies, overwriting and factual inaccuracies which cannot be ignored – Therefore, no weight can be placed on birth certificate issued by the Nagar Nigam, Lucknow on 21.01.2015 which is stated to be issued on strength of an entry made in birth register maintained by hospital – Registration of Birth and Death Act, 1969 – s.13(3) – U.P. Registration of the Birth and Death Rules, 2002 – r.9. Evidence – Medical Evidence – Evidentiary value of bone ossification test for determining age – Held (per B.V. Nagarathna, J.): Ossification test cannot be solely relied upon as conclusive proof of age – The general rule for determining the age is that it can vary plus or minus two years and that the date of birth of a person is to be determined on the basis of the material on record and on appreciation of evidence adduced by parties – Report of an ossification test can, at most, be used to corroborate other relevant evidences, oral or documentary. Evidence – Documents of identity – Relevance of Aadhar Card, Voter I.D. Card and Driving License as regards proof of date of birth – Held (per B.V. Nagarathna, J.): Aadhar card is a means of identity and not a proof of date of birth – On facts, the Aadhar Card, Voter I.D. Card and Driving License did not conclusively establish that the appellant was above twenty five years of age on the date of filing his nomination papers or on the date of declaration of result of the legislative assembly election in question.

        "HeadNote": "Constitution of India, 1950 – Art.173(b) – Breach of – Qualification for membership of the State Legislature – Age criteria for contesting State Legislative Assembly elections – Discrepancy in date of birth – Burden of proof – Public documents – Probative value – Two different Birth Certificates of appellant showing date of birth at two different places and on two different dates, namely, one on 01.01.1993 at Rampur and another on 30.09.1990 at Lucknow – Elections took place for Uttar Pradesh State Legislative Assembly during January-March 2017 – Appellant was declared elected from the Suar constituency, District Rampur – Respondentelection petitioner challenged the election of the appellant on ground that he was born on 01.01.1993 and therefore was less than 25 years of age when he filed his nomination papers, and was not qualified to contest the election for State Assembly – In rebuttal, appellant claimed his date of birth to be 30.09.1990 – High Court declared the election of appellant to be void and set aside his election – Held (per Ajay Rastogi, J.): When any fact is especially within the knowledge of a party, the burden of proving it lies upon that party – The term “especially” means facts which are pre-eminently or exceptionally within the knowledge of a person – This rule cannot apply when the fact is such as to be capable of being known also by persons other than the party – In the instant case, respondent established from the documentary evidence which belongs to the appellant that, from day one appellant has shown his date of birth as 1st January, 1993 not just in his academic record but also in the birth certificate obtained from Nagar Palika, Rampur in the year 2012 – This could have been possible only when the relevant documentary evidence was available with the competent authority in the office of Nagar Palika, Rampur – Since the documents were issued from the office of the public officers based on the relevant data made available by the appellant himself, there was sufficient probative value, as required u/s.35 of the Evidence Act – Merely because the same was later on cancelled by the appellant, it may not lose its evidentiary value – Date of birth of appellant throughout in his records is 1st January, 1993 and only in the year 2015 when he became keen to enter into active politics, DW-5- his mother, submitted an application before Nagar Nigam, Lucknow for the first time on 17th January, 2015, claiming that appellant was born on 30th September 1990 – Procedure prescribed u/s.13(3) of the Act, 1969 was not followed by competent authority at Nagar Nigam, Lucknow while issuing fresh certificate of date of birth on 21st January, 2015 – No probative value could have been attached to documentary evidence obtained from the Queen Mary’s Hospital, Lucknow, as a foundation on which the birth certificate was issued on 21st January 2015 by Nagar Nigam, Lucknow – Impugned judgment of High Court accordingly upheld – Held (per B.V. Nagarathna, J.) (Concurring) : As per s. 101, the burden of proving a fact always lies upon the party who substantially asserts the affirmative and until such burden is discharged, the other party is not required to be called upon to prove his case – Burden to prove documents lie on plaintiff alone as onus is always on the person asserting a proposition or a fact – Once the plaintiff discharges the initial burden of prove and makes out a case which entitles him to relief, in terms of s. 102, the onus shifts to the defendants to prove those circumstances which would disentitle the plaintiff of the relief – However once the evidence has been led by the contesting parties, abstract considerations of onus are out of place and truth or otherwise must always be adjudged on the basis of evidence led by the parties – s. 106 is an exception to the general rule and it stipulates that when a fact to be proved is peculiarly within the knowledge of a party, it is for him to prove it – In an election petition, the initial burden to prove determination of age of returned candidate lies on the petitioner, however, burden lies on the respondent to prove facts within his special knowledge – In the present case, despite the voluminous oral and documentary evidence, the appellant has been unable to prove the fact that he was born on 30.09.1990 – Consequently, he was not 25 years old at the time of filing the nomination – Election of the appellant to state legislative assembly set aside – Evidence Act, 1972 – ss. 101 to 106, 35 and 21 – Registration of Birth and Death Act, 1969 – s.13(3) – U.P. Registration of the Birth and Death Rules, 2002 – r.9 – Representation of People’s Act, 1951 – ss. 15 and 116 A. Evidence Act, 1972 – Passports and Visas – Evidentiary value of admitted documents – Whether the information entered in the passport application would amount to proof as to contents of such application, including the date and place of birth entered therein – Held (per B.V. Nagarathna, J.): Great evidentiary value has to be attached to an application submitted to a government establishment or Office, such as a Passport Office and the details entered in such application, together with the documents submitted therewith, must be understood to be tendered by the applicant who signs the application form thereby accepting that the information submitted therein is true and correct and to the best of his knowledge – In the present case, appellant having admitted the fact that his date of birth was 01.01.1993 and place of birth was Rampur, in the application form dated 06.07.2012, it was not open for appellant to subsequently resile from the aforesaid clear admission and contend that he was unaware that an ‘incorrect’ date of birth was recorded in certain documents – Documentary evidence produced by respondent election petitioner has cogent and probative value – This is because the said documents are consistent with the admitted documents of appellant as well as with the admissions made by the appellant himself. Evidence – Public documents – Probative value of documents made, without following statutory procedure – Whether the Birth Certificate issued on 21.01.2015 by the Nagar Nigam, Lucknow, was a valid piece of evidence – Held (per B.V. Nagarathna, J.): Birth certificate issued by the Nagar Nigam Lucknow was without following the mandatory provisions of s.13 of the Births and Deaths Registration Act, 1969 – s. 13(3) of the 1969 Act and r. 9 of the U.P Registration of Birth and Death Rules, 2002 provides that any birth or death which had not been registered within one year of its occurrence, shall be registered only on an order made by a Magistrate of First Class or Presidency Magistrate after verifying the correctness of birth and death – In the present case, Nagar Nigam, Lucknow, had no jurisdiction to register the birth of the appellant after twenty five years from the date on which he was stated to be born by the issuance of the Birth Certificate on 21.01.2015 without an order of the Sub Divisional Magistrate as required u/s. 13(3) of the 1969 Act, r/w r. 9(3), 2002 Rules – Moreover, perusal of hospital records such as the Emergency O.T. (E.O.T) register and the Maternity Labour room Register (MLR), shows that same are mired with discrepancies, overwriting and factual inaccuracies which cannot be ignored – Therefore, no weight can be placed on birth certificate issued by the Nagar Nigam, Lucknow on 21.01.2015 which is stated to be issued on strength of an entry made in birth register maintained by hospital – Registration of Birth and Death Act, 1969 – s.13(3) – U.P. Registration of the Birth and Death Rules, 2002 – r.9. Evidence – Medical Evidence – Evidentiary value of bone ossification test for determining age – Held (per B.V. Nagarathna, J.): Ossification test cannot be solely relied upon as conclusive proof of age – The general rule for determining the age is that it can vary plus or minus two years and that the date of birth of a person is to be determined on the basis of the material on record and on appreciation of evidence adduced by parties – Report of an ossification test can, at most, be used to corroborate other relevant evidences, oral or documentary. Evidence – Documents of identity – Relevance of Aadhar Card, Voter I.D. Card and Driving License as regards proof of date of birth – Held (per B.V. Nagarathna, J.): Aadhar card is a means of identity and not a proof of date of birth – On facts, the Aadhar Card, Voter I.D. Card and Driving License did not conclusively establish that the appellant was above twenty five years of age on the date of filing his nomination papers or on the date of declaration of result of the legislative assembly election in question.

        "HeadNote": "Constitution of India, 1950 – Art.173(b) – Breach of – Qualification for membership of the State Legislature – Age criteria for contesting State Legislative Assembly elections – Discrepancy in date of birth – Burden of proof – Public documents – Probative value – Two different Birth Certificates of appellant showing date of birth at two different places and on two different dates, namely, one on 01.01.1993 at Rampur and another on 30.09.1990 at Lucknow – Elections took place for Uttar Pradesh State Legislative Assembly during January-March 2017 – Appellant was declared elected from the Suar constituency, District Rampur – Respondentelection petitioner challenged the election of the appellant on ground that he was born on 01.01.1993 and therefore was less than 25 years of age when he filed his nomination papers, and was not qualified to contest the election for State Assembly – In rebuttal, appellant claimed his date of birth to be 30.09.1990 – High Court declared the election of appellant to be void and set aside his election – Held (per Ajay Rastogi, J.): When any fact is especially within the knowledge of a party, the burden of proving it lies upon that party – The term “especially” means facts which are pre-eminently or exceptionally within the knowledge of a person – This rule cannot apply when the fact is such as to be capable of being known also by persons other than the party – In the instant case, respondent established from the documentary evidence which belongs to the appellant that, from day one appellant has shown his date of birth as 1st January, 1993 not just in his academic record but also in the birth certificate obtained from Nagar Palika, Rampur in the year 2012 – This could have been possible only when the relevant documentary evidence was available with the competent authority in the office of Nagar Palika, Rampur – Since the documents were issued from the office of the public officers based on the relevant data made available by the appellant himself, there was sufficient probative value, as required u/s.35 of the Evidence Act – Merely because the same was later on cancelled by the appellant, it may not lose its evidentiary value – Date of birth of appellant throughout in his records is 1st January, 1993 and only in the year 2015 when he became keen to enter into active politics, DW-5- his mother, submitted an application before Nagar Nigam, Lucknow for the first time on 17th January, 2015, claiming that appellant was born on 30th September 1990 – Procedure prescribed u/s.13(3) of the Act, 1969 was not followed by competent authority at Nagar Nigam, Lucknow while issuing fresh certificate of date of birth on 21st January, 2015 – No probative value could have been attached to documentary evidence obtained from the Queen Mary’s Hospital, Lucknow, as a foundation on which the birth certificate was issued on 21st January 2015 by Nagar Nigam, Lucknow – Impugned judgment of High Court accordingly upheld – Held (per B.V. Nagarathna, J.) (Concurring) : As per s. 101, the burden of proving a fact always lies upon the party who substantially asserts the affirmative and until such burden is discharged, the other party is not required to be called upon to prove his case – Burden to prove documents lie on plaintiff alone as onus is always on the person asserting a proposition or a fact – Once the plaintiff discharges the initial burden of prove and makes out a case which entitles him to relief, in terms of s. 102, the onus shifts to the defendants to prove those circumstances which would disentitle the plaintiff of the relief – However once the evidence has been led by the contesting parties, abstract considerations of onus are out of place and truth or otherwise must always be adjudged on the basis of evidence led by the parties – s. 106 is an exception to the general rule and it stipulates that when a fact to be proved is peculiarly within the knowledge of a party, it is for him to prove it – In an election petition, the initial burden to prove determination of age of returned candidate lies on the petitioner, however, burden lies on the respondent to prove facts within his special knowledge – In the present case, despite the voluminous oral and documentary evidence, the appellant has been unable to prove the fact that he was born on 30.09.1990 – Consequently, he was not 25 years old at the time of filing the nomination – Election of the appellant to state legislative assembly set aside – Evidence Act, 1972 – ss. 101 to 106, 35 and 21 – Registration of Birth and Death Act, 1969 – s.13(3) – U.P. Registration of the Birth and Death Rules, 2002 – r.9 – Representation of People’s Act, 1951 – ss. 15 and 116 A. Evidence Act, 1972 – Passports and Visas – Evidentiary value of admitted documents – Whether the information entered in the passport application would amount to proof as to contents of such application, including the date and place of birth entered therein – Held (per B.V. Nagarathna, J.): Great evidentiary value has to be attached to an application submitted to a government establishment or Office, such as a Passport Office and the details entered in such application, together with the documents submitted therewith, must be understood to be tendered by the applicant who signs the application form thereby accepting that the information submitted therein is true and correct and to the best of his knowledge – In the present case, appellant having admitted the fact that his date of birth was 01.01.1993 and place of birth was Rampur, in the application form dated 06.07.2012, it was not open for appellant to subsequently resile from the aforesaid clear admission and contend that he was unaware that an ‘incorrect’ date of birth was recorded in certain documents – Documentary evidence produced by respondent election petitioner has cogent and probative value – This is because the said documents are consistent with the admitted documents of appellant as well as with the admissions made by the appellant himself. Evidence – Public documents – Probative value of documents made, without following statutory procedure – Whether the Birth Certificate issued on 21.01.2015 by the Nagar Nigam, Lucknow, was a valid piece of evidence – Held (per B.V. Nagarathna, J.): Birth certificate issued by the Nagar Nigam Lucknow was without following the mandatory provisions of s.13 of the Births and Deaths Registration Act, 1969 – s. 13(3) of the 1969 Act and r. 9 of the U.P Registration of Birth and Death Rules, 2002 provides that any birth or death which had not been registered within one year of its occurrence, shall be registered only on an order made by a Magistrate of First Class or Presidency Magistrate after verifying the correctness of birth and death – In the present case, Nagar Nigam, Lucknow, had no jurisdiction to register the birth of the appellant after twenty five years from the date on which he was stated to be born by the issuance of the Birth Certificate on 21.01.2015 without an order of the Sub Divisional Magistrate as required u/s. 13(3) of the 1969 Act, r/w r. 9(3), 2002 Rules – Moreover, perusal of hospital records such as the Emergency O.T. (E.O.T) register and the Maternity Labour room Register (MLR), shows that same are mired with discrepancies, overwriting and factual inaccuracies which cannot be ignored – Therefore, no weight can be placed on birth certificate issued by the Nagar Nigam, Lucknow on 21.01.2015 which is stated to be issued on strength of an entry made in birth register maintained by hospital – Registration of Birth and Death Act, 1969 – s.13(3) – U.P. Registration of the Birth and Death Rules, 2002 – r.9. Evidence – Medical Evidence – Evidentiary value of bone ossification test for determining age – Held (per B.V. Nagarathna, J.): Ossification test cannot be solely relied upon as conclusive proof of age – The general rule for determining the age is that it can vary plus or minus two years and that the date of birth of a person is to be determined on the basis of the material on record and on appreciation of evidence adduced by parties – Report of an ossification test can, at most, be used to corroborate other relevant evidences, oral or documentary. Evidence – Documents of identity – Relevance of Aadhar Card, Voter I.D. Card and Driving License as regards proof of date of birth – Held (per B.V. Nagarathna, J.): Aadhar card is a means of identity and not a proof of date of birth – On facts, the Aadhar Card, Voter I.D. Card and Driving License did not conclusively establish that the appellant was above twenty five years of age on the date of filing his nomination papers or on the date of declaration of result of the legislative assembly election in question. Words and Phrases – Difference between “burden of proof” and “onus of proof” – Explained.",

Nagarathna, J.) (Concurring) : As per s. 101, the burden of proving a fact always lies upon the party who substantially asserts the affirmative and until such burden is discharged, the other party is not required to be called upon to prove his case – Burden to prove documents lie on plaintiff alone as onus is always on the person asserting a proposition or a fact – Once the plaintiff discharges the initial burden of prove and makes out a case which entitles him to relief, in terms of s. 102, the onus shifts to the defendants to prove those circumstances which would disentitle the plaintiff of the relief – However once the evidence has been led by the contesting parties, abstract considerations of onus are out of place and truth or otherwise must always be adjudged on the basis of evidence led by the parties – s. 106 is an exception to the general rule and it stipulates that when a fact to be proved is peculiarly within the knowledge of a party, it is for him to prove it – In an election petition, the initial burden to prove determination of age of returned candidate lies on the petitioner, however, burden lies on the respondent to prove facts within his special knowledge – In the present case, despite the voluminous oral and documentary evidence, the appellant has been unable to prove the fact that he was born on 30.09.1990 – Consequently, he was not 25 years old at the time of filing the nomination – Election of the appellant to state legislative assembly set aside – Evidence Act, 1972 – ss. 101 to 106, 35 and 21 – Registration of Birth and Death Act, 1969 – s.13(3) – U.P. Registration of the Birth and Death Rules, 2002 – r.9 – Representation of People’s Act, 1951 – ss. 15 and 116 A. Evidence Act, 1972 – Passports and Visas – Evidentiary value of admitted documents – Whether the information entered in the passport application would amount to proof as to contents of such application, including the date and place of birth entered therein – Held (per B.V. Nagarathna, J.): Great evidentiary value has to be attached to an application submitted to a government establishment or Office, such as a Passport Office and the details entered in such application, together with the documents submitted therewith, must be understood to be tendered by the applicant who signs the application form thereby accepting that the information submitted therein is true and correct and to the best of his knowledge – In the present case, appellant having admitted the fact that his date of birth was 01.01.1993 and place of birth was Rampur, in the application form dated 06.07.2012, it was not open for appellant to subsequently resile from the aforesaid clear admission and contend that he was unaware that an ‘incorrect’ date of birth was recorded in certain documents – Documentary evidence produced by respondent election petitioner has cogent and probative value – This is because the said documents are consistent with the admitted documents of appellant as well as with the admissions made by the appellant himself. Evidence – Public documents – Probative value of documents made, without following statutory procedure – Whether the Birth Certificate issued on 21.01.2015 by the Nagar Nigam, Lucknow, was a valid piece of evidence – Held (per B.V. Nagarathna, J.): Birth certificate issued by the Nagar Nigam Lucknow was without following the mandatory provisions of s.13 of the Births and Deaths Registration Act, 1969 – s. 13(3) of the 1969 Act and r. 9 of the U.P Registration of Birth and Death Rules, 2002 provides that any birth or death which had not been registered within one year of its occurrence, shall be registered only on an order made by a Magistrate of First Class or Presidency Magistrate after verifying the correctness of birth and death – In the present case, Nagar Nigam, Lucknow, had no jurisdiction to register the birth of the appellant after twenty five years from the date on which he was stated to be born by the issuance of the Birth Certificate on 21.01.2015 without an order of the Sub Divisional Magistrate as required u/s. 13(3) of the 1969 Act, r/w r. 9(3), 2002 Rules – Moreover, perusal of hospital records such as the Emergency O.T. (E.O.T) register and the Maternity Labour room Register (MLR), shows that same are mired with discrepancies, overwriting and factual inaccuracies which cannot be ignored – Therefore, no weight can be placed on birth certificate issued by the Nagar Nigam, Lucknow on 21.01.2015 which is stated to be issued on strength of an entry made in birth register maintained by hospital – Registration of Birth and Death Act, 1969 – s.13(3) – U.P. Registration of the Birth and Death Rules, 2002 – r.9. Evidence – Medical Evidence – Evidentiary value of bone ossification test for determining age – Held (per B.V. Nagarathna, J.): Ossification test cannot be solely relied upon as conclusive proof of age – The general rule for determining the age is that it can vary plus or minus two years and that the date of birth of a person is to be determined on the basis of the material on record and on appreciation of evidence adduced by parties – Report of an ossification test can, at most, be used to corroborate other relevant evidences, oral or documentary. Evidence – Documents of identity – Relevance of Aadhar Card, Voter I.D. Card and Driving License as regards proof of date of birth – Held (per B.V. Nagarathna, J.): Aadhar card is a means of identity and not a proof of date of birth – On facts, the Aadhar Card, Voter I.D. Card and Driving License did not conclusively establish that the appellant was above twenty five years of age on the date of filing his nomination papers or on the date of declaration of result of the legislative assembly election in question.

Nagarathna, J.) (Concurring) : As per s. 101, the burden of proving a fact always lies upon the party who substantially asserts the affirmative and until such burden is discharged, the other party is not required to be called upon to prove his case – Burden to prove documents lie on plaintiff alone as onus is always on the person asserting a proposition or a fact – Once the plaintiff discharges the initial burden of prove and makes out a case which entitles him to relief, in terms of s. 102, the onus shifts to the defendants to prove those circumstances which would disentitle the plaintiff of the relief – However once the evidence has been led by the contesting parties, abstract considerations of onus are out of place and truth or otherwise must always be adjudged on the basis of evidence led by the parties – s. 106 is an exception to the general rule and it stipulates that when a fact to be proved is peculiarly within the knowledge of a party, it is for him to prove it – In an election petition, the initial burden to prove determination of age of returned candidate lies on the petitioner, however, burden lies on the respondent to prove facts within his special knowledge – In the present case, despite the voluminous oral and documentary evidence, the appellant has been unable to prove the fact that he was born on 30.09.1990 – Consequently, he was not 25 years old at the time of filing the nomination – Election of the appellant to state legislative assembly set aside – Evidence Act, 1972 – ss. 101 to 106, 35 and 21 – Registration of Birth and Death Act, 1969 – s.13(3) – U.P. Registration of the Birth and Death Rules, 2002 – r.9 – Representation of People’s Act, 1951 – ss. 15 and 116 A. Evidence Act, 1972 – Passports and Visas – Evidentiary value of admitted documents – Whether the information entered in the passport application would amount to proof as to contents of such application, including the date and place of birth entered therein – Held (per B.V. Nagarathna, J.): Great evidentiary value has to be attached to an application submitted to a government establishment or Office, such as a Passport Office and the details entered in such application, together with the documents submitted therewith, must be understood to be tendered by the applicant who signs the application form thereby accepting that the information submitted therein is true and correct and to the best of his knowledge – In the present case, appellant having admitted the fact that his date of birth was 01.01.1993 and place of birth was Rampur, in the application form dated 06.07.2012, it was not open for appellant to subsequently resile from the aforesaid clear admission and contend that he was unaware that an ‘incorrect’ date of birth was recorded in certain documents – Documentary evidence produced by respondent election petitioner has cogent and probative value – This is because the said documents are consistent with the admitted documents of appellant as well as with the admissions made by the appellant himself. Evidence – Public documents – Probative value of documents made, without following statutory procedure – Whether the Birth Certificate issued on 21.01.2015 by the Nagar Nigam, Lucknow, was a valid piece of evidence – Held (per B.V. Nagarathna, J.): Birth certificate issued by the Nagar Nigam Lucknow was without following the mandatory provisions of s.13 of the Births and Deaths Registration Act, 1969 – s. 13(3) of the 1969 Act and r. 9 of the U.P Registration of Birth and Death Rules, 2002 provides that any birth or death which had not been registered within one year of its occurrence, shall be registered only on an order made by a Magistrate of First Class or Presidency Magistrate after verifying the correctness of birth and death – In the present case, Nagar Nigam, Lucknow, had no jurisdiction to register the birth of the appellant after twenty five years from the date on which he was stated to be born by the issuance of the Birth Certificate on 21.01.2015 without an order of the Sub Divisional Magistrate as required u/s. 13(3) of the 1969 Act, r/w r. 9(3), 2002 Rules – Moreover, perusal of hospital records such as the Emergency O.T. (E.O.T) register and the Maternity Labour room Register (MLR), shows that same are mired with discrepancies, overwriting and factual inaccuracies which cannot be ignored – Therefore, no weight can be placed on birth certificate issued by the Nagar Nigam, Lucknow on 21.01.2015 which is stated to be issued on strength of an entry made in birth register maintained by hospital – Registration of Birth and Death Act, 1969 – s.13(3) – U.P. Registration of the Birth and Death Rules, 2002 – r.9. Evidence – Medical Evidence – Evidentiary value of bone ossification test for determining age – Held (per B.V. Nagarathna, J.): Ossification test cannot be solely relied upon as conclusive proof of age – The general rule for determining the age is that it can vary plus or minus two years and that the date of birth of a person is to be determined on the basis of the material on record and on appreciation of evidence adduced by parties – Report of an ossification test can, at most, be used to corroborate other relevant evidences, oral or documentary. Evidence – Documents of identity – Relevance of Aadhar Card, Voter I.D. Card and Driving License as regards proof of date of birth – Held (per B.V. Nagarathna, J.): Aadhar card is a means of identity and not a proof of date of birth – On facts, the Aadhar Card, Voter I.D. Card and Driving License did not conclusively establish that the appellant was above twenty five years of age on the date of filing his nomination papers or on the date of declaration of result of the legislative assembly election in question.

Nagarathna, J.) (Concurring) : As per s. 101, the burden of proving a fact always lies upon the party who substantially asserts the affirmative and until such burden is discharged, the other party is not required to be called upon to prove his case – Burden to prove documents lie on plaintiff alone as onus is always on the person asserting a proposition or a fact – Once the plaintiff discharges the initial burden of prove and makes out a case which entitles him to relief, in terms of s. 102, the onus shifts to the defendants to prove those circumstances which would disentitle the plaintiff of the relief – However once the evidence has been led by the contesting parties, abstract considerations of onus are out of place and truth or otherwise must always be adjudged on the basis of evidence led by the parties – s. 106 is an exception to the general rule and it stipulates that when a fact to be proved is peculiarly within the knowledge of a party, it is for him to prove it – In an election petition, the initial burden to prove determination of age of returned candidate lies on the petitioner, however, burden lies on the respondent to prove facts within his special knowledge – In the present case, despite the voluminous oral and documentary evidence, the appellant has been unable to prove the fact that he was born on 30.09.1990 – Consequently, he was not 25 years old at the time of filing the nomination – Election of the appellant to state legislative assembly set aside – Evidence Act, 1972 – ss. 101 to 106, 35 and 21 – Registration of Birth and Death Act, 1969 – s.13(3) – U.P. Registration of the Birth and Death Rules, 2002 – r.9 – Representation of People’s Act, 1951 – ss. 15 and 116 A. Evidence Act, 1972 – Passports and Visas – Evidentiary value of admitted documents – Whether the information entered in the passport application would amount to proof as to contents of such application, including the date and place of birth entered therein – Held (per B.V. Nagarathna, J.): Great evidentiary value has to be attached to an application submitted to a government establishment or Office, such as a Passport Office and the details entered in such application, together with the documents submitted therewith, must be understood to be tendered by the applicant who signs the application form thereby accepting that the information submitted therein is true and correct and to the best of his knowledge – In the present case, appellant having admitted the fact that his date of birth was 01.01.1993 and place of birth was Rampur, in the application form dated 06.07.2012, it was not open for appellant to subsequently resile from the aforesaid clear admission and contend that he was unaware that an ‘incorrect’ date of birth was recorded in certain documents – Documentary evidence produced by respondent election petitioner has cogent and probative value – This is because the said documents are consistent with the admitted documents of appellant as well as with the admissions made by the appellant himself. Evidence – Public documents – Probative value of documents made, without following statutory procedure – Whether the Birth Certificate issued on 21.01.2015 by the Nagar Nigam, Lucknow, was a valid piece of evidence – Held (per B.V. Nagarathna, J.): Birth certificate issued by the Nagar Nigam Lucknow was without following the mandatory provisions of s.13 of the Births and Deaths Registration Act, 1969 – s. 13(3) of the 1969 Act and r. 9 of the U.P Registration of Birth and Death Rules, 2002 provides that any birth or death which had not been registered within one year of its occurrence, shall be registered only on an order made by a Magistrate of First Class or Presidency Magistrate after verifying the correctness of birth and death – In the present case, Nagar Nigam, Lucknow, had no jurisdiction to register the birth of the appellant after twenty five years from the date on which he was stated to be born by the issuance of the Birth Certificate on 21.01.2015 without an order of the Sub Divisional Magistrate as required u/s. 13(3) of the 1969 Act, r/w r. 9(3), 2002 Rules – Moreover, perusal of hospital records such as the Emergency O.T. (E.O.T) register and the Maternity Labour room Register (MLR), shows that same are mired with discrepancies, overwriting and factual inaccuracies which cannot be ignored – Therefore, no weight can be placed on birth certificate issued by the Nagar Nigam, Lucknow on 21.01.2015 which is stated to be issued on strength of an entry made in birth register maintained by hospital – Registration of Birth and Death Act, 1969 – s.13(3) – U.P. Registration of the Birth and Death Rules, 2002 – r.9. Evidence – Medical Evidence – Evidentiary value of bone ossification test for determining age – Held (per B.V. Nagarathna, J.): Ossification test cannot be solely relied upon as conclusive proof of age – The general rule for determining the age is that it can vary plus or minus two years and that the date of birth of a person is to be determined on the basis of the material on record and on appreciation of evidence adduced by parties – Report of an ossification test can, at most, be used to corroborate other relevant evidences, oral or documentary. Evidence – Documents of identity – Relevance of Aadhar Card, Voter I.D. Card and Driving License as regards proof of date of birth – Held (per B.V. Nagarathna, J.): Aadhar card is a means of identity and not a proof of date of birth – On facts, the Aadhar Card, Voter I.D. Card and Driving License did not conclusively establish that the appellant was above twenty five years of age on the date of filing his nomination papers or on the date of declaration of result of the legislative assembly election in question.

Nagarathna, J.) (Concurring) : As per s. 101, the burden of proving a fact always lies upon the party who substantially asserts the affirmative and until such burden is discharged, the other party is not required to be called upon to prove his case – Burden to prove documents lie on plaintiff alone as onus is always on the person asserting a proposition or a fact – Once the plaintiff discharges the initial burden of prove and makes out a case which entitles him to relief, in terms of s. 102, the onus shifts to the defendants to prove those circumstances which would disentitle the plaintiff of the relief – However once the evidence has been led by the contesting parties, abstract considerations of onus are out of place and truth or otherwise must always be adjudged on the basis of evidence led by the parties – s. 106 is an exception to the general rule and it stipulates that when a fact to be proved is peculiarly within the knowledge of a party, it is for him to prove it – In an election petition, the initial burden to prove determination of age of returned candidate lies on the petitioner, however, burden lies on the respondent to prove facts within his special knowledge – In the present case, despite the voluminous oral and documentary evidence, the appellant has been unable to prove the fact that he was born on 30.09.1990 – Consequently, he was not 25 years old at the time of filing the nomination – Election of the appellant to state legislative assembly set aside – Evidence Act, 1972 – ss. 101 to 106, 35 and 21 – Registration of Birth and Death Act, 1969 – s.13(3) – U.P. Registration of the Birth and Death Rules, 2002 – r.9 – Representation of People’s Act, 1951 – ss. 15 and 116 A. Evidence Act, 1972 – Passports and Visas – Evidentiary value of admitted documents – Whether the information entered in the passport application would amount to proof as to contents of such application, including the date and place of birth entered therein – Held (per B.V. Nagarathna, J.): Great evidentiary value has to be attached to an application submitted to a government establishment or Office, such as a Passport Office and the details entered in such application, together with the documents submitted therewith, must be understood to be tendered by the applicant who signs the application form thereby accepting that the information submitted therein is true and correct and to the best of his knowledge – In the present case, appellant having admitted the fact that his date of birth was 01.01.1993 and place of birth was Rampur, in the application form dated 06.07.2012, it was not open for appellant to subsequently resile from the aforesaid clear admission and contend that he was unaware that an ‘incorrect’ date of birth was recorded in certain documents – Documentary evidence produced by respondent election petitioner has cogent and probative value – This is because the said documents are consistent with the admitted documents of appellant as well as with the admissions made by the appellant himself. Evidence – Public documents – Probative value of documents made, without following statutory procedure – Whether the Birth Certificate issued on 21.01.2015 by the Nagar Nigam, Lucknow, was a valid piece of evidence – Held (per B.V. Nagarathna, J.): Birth certificate issued by the Nagar Nigam Lucknow was without following the mandatory provisions of s.13 of the Births and Deaths Registration Act, 1969 – s. 13(3) of the 1969 Act and r. 9 of the U.P Registration of Birth and Death Rules, 2002 provides that any birth or death which had not been registered within one year of its occurrence, shall be registered only on an order made by a Magistrate of First Class or Presidency Magistrate after verifying the correctness of birth and death – In the present case, Nagar Nigam, Lucknow, had no jurisdiction to register the birth of the appellant after twenty five years from the date on which he was stated to be born by the issuance of the Birth Certificate on 21.01.2015 without an order of the Sub Divisional Magistrate as required u/s. 13(3) of the 1969 Act, r/w r. 9(3), 2002 Rules – Moreover, perusal of hospital records such as the Emergency O.T. (E.O.T) register and the Maternity Labour room Register (MLR), shows that same are mired with discrepancies, overwriting and factual inaccuracies which cannot be ignored – Therefore, no weight can be placed on birth certificate issued by the Nagar Nigam, Lucknow on 21.01.2015 which is stated to be issued on strength of an entry made in birth register maintained by hospital – Registration of Birth and Death Act, 1969 – s.13(3) – U.P. Registration of the Birth and Death Rules, 2002 – r.9. Evidence – Medical Evidence – Evidentiary value of bone ossification test for determining age – Held (per B.V. Nagarathna, J.): Ossification test cannot be solely relied upon as conclusive proof of age – The general rule for determining the age is that it can vary plus or minus two years and that the date of birth of a person is to be determined on the basis of the material on record and on appreciation of evidence adduced by parties – Report of an ossification test can, at most, be used to corroborate other relevant evidences, oral or documentary. Evidence – Documents of identity – Relevance of Aadhar Card, Voter I.D. Card and Driving License as regards proof of date of birth – Held (per B.V. Nagarathna, J.): Aadhar card is a means of identity and not a proof of date of birth – On facts, the Aadhar Card, Voter I.D. Card and Driving License did not conclusively establish that the appellant was above twenty five years of age on the date of filing his nomination papers or on the date of declaration of result of the legislative assembly election in question. Words and Phrases – Difference between “burden of proof” and “onus of proof” – Explained.",

Nagarathna, J.) (Concurring) : As per s. 101, the burden of proving a fact always lies upon the party who substantially asserts the affirmative and until such burden is discharged, the other party is not required to be called upon to prove his case – Burden to prove documents lie on plaintiff alone as onus is always on the person asserting a proposition or a fact – Once the plaintiff discharges the initial burden of prove and makes out a case which entitles him to relief, in terms of s. 102, the onus shifts to the defendants to prove those circumstances which would disentitle the plaintiff of the relief – However once the evidence has been led by the contesting parties, abstract considerations of onus are out of place and truth or otherwise must always be adjudged on the basis of evidence led by the parties – s. 106 is an exception to the general rule and it stipulates that when a fact to be proved is peculiarly within the knowledge of a party, it is for him to prove it – In an election petition, the initial burden to prove determination of age of returned candidate lies on the petitioner, however, burden lies on the respondent to prove facts within his special knowledge – In the present case, despite the voluminous oral and documentary evidence, the appellant has been unable to prove the fact that he was born on 30.09.1990 – Consequently, he was not 25 years old at the time of filing the nomination – Election of the appellant to state legislative assembly set aside – Evidence Act, 1972 – ss. 101 to 106, 35 and 21 – Registration of Birth and Death Act, 1969 – s.13(3) – U.P. Registration of the Birth and Death Rules, 2002 – r.9 – Representation of People’s Act, 1951 – ss. 15 and 116 A. Evidence Act, 1972 – Passports and Visas – Evidentiary value of admitted documents – Whether the information entered in the passport application would amount to proof as to contents of such application, including the date and place of birth entered therein – Held (per B.V. Nagarathna, J.): Great evidentiary value has to be attached to an application submitted to a government establishment or Office, such as a Passport Office and the details entered in such application, together with the documents submitted therewith, must be understood to be tendered by the applicant who signs the application form thereby accepting that the information submitted therein is true and correct and to the best of his knowledge – In the present case, appellant having admitted the fact that his date of birth was 01.01.1993 and place of birth was Rampur, in the application form dated 06.07.2012, it was not open for appellant to subsequently resile from the aforesaid clear admission and contend that he was unaware that an ‘incorrect’ date of birth was recorded in certain documents – Documentary evidence produced by respondent election petitioner has cogent and probative value – This is because the said documents are consistent with the admitted documents of appellant as well as with the admissions made by the appellant himself. Evidence – Public documents – Probative value of documents made, without following statutory procedure – Whether the Birth Certificate issued on 21.01.2015 by the Nagar Nigam, Lucknow, was a valid piece of evidence – Held (per B.V. Nagarathna, J.): Birth certificate issued by the Nagar Nigam Lucknow was without following the mandatory provisions of s.13 of the Births and Deaths Registration Act, 1969 – s. 13(3) of the 1969 Act and r. 9 of the U.P Registration of Birth and Death Rules, 2002 provides that any birth or death which had not been registered within one year of its occurrence, shall be registered only on an order made by a Magistrate of First Class or Presidency Magistrate after verifying the correctness of birth and death – In the present case, Nagar Nigam, Lucknow, had no jurisdiction to register the birth of the appellant after twenty five years from the date on which he was stated to be born by the issuance of the Birth Certificate on 21.01.2015 without an order of the Sub Divisional Magistrate as required u/s. 13(3) of the 1969 Act, r/w r. 9(3), 2002 Rules – Moreover, perusal of hospital records such as the Emergency O.T. (E.O.T) register and the Maternity Labour room Register (MLR), shows that same are mired with discrepancies, overwriting and factual inaccuracies which cannot be ignored – Therefore, no weight can be placed on birth certificate issued by the Nagar Nigam, Lucknow on 21.01.2015 which is stated to be issued on strength of an entry made in birth register maintained by hospital – Registration of Birth and Death Act, 1969 – s.13(3) – U.P. Registration of the Birth and Death Rules, 2002 – r.9. Evidence – Medical Evidence – Evidentiary value of bone ossification test for determining age – Held (per B.V. Nagarathna, J.): Ossification test cannot be solely relied upon as conclusive proof of age – The general rule for determining the age is that it can vary plus or minus two years and that the date of birth of a person is to be determined on the basis of the material on record and on appreciation of evidence adduced by parties – Report of an ossification test can, at most, be used to corroborate other relevant evidences, oral or documentary. Evidence – Documents of identity – Relevance of Aadhar Card, Voter I.D. Card and Driving License as regards proof of date of birth – Held (per B.V. Nagarathna, J.): Aadhar card is a means of identity and not a proof of date of birth – On facts, the Aadhar Card, Voter I.D. Card and Driving License did not conclusively establish that the appellant was above twenty five years of age on the date of filing his nomination papers or on the date of declaration of result of the legislative assembly election in question.

        "HeadNote": "Constitution of India, 1950 – Art.173(b) – Breach of – Qualification for membership of the State Legislature – Age criteria for contesting State Legislative Assembly elections – Discrepancy in date of birth – Burden of proof – Public documents – Probative value – Two different Birth Certificates of appellant showing date of birth at two different places and on two different dates, namely, one on 01.01.1993 at Rampur and another on 30.09.1990 at Lucknow – Elections took place for Uttar Pradesh State Legislative Assembly during January-March 2017 – Appellant was declared elected from the Suar constituency, District Rampur – Respondentelection petitioner challenged the election of the appellant on ground that he was born on 01.01.1993 and therefore was less than 25 years of age when he filed his nomination papers, and was not qualified to contest the election for State Assembly – In rebuttal, appellant claimed his date of birth to be 30.09.1990 – High Court declared the election of appellant to be void and set aside his election – Held (per Ajay Rastogi, J.): When any fact is especially within the knowledge of a party, the burden of proving it lies upon that party – The term “especially” means facts which are pre-eminently or exceptionally within the knowledge of a person – This rule cannot apply when the fact is such as to be capable of being known also by persons other than the party – In the instant case, respondent established from the documentary evidence which belongs to the appellant that, from day one appellant has shown his date of birth as 1st January, 1993 not just in his academic record but also in the birth certificate obtained from Nagar Palika, Rampur in the year 2012 – This could have been possible only when the relevant documentary evidence was available with the competent authority in the office of Nagar Palika, Rampur – Since the documents were issued from the office of the public officers based on the relevant data made available by the appellant himself, there was sufficient probative value, as required u/s.35 of the Evidence Act – Merely because the same was later on cancelled by the appellant, it may not lose its evidentiary value – Date of birth of appellant throughout in his records is 1st January, 1993 and only in the year 2015 when he became keen to enter into active politics, DW-5- his mother, submitted an application before Nagar Nigam, Lucknow for the first time on 17th January, 2015, claiming that appellant was born on 30th September 1990 – Procedure prescribed u/s.13(3) of the Act, 1969 was not followed by competent authority at Nagar Nigam, Lucknow while issuing fresh certificate of date of birth on 21st January, 2015 – No probative value could have been attached to documentary evidence obtained from the Queen Mary’s Hospital, Lucknow, as a foundation on which the birth certificate was issued on 21st January 2015 by Nagar Nigam, Lucknow – Impugned judgment of High Court accordingly upheld – Held (per B.V. Nagarathna, J.) (Concurring) : As per s. 101, the burden of proving a fact always lies upon the party who substantially asserts the affirmative and until such burden is discharged, the other party is not required to be called upon to prove his case – Burden to prove documents lie on plaintiff alone as onus is always on the person asserting a proposition or a fact – Once the plaintiff discharges the initial burden of prove and makes out a case which entitles him to relief, in terms of s. 102, the onus shifts to the defendants to prove those circumstances which would disentitle the plaintiff of the relief – However once the evidence has been led by the contesting parties, abstract considerations of onus are out of place and truth or otherwise must always be adjudged on the basis of evidence led by the parties – s. 106 is an exception to the general rule and it stipulates that when a fact to be proved is peculiarly within the knowledge of a party, it is for him to prove it – In an election petition, the initial burden to prove determination of age of returned candidate lies on the petitioner, however, burden lies on the respondent to prove facts within his special knowledge – In the present case, despite the voluminous oral and documentary evidence, the appellant has been unable to prove the fact that he was born on 30.09.1990 – Consequently, he was not 25 years old at the time of filing the nomination – Election of the appellant to state legislative assembly set aside – Evidence Act, 1972 – ss. 101 to 106, 35 and 21 – Registration of Birth and Death Act, 1969 – s.13(3) – U.P. Registration of the Birth and Death Rules, 2002 – r.9 – Representation of People’s Act, 1951 – ss. 15 and 116 A. Evidence Act, 1972 – Passports and Visas – Evidentiary value of admitted documents – Whether the information entered in the passport application would amount to proof as to contents of such application, including the date and place of birth entered therein – Held (per B.V. Nagarathna, J.): Great evidentiary value has to be attached to an application submitted to a government establishment or Office, such as a Passport Office and the details entered in such application, together with the documents submitted therewith, must be understood to be tendered by the applicant who signs the application form thereby accepting that the information submitted therein is true and correct and to the best of his knowledge – In the present case, appellant having admitted the fact that his date of birth was 01.01.1993 and place of birth was Rampur, in the application form dated 06.07.2012, it was not open for appellant to subsequently resile from the aforesaid clear admission and contend that he was unaware that an ‘incorrect’ date of birth was recorded in certain documents – Documentary evidence produced by respondent election petitioner has cogent and probative value – This is because the said documents are consistent with the admitted documents of appellant as well as with the admissions made by the appellant himself. Evidence – Public documents – Probative value of documents made, without following statutory procedure – Whether the Birth Certificate issued on 21.01.2015 by the Nagar Nigam, Lucknow, was a valid piece of evidence – Held (per B.V. Nagarathna, J.): Birth certificate issued by the Nagar Nigam Lucknow was without following the mandatory provisions of s.13 of the Births and Deaths Registration Act, 1969 – s. 13(3) of the 1969 Act and r. 9 of the U.P Registration of Birth and Death Rules, 2002 provides that any birth or death which had not been registered within one year of its occurrence, shall be registered only on an order made by a Magistrate of First Class or Presidency Magistrate after verifying the correctness of birth and death – In the present case, Nagar Nigam, Lucknow, had no jurisdiction to register the birth of the appellant after twenty five years from the date on which he was stated to be born by the issuance of the Birth Certificate on 21.01.2015 without an order of the Sub Divisional Magistrate as required u/s. 13(3) of the 1969 Act, r/w r. 9(3), 2002 Rules – Moreover, perusal of hospital records such as the Emergency O.T. (E.O.T) register and the Maternity Labour room Register (MLR), shows that same are mired with discrepancies, overwriting and factual inaccuracies which cannot be ignored – Therefore, no weight can be placed on birth certificate issued by the Nagar Nigam, Lucknow on 21.01.2015 which is stated to be issued on strength of an entry made in birth register maintained by hospital – Registration of Birth and Death Act, 1969 – s.13(3) – U.P. Registration of the Birth and Death Rules, 2002 – r.9. Evidence – Medical Evidence – Evidentiary value of bone ossification test for determining age – Held (per B.V. Nagarathna, J.): Ossification test cannot be solely relied upon as conclusive proof of age – The general rule for determining the age is that it can vary plus or minus two years and that the date of birth of a person is to be determined on the basis of the material on record and on appreciation of evidence adduced by parties – Report of an ossification test can, at most, be used to corroborate other relevant evidences, oral or documentary. Evidence – Documents of identity – Relevance of Aadhar Card, Voter I.D. Card and Driving License as regards proof of date of birth – Held (per B.V. Nagarathna, J.): Aadhar card is a means of identity and not a proof of date of birth – On facts, the Aadhar Card, Voter I.D. Card and Driving License did not conclusively establish that the appellant was above twenty five years of age on the date of filing his nomination papers or on the date of declaration of result of the legislative assembly election in question.
