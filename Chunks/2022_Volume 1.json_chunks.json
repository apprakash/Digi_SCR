        "HeadNote": "Hindu Succession Act, 1956: Self acquired property of maleHindu dying intestate – Right of daughter of such male Hindu toinherit – Held: If a property of a male Hindu dying intestate is aself acquired property or obtained in partition of a co-parceneryor a family property, the same would devolve by inheritance andnot by survivorship, and a daughter of such a male Hindu wouldbe entitled to inherit such property in preference to other collaterals– In the case at hands, since the property in question was admittedlythe self-acquired property of male Hindu despite the family beingin state of jointness upon his death intestate, his sole survivingdaughter will inherit the same by inheritance and the property shallnot devolve by survivorship.Hindu Succession Act, 1956: Scheme of the Act – Held: Themain scheme of this Act is to establish complete equality betweenmale and female with regard to property rights and the rights of thefemale were declared absolute, completely abolishing all notions ofa limited estate – The Act brought about changes in the law ofsuccession among Hindus and gave rights which were till thenunknown in relation to women’s property – The Act lays down auniform and comprehensive system of inheritance and applies, inter-alia, to persons governed by the Mitakshara and DayabhagaSchools and also to those governed previously by theMurumakkattayam, Aliyasantana and Nambudri Laws – The Actapplies to every person, who is a Hindu by religion in any of itsforms including a Virashaiva, a Lingayat or a follower of the BrahmoPararthana or Arya Samaj and even to any person who is Buddhist,Jain or Sikh by religion excepting one who is Muslim, Christian,Parsi or Jew or Sikh by religion.Hindu Succession Act, 1956: s.14 – Absolute right of femaleHindu – Held: s.14 of the Act of 1956 declares property of a femaleHindu to be her absolute property – The legislative intent of enactings.14(I) of the Act was to remedy the limitation of a Hindu womanwho could not claim absolute interest in the properties inherited byher but only had a life interest in the estate so inherited – s.14(1)converted all limited estates owned by women into absolute estatesand the succession of these properties in the absence of a will ortestament would take place in consonance with s.15 of the Act, 1956.Hindu Succession Act, 1956: s.15(2) – Purpose of enactment– Held: The basic aim of the legislature in enacting s.15(2) is toensure that inherited property of a female Hindu dying issuelessand intestate, goes back to the source – s.15(1)(d) provides thatfailing all heirs of the female specified in Entries (a)-(c), but notuntil then, all her property howsoever acquired will devolve uponthe heirs of the father – The devolution upon the heirs of the fathershall be in the same order and according to the same rules as wouldhave applied if the property had belonged to the father and he haddied intestate in respect thereof immediately after her death –Applying the settled legal proposition to the facts of the case athands, since the succession of the suit properties opened in 1967upon death of Kupayee Ammal, the 1956 Act shall apply and therebyRamasamy Gounder’s daughter’s being Class-I heirs of their fathertoo shall also be heirs and entitled to 1/5th Share in each of the suitproperties.Hindu law: History and development – Hindus believe theirlaws to exist in the revelations preserved in ‘Vedas’, Shrutis (thatwhich are heard and revealed) and Smritis (that which is remembered)in contradiction to Shrutis – The Smritis comprise forensic law orthe Dharma Shastra and are believed to be recorded in the verywords of Lord Brahma – The Dharma Shastra or forensic Law is tobe found primarily in the institutes or collections known as‘Sanhitas’, Smritis or in other words, the text books attributed tothe learned scholarly sages, such as, Manu, Yajnavalchya, Vishnu,Parasara and Guatama, etc. – Their writings are considered by theHindus as authentic works – On these commentaries, digests andannotations have been written – The commentaries by variouslearned scholars have given rise to different schools of Hindu

        "content": "Hindu Succession Act, 1956: Self acquired property of maleHindu dying intestate – Right of daughter of such male Hindu toinherit – Held: If a property of a male Hindu dying intestate is aself acquired property or obtained in partition of a co-parceneryor a family property, the same would devolve by inheritance andnot by survivorship, and a daughter of such a male Hindu wouldbe entitled to inherit such property in preference to other collaterals– In the case at hands, since the property in question was admittedlythe self-acquired property of male Hindu despite the family beingin state of jointness upon his death intestate, his sole survivingdaughter will inherit the same by inheritance and the property shallnot devolve by survivorship.Hindu Succession Act, 1956: Scheme of the Act – Held: Themain scheme of this Act is to establish complete equality betweenmale and female with regard to property rights and the rights of thefemale were declared absolute, completely abolishing all notions ofa limited estate – The Act brought about changes in the law ofsuccession among Hindus and gave rights which were till thenunknown in relation to women’s property – The Act lays down auniform and comprehensive system of inheritance and applies, inter-alia, to persons governed by the Mitakshara and DayabhagaSchools and also to those governed previously by theMurumakkattayam, Aliyasantana and Nambudri Laws – The Actapplies to every person, who is a Hindu by religion in any of itsforms including a Virashaiva, a Lingayat or a follower of the BrahmoPararthana or Arya Samaj and even to any person who is Buddhist,Jain or Sikh by religion excepting one who is Muslim, Christian,Parsi or Jew or Sikh by religion.Hindu Succession Act, 1956: s.14 – Absolute right of femaleHindu – Held: s.14 of the Act of 1956 declares property of a femaleHindu to be her absolute property – The legislative intent of enactings.14(I) of the Act was to remedy the limitation of a Hindu womanwho could not claim absolute interest in the properties inherited byher but only had a life interest in the estate so inherited – s.14(1)converted all limited estates owned by women into absolute estatesand the succession of these properties in the absence of a will ortestament would take place in consonance with s.15 of the Act, 1956.Hindu Succession Act, 1956: s.15(2) – Purpose of enactment– Held: The basic aim of the legislature in enacting s.15(2) is toensure that inherited property of a female Hindu dying issuelessand intestate, goes back to the source – s.15(1)(d) provides thatfailing all heirs of the female specified in Entries (a)-(c), but notuntil then, all her property howsoever acquired will devolve uponthe heirs of the father – The devolution upon the heirs of the fathershall be in the same order and according to the same rules as wouldhave applied if the property had belonged to the father and he haddied intestate in respect thereof immediately after her death –Applying the settled legal proposition to the facts of the case athands, since the succession of the suit properties opened in 1967upon death of Kupayee Ammal, the 1956 Act shall apply and therebyRamasamy Gounder’s daughter’s being Class-I heirs of their fathertoo shall also be heirs and entitled to 1/5th Share in each of the suitproperties.Hindu law: History and development – Hindus believe theirlaws to exist in the revelations preserved in ‘Vedas’, Shrutis (thatwhich are heard and revealed) and Smritis (that which is remembered)in contradiction to Shrutis – The Smritis comprise forensic law orthe Dharma Shastra and are believed to be recorded in the verywords of Lord Brahma – The Dharma Shastra or forensic Law is tobe found primarily in the institutes or collections known as‘Sanhitas’, Smritis or in other words, the text books attributed tothe learned scholarly sages, such as, Manu, Yajnavalchya, Vishnu,Parasara and Guatama, etc. – Their writings are considered by theHindus as authentic works – On these commentaries, digests andannotations have been written – The commentaries by variouslearned scholars have given rise to different schools of Hindu Law- like Daya Bhaga in Bengal, Mayukha in Bombay, Konkan andGujarat and Marumakkattayam or Nambudri in Kerala andMitakshara in other parts of India – The Mitakshara school of lawis one of the most important schools of law having a very widejurisdiction – It applies to majority of India with slight variationswith the fundamental principles being the same – The Mitaksharahas always been

Arbitration: Arbitrator is the final arbiter of the disputes between the parties and it is not open to a party to challenge the Award on the ground that he has drawn his own conclusions or has failed to appreciate certain facts – It is beyond the jurisdiction of the Appellate Court to assign to itself, the task of construing the terms and conditions of the contract and its provisions and take a view on certain amounts awarded in favour of a party – As long as the Arbitrator has taken a possible view, which may be a plausible view, simply because a different view from that taken in the Award, is possible based on the same evidence, would also not be a ground to interfere in the Award – In the instant case, the Sole Arbitrator had given certain cogent reasons for awarding the amount in favour of the appellant-claimant towards idle hire charges of the parts of the machineries and equipments and loss of machinery – It was beyond the domain of the Appellate Court to have examined the reasonableness of the said reasons by reappreciating the evidence to arrive at a different conclusion – Having regard to the fact that amounts have been awarded in favour of the appellant-claimant on the above heads, based on the Report submitted to the Court by the Court Commissioner for valuing the tools and machinery andpremised on the formula offered by the appellant-claimant for arriving at the idle hire charges, both being undisputed, there is no good reason for the Appellate Court to have interfered in the manner it did – Arbitration Act, 1940. Disposing the appeal, the CourtHELD: 1.1 Court does not sit in appeal over an Award passed by an Arbitrator and the only grounds on which it can be challenged are those that have been specified in Sections 30 and 33 of the Arbitration Act, namely, when there is an error on the face of the Award or when the Arbitrator has mis-conducted himself or the proceedings. [Para 10][619-F-G; 620-A] NTPC Ltd. v. Deconar Services Pvt. Ltd. (2021) SCC Online SC 498 Food Corporation of India v. Sreekanth Transport (1999) 4 SCC 491 : [1999] 3 SCR 699; Kwality Manufacturing Corporation v. Central Warehousing Corporation (2009) 5 SCC 142; Assam State Electricity Board and Others v. Buildworth Private Limited (2017) 8 SCC 146 : [2017] 7 SCR 123– referred to. 1.2 It is also a well-settled principle of law that challenge cannot be laid to the Award only on the ground that the Arbitrator has drawn his own conclusion or failed to appreciate the relevant facts. Nor can the Court substitute its own view on the conclusion of law or facts as against those drawn by the Arbitrator, as if it is sitting in appeal. As long as the Arbitrator has taken a possible view, which may be a plausible view, simply because a different view from that taken in the Award, is possible based on the same evidence, would also not be a ground to interfere in the Award. [Paras 12, 13][621-B-C; 622-B-C] State of Rajasthan v. Puri Construction Co. Ltd. And Another (1994) 6 SCC 485 : [1994] 3 Suppl. SCR 616; Arosan Enterprises Ltd. v. Union of India and Another (1999) 9 SCC 449 : [1999] 2 Suppl. SCR 621, Municipal Corporation of Delhi v. Jagan Nath Ashok Kumar and Another (1987) 4 SCC 497 : [1988] 1 SCR 180 – referred t2.1 Once the Sole Arbitrator had interpreted the clauses of the contract by taking a particular view and had gone to great length to analyse several reasons offered by the appellant-claimant to justify its plea that it was entitled for extension of time to execute the contract, the Division Bench of the High Court ought not to have sat over the said decision as an Appellate Court and seek to substitute its view for that of the Arbitrator. [Para 20][626-E-F] 2.2 In the instant case, having gone through the Award, the Sole Arbitrator was lucid in his reasoning for taking a particular view on the interpretation of the terms and conditions of the contract between the parties. It was for this very reason that the Single Judge had forbore from interfering with the arbitral Award and dismissed the petition filed by the respondent-Union of India under Sections 30 and 33 of the 1940 Act. By going into the minute details of the evidence led before the Sole Arbitrator with a magnifying glass and the findings returned thereon, the Appellate Court has clearly transgressed the limitations placed on it. In any case, the reasons offered for taking such a view, are neither justified nor called for for interfering with the arbitral Award. The findings returned by the Sole Arbitrator endorsed by the Single Judge are accepted that there was sufficient justification for the appellant-claimant to have sought extension of time for completing the work and that the decision of the respondent-Union of India to terminate the contract, was not for legitimate reasons. [Paras 21, 22][626-F-H; 627-A-B] 3.1 The second argument concerns the amount that was awarded in favour of the appellant-claimant on account of idle hire charges and the value of its machinery and equipment lying at the site, that has been set aside in the impugned judgment. Though the appellant-claimant had sought compensation under several heads, the Sole Arbitrator granted it an amount of 15,35,40,785/- towards idle hire charges and for the value of the machinery, inclusive of interest upto 31 st May, 1999. The High Court appointed an Engineer to ascertain the availability of the different items and machineries and their value. The Engineer and Insurance Surveyor submitted a report, just after a year from the date of termination of the contract, stating inter alia that therewere 21 items of machinery available at the site and their collective market value was 2,72,95,000/- and that the condition of most of the machineries had deteriorated and they were no longer usable. The High Court allowed the appellant-claimant to remove 21 items of the machinery lying at the site, subject to it furnishing a bank guarantee for a sum of 2.73 crores within three weeks. Though permission was granted to the appellant-claimant to take delivery of the said machineries after furnishing a bank guarantee, it did not do so on taking a plea that when the respondent-Union of India was approached for inspection of the machineries and to verify tampering/missing parts, the latter had refused to prepare any inventory and had stated that the machineries and equipments will be released on a “as is where is basis”. The Sole Arbitrator observed that after termination of the contract of the appellant- claimant, the balance contract work was got completed by the respondent-Union of India through the Border Road Organization [BRO] on 23 rd December, 1995 and till that time, the tools and machinery had remained with the respondent-Union of India. [Paras 23, 24][627-B-C, E-H; 628-A-C] 3.2 Finding fault with the respondent-Union of India of having failed to mitigate the damages by handing back the tools and machineries to the appellant-claimant at least immediately after 23 rd December, 1995, in the arbitral Award held that the appellant-claimant was entitled to idle hire charges from 2 nd April, 1992, the date of termination of the contract, till 23 rd December, 1995, the date of completion of the balance contract work by the BRO. Relying on the report of the Valuer appointed by the Court to give a Report relating to the machineries at the site and their condition and valuation and further, noting that both sides had accepted the said Report, the Sole Arbitrator held that it was fairly considered it safe to rely on the said Report for purposes of assigning valuation to the tools and machinery. Even for purposes of computing the idle hire charges of the machineries for the period between 2 nd April, 1992 to 23 rd December, 1995, the calculation given by the appellant-claimant based on a particular formula, was not objected to by the respondent-Union of India. Premised on the said formula, a sum of 6,77,41,386/- was awarded in favour of the appellant-claimant towards idle hirecharges of machineries and equipment with interest payable @ 18% p.a. and a sum of 2,72,95,000/- was granted to the appellant- claimant towards the value of the tools and machineries totalling to a sum of 15,35,40,785/- inclusive of interest. [Para 25] [628-D-H] A 3.3 The Appellate Court has set aside the aforesaid claim by taking a view that the Sole Arbitrator lost sight of the fact that once the High Court had passed an order granting permission to the appellant-claimant to remove the equipment and machineries from the site in the proceedings initiated by it and still they were not removed, then it has none else to blame but itself for the situation. Holding that the Sole Arbitrator had misconducted himself by observing that the claimant “may be correct” in not taking the machineries without an inventory when they were available at the site, the Appellate Court held that the appellant- claimant was not entitled to any amount towards the value of the tools and machineries, having been awarded idle hire charges for the very same equipments. [Para 26][629-A-C] B 3.4 The aforesaid conclusion drawn by the Appellate Court is manifestly erroneous and flies in the face of the settled legal position that the Arbitrator is the final arbiter of the disputes between the parties and it is not open to a party to challenge the Award on the ground that he has drawn his own conclusions or has failed to appreciate certain facts. It is beyond the jurisdiction of the Appellate Court to assign to itself, the task of construing the terms and conditions of the contract and its provisions and take a view on certain amounts awarded in favour of a party. The Sole Arbitrator had given certain cogent reasons for awarding the amount in favour of the appellant-claimant towards idle hire charges of the parts of the machineries and equipments and loss of machinery. It was beyond the domain of the Appellate Court to have examined the reasonableness of the said reasons by reappreciating the evidence to arrive at a different conclusion. Having regard to the fact that amounts have been awarded in favour of the appellant-claimant on the above heads, based on the Report submitted to the Court by the Court Commissioner for valuing the tools and machinery and premised on the formula offered by the appellant-claimant for arriving at the idle hire charges, both being undisputed, there is no good reason for the Appellate Court to have interfered in the manner it did. [Para 27][629-C-G] 4. The terms and conditions of the contract referred by the respondent-Union of India, namely, Clauses 7, 11, 54 and 70 have been duly noted, discussed and declared as inapplicable to the fact situation by the Sole Arbitrator, by relying on the facts of the case, the conduct of the parties and some other material terms and conditions of the contract, which in his view disentitled the respondent-Union of India from claiming that it was justified in refusing to extend the time as prayed for by the appellant-claimant, to complete the project. Therefore the submission made on behalf of the respondent-Union of India that the Sole Arbitrator had misconducted himself is rejected. Having held so, none of the decisions cited on the aspect of “excepted matters” would be of any assistance to the respondent-Union of India. [Para 29] [630-B-D] ",

Disposing the appeal, the CourtHELD: 1.1 Court does not sit in appeal over an Award passed by an Arbitrator and the only grounds on which it can be challenged are those that have been specified in Sections 30 and 33 of the Arbitration Act, namely, when there is an error on the face of the Award or when the Arbitrator has mis-conducted himself or the proceedings. [Para 10][619-F-G; 620-A] NTPC Ltd. v. Deconar Services Pvt. Ltd. (2021) SCC Online SC 498 Food Corporation of India v. Sreekanth Transport (1999) 4 SCC 491 : [1999] 3 SCR 699; Kwality Manufacturing Corporation v. Central Warehousing Corporation (2009) 5 SCC 142; Assam State Electricity Board and Others v. Buildworth Private Limited (2017) 8 SCC 146 : [2017] 7 SCR 123– referred to. 1.2 It is also a well-settled principle of law that challenge cannot be laid to the Award only on the ground that the Arbitrator has drawn his own conclusion or failed to appreciate the relevant facts. Nor can the Court substitute its own view on the conclusion of law or facts as against those drawn by the Arbitrator, as if it is sitting in appeal. As long as the Arbitrator has taken a possible view, which may be a plausible view, simply because a different view from that taken in the Award, is possible based on the same evidence, would also not be a ground to interfere in the Award. [Paras 12, 13][621-B-C; 622-B-C] State of Rajasthan v. Puri Construction Co. Ltd. And Another (1994) 6 SCC 485 : [1994] 3 Suppl. SCR 616; Arosan Enterprises Ltd. v. Union of India and Another (1999) 9 SCC 449 : [1999] 2 Suppl. SCR 621, Municipal Corporation of Delhi v. Jagan Nath Ashok Kumar and Another (1987) 4 SCC 497 : [1988] 1 SCR 180 – referred t2.1 Once the Sole Arbitrator had interpreted the clauses of the contract by taking a particular view and had gone to great length to analyse several reasons offered by the appellant-claimant to justify its plea that it was entitled for extension of time to execute the contract, the Division Bench of the High Court ought not to have sat over the said decision as an Appellate Court and seek to substitute its view for that of the Arbitrator. [Para 20][626-E-F] 2.2 In the instant case, having gone through the Award, the Sole Arbitrator was lucid in his reasoning for taking a particular view on the interpretation of the terms and conditions of the contract between the parties. It was for this very reason that the Single Judge had forbore from interfering with the arbitral Award and dismissed the petition filed by the respondent-Union of India under Sections 30 and 33 of the 1940 Act. By going into the minute details of the evidence led before the Sole Arbitrator with a magnifying glass and the findings returned thereon, the Appellate Court has clearly transgressed the limitations placed on it. In any case, the reasons offered for taking such a view, are neither justified nor called for for interfering with the arbitral Award. The findings returned by the Sole Arbitrator endorsed by the Single Judge are accepted that there was sufficient justification for the appellant-claimant to have sought extension of time for completing the work and that the decision of the respondent-Union of India to terminate the contract, was not for legitimate reasons. [Paras 21, 22][626-F-H; 627-A-B] 3.1 The second argument concerns the amount that was awarded in favour of the appellant-claimant on account of idle hire charges and the value of its machinery and equipment lying at the site, that has been set aside in the impugned judgment. Though the appellant-claimant had sought compensation under several heads, the Sole Arbitrator granted it an amount of 15,35,40,785/- towards idle hire charges and for the value of the machinery, inclusive of interest upto 31 st May, 1999. The High Court appointed an Engineer to ascertain the availability of the different items and machineries and their value. The Engineer and Insurance Surveyor submitted a report, just after a year from the date of termination of the contract, stating inter alia that therewere 21 items of machinery available at the site and their collective market value was 2,72,95,000/- and that the condition of most of the machineries had deteriorated and they were no longer usable. The High Court allowed the appellant-claimant to remove 21 items of the machinery lying at the site, subject to it furnishing a bank guarantee for a sum of 2.73 crores within three weeks. Though permission was granted to the appellant-claimant to take delivery of the said machineries after furnishing a bank guarantee, it did not do so on taking a plea that when the respondent-Union of India was approached for inspection of the machineries and to verify tampering/missing parts, the latter had refused to prepare any inventory and had stated that the machineries and equipments will be released on a “as is where is basis”. The Sole Arbitrator observed that after termination of the contract of the appellant- claimant, the balance contract work was got completed by the respondent-Union of India through the Border Road Organization [BRO] on 23 rd December, 1995 and till that time, the tools and machinery had remained with the respondent-Union of India.

Relying on the report of the Valuer appointed by the Court to give a Report relating to the machineries at the site and their condition and valuation and further, noting that both sides had accepted the said Report, the Sole Arbitrator held that it was fairly considered it safe to rely on the said Report for purposes of assigning valuation to the tools and machinery.

[Para 26][629-A-C] B 3.4 The aforesaid conclusion drawn by the Appellate Court is manifestly erroneous and flies in the face of the settled legal position that the Arbitrator is the final arbiter of the disputes between the parties and it is not open to a party to challenge the Award on the ground that he has drawn his own conclusions or has failed to appreciate certain facts.

Disposing the appeal, the CourtHELD: 1.1 Court does not sit in appeal over an Award passed by an Arbitrator and the only grounds on which it can be challenged are those that have been specified in Sections 30 and 33 of the Arbitration Act, namely, when there is an error on the face of the Award or when the Arbitrator has mis-conducted himself or the proceedings. [Para 10][619-F-G; 620-A] NTPC Ltd. v. Deconar Services Pvt. Ltd. (2021) SCC Online SC 498 Food Corporation of India v. Sreekanth Transport (1999) 4 SCC 491 : [1999] 3 SCR 699; Kwality Manufacturing Corporation v. Central Warehousing Corporation (2009) 5 SCC 142; Assam State Electricity Board and Others v. Buildworth Private Limited (2017) 8 SCC 146 : [2017] 7 SCR 123– referred to. 1.2 It is also a well-settled principle of law that challenge cannot be laid to the Award only on the ground that the Arbitrator has drawn his own conclusion or failed to appreciate the relevant facts. Nor can the Court substitute its own view on the conclusion of law or facts as against those drawn by the Arbitrator, as if it is sitting in appeal. As long as the Arbitrator has taken a possible view, which may be a plausible view, simply because a different view from that taken in the Award, is possible based on the same evidence, would also not be a ground to interfere in the Award. [Paras 12, 13][621-B-C; 622-B-C] State of Rajasthan v. Puri Construction Co. Ltd. And Another (1994) 6 SCC 485 : [1994] 3 Suppl. SCR 616; Arosan Enterprises Ltd. v. Union of India and Another (1999) 9 SCC 449 : [1999] 2 Suppl. SCR 621, Municipal Corporation of Delhi v. Jagan Nath Ashok Kumar and Another (1987) 4 SCC 497 : [1988] 1 SCR 180 – referred t2.1 Once the Sole Arbitrator had interpreted the clauses of the contract by taking a particular view and had gone to great length to analyse several reasons offered by the appellant-claimant to justify its plea that it was entitled for extension of time to execute the contract, the Division Bench of the High Court ought not to have sat over the said decision as an Appellate Court and seek to substitute its view for that of the Arbitrator. [Para 20][626-E-F] 2.2 In the instant case, having gone through the Award, the Sole Arbitrator was lucid in his reasoning for taking a particular view on the interpretation of the terms and conditions of the contract between the parties. It was for this very reason that the Single Judge had forbore from interfering with the arbitral Award and dismissed the petition filed by the respondent-Union of India under Sections 30 and 33 of the 1940 Act. By going into the minute details of the evidence led before the Sole Arbitrator with a magnifying glass and the findings returned thereon, the Appellate Court has clearly transgressed the limitations placed on it. In any case, the reasons offered for taking such a view, are neither justified nor called for for interfering with the arbitral Award. The findings returned by the Sole Arbitrator endorsed by the Single Judge are accepted that there was sufficient justification for the appellant-claimant to have sought extension of time for completing the work and that the decision of the respondent-Union of India to terminate the contract, was not for legitimate reasons. [Paras 21, 22][626-F-H; 627-A-B] 3.1 The second argument concerns the amount that was awarded in favour of the appellant-claimant on account of idle hire charges and the value of its machinery and equipment lying at the site, that has been set aside in the impugned judgment. Though the appellant-claimant had sought compensation under several heads, the Sole Arbitrator granted it an amount of 15,35,40,785/- towards idle hire charges and for the value of the machinery, inclusive of interest upto 31 st May, 1999. The High Court appointed an Engineer to ascertain the availability of the different items and machineries and their value. The Engineer and Insurance Surveyor submitted a report, just after a year from the date of termination of the contract, stating inter alia that therewere 21 items of machinery available at the site and their collective market value was 2,72,95,000/- and that the condition of most of the machineries had deteriorated and they were no longer usable. The High Court allowed the appellant-claimant to remove 21 items of the machinery lying at the site, subject to it furnishing a bank guarantee for a sum of 2.73 crores within three weeks. Though permission was granted to the appellant-claimant to take delivery of the said machineries after furnishing a bank guarantee, it did not do so on taking a plea that when the respondent-Union of India was approached for inspection of the machineries and to verify tampering/missing parts, the latter had refused to prepare any inventory and had stated that the machineries and equipments will be released on a “as is where is basis”. The Sole Arbitrator observed that after termination of the contract of the appellant- claimant, the balance contract work was got completed by the respondent-Union of India through the Border Road Organization [BRO] on 23 rd December, 1995 and till that time, the tools and machinery had remained with the respondent-Union of India. [Paras 23, 24][627-B-C, E-H; 628-A-C] 3.2 Finding fault with the respondent-Union of India of having failed to mitigate the damages by handing back the tools and machineries to the appellant-claimant at least immediately after 23 rd December, 1995, in the arbitral Award held that the appellant-claimant was entitled to idle hire charges from 2 nd April, 1992, the date of termination of the contract, till 23 rd December, 1995, the date of completion of the balance contract work by the BRO. Relying on the report of the Valuer appointed by the Court to give a Report relating to the machineries at the site and their condition and valuation and further, noting that both sides had accepted the said Report, the Sole Arbitrator held that it was fairly considered it safe to rely on the said Report for purposes of assigning valuation to the tools and machinery. Even for purposes of computing the idle hire charges of the machineries for the period between 2 nd April, 1992 to 23 rd December, 1995, the calculation given by the appellant-claimant based on a particular formula, was not objected to by the respondent-Union of India. Premised on the said formula, a sum of 6,77,41,386/- was awarded in favour of the appellant-claimant towards idle hirecharges of machineries and equipment with interest payable @ 18% p.a. and a sum of 2,72,95,000/- was granted to the appellant- claimant towards the value of the tools and machineries totalling to a sum of 15,35,40,785/- inclusive of interest. [Para 25] [628-D-H] A 3.3 The Appellate Court has set aside the aforesaid claim by taking a view that the Sole Arbitrator lost sight of the fact that once the High Court had passed an order granting permission to the appellant-claimant to remove the equipment and machineries from the site in the proceedings initiated by it and still they were not removed, then it has none else to blame but itself for the situation. Holding that the Sole Arbitrator had misconducted himself by observing that the claimant “may be correct” in not taking the machineries without an inventory when they were available at the site, the Appellate Court held that the appellant- claimant was not entitled to any amount towards the value of the tools and machineries, having been awarded idle hire charges for the very same equipments. [Para 26][629-A-C] B 3.4 The aforesaid conclusion drawn by the Appellate Court is manifestly erroneous and flies in the face of the settled legal position that the Arbitrator is the final arbiter of the disputes between the parties and it is not open to a party to challenge the Award on the ground that he has drawn his own conclusions or has failed to appreciate certain facts. It is beyond the jurisdiction of the Appellate Court to assign to itself, the task of construing the terms and conditions of the contract and its provisions and take a view on certain amounts awarded in favour of a party. The Sole Arbitrator had given certain cogent reasons for awarding the amount in favour of the appellant-claimant towards idle hire charges of the parts of the machineries and equipments and loss of machinery. It was beyond the domain of the Appellate Court to have examined the reasonableness of the said reasons by reappreciating the evidence to arrive at a different conclusion. Having regard to the fact that amounts have been awarded in favour of the appellant-claimant on the above heads, based on the Report submitted to the Court by the Court Commissioner for valuing the tools and machinery and premised on the formula offered by the appellant-claimant for arriving at the idle hire charges, both being undisputed, there is no good reason for the Appellate Court to have interfered in the manner it did. [Para 27][629-C-G] 4. The terms and conditions of the contract referred by the respondent-Union of India, namely, Clauses 7, 11, 54 and 70 have been duly noted, discussed and declared as inapplicable to the fact situation by the Sole Arbitrator, by relying on the facts of the case, the conduct of the parties and some other material terms and conditions of the contract, which in his view disentitled the respondent-Union of India from claiming that it was justified in refusing to extend the time as prayed for by the appellant-claimant, to complete the project. Therefore the submission made on behalf of the respondent-Union of India that the Sole Arbitrator had misconducted himself is rejected. Having held so, none of the decisions cited on the aspect of “excepted matters” would be of any assistance to the respondent-Union of India. [Para 29] [630-B-D] ",

As long as the Arbitrator has taken a possible view, which may be a plausible view, simply because a different view from that taken in the Award, is possible based on the same evidence, would also not be a ground to interfere in the Award.

[Para 20][626-E-F] 2.2 In the instant case, having gone through the Award, the Sole Arbitrator was lucid in his reasoning for taking a particular view on the interpretation of the terms and conditions of the contract between the parties. It was for this very reason that the Single Judge had forbore from interfering with the arbitral Award and dismissed the petition filed by the respondent-Union of India under Sections 30 and 33 of the 1940 Act. By going into the minute details of the evidence led before the Sole Arbitrator with a magnifying glass and the findings returned thereon, the Appellate Court has clearly transgressed the limitations placed on it. In any case, the reasons offered for taking such a view, are neither justified nor called for for interfering with the arbitral Award. The findings returned by the Sole Arbitrator endorsed by the Single Judge are accepted that there was sufficient justification for the appellant-claimant to have sought extension of time for completing the work and that the decision of the respondent-Union of India to terminate the contract, was not for legitimate reasons. [Paras 21, 22][626-F-H; 627-A-B] 3.1 The second argument concerns the amount that was awarded in favour of the appellant-claimant on account of idle hire charges and the value of its machinery and equipment lying at the site, that has been set aside in the impugned judgment. Though the appellant-claimant had sought compensation under several heads, the Sole Arbitrator granted it an amount of 15,35,40,785/- towards idle hire charges and for the value of the machinery, inclusive of interest upto 31 st May, 1999. The High Court appointed an Engineer to ascertain the availability of the different items and machineries and their value. The Engineer and Insurance Surveyor submitted a report, just after a year from the date of termination of the contract, stating inter alia that therewere 21 items of machinery available at the site and their collective market value was 2,72,95,000/- and that the condition of most of the machineries had deteriorated and they were no longer usable. The High Court allowed the appellant-claimant to remove 21 items of the machinery lying at the site, subject to it furnishing a bank guarantee for a sum of 2.73 crores within three weeks. Though permission was granted to the appellant-claimant to take delivery of the said machineries after furnishing a bank guarantee, it did not do so on taking a plea that when the respondent-Union of India was approached for inspection of the machineries and to verify tampering/missing parts, the latter had refused to prepare any inventory and had stated that the machineries and equipments will be released on a “as is where is basis”. The Sole Arbitrator observed that after termination of the contract of the appellant- claimant, the balance contract work was got completed by the respondent-Union of India through the Border Road Organization [BRO] on 23 rd December, 1995 and till that time, the tools and machinery had remained with the respondent-Union of India. [Paras 23, 24][627-B-C, E-H; 628-A-C] 3.2 Finding fault with the respondent-Union of India of having failed to mitigate the damages by handing back the tools and machineries to the appellant-claimant at least immediately after 23 rd December, 1995, in the arbitral Award held that the appellant-claimant was entitled to idle hire charges from 2 nd April, 1992, the date of termination of the contract, till 23 rd December, 1995, the date of completion of the balance contract work by the BRO. Relying on the report of the Valuer appointed by the Court to give a Report relating to the machineries at the site and their condition and valuation and further, noting that both sides had accepted the said Report, the Sole Arbitrator held that it was fairly considered it safe to rely on the said Report for purposes of assigning valuation to the tools and machinery. Even for purposes of computing the idle hire charges of the machineries for the period between 2 nd April, 1992 to 23 rd December, 1995, the calculation given by the appellant-claimant based on a particular formula, was not objected to by the respondent-Union of India. Premised on the said formula, a sum of 6,77,41,386/- was awarded in favour of the appellant-claimant towards idle hirecharges of machineries and equipment with interest payable @ 18% p.a. and a sum of 2,72,95,000/- was granted to the appellant- claimant towards the value of the tools and machineries totalling to a sum of 15,35,40,785/- inclusive of interest. [Para 25] [628-D-H] A 3.3 The Appellate Court has set aside the aforesaid claim by taking a view that the Sole Arbitrator lost sight of the fact that once the High Court had passed an order granting permission to the appellant-claimant to remove the equipment and machineries from the site in the proceedings initiated by it and still they were not removed, then it has none else to blame but itself for the situation. Holding that the Sole Arbitrator had misconducted himself by observing that the claimant “may be correct” in not taking the machineries without an inventory when they were available at the site, the Appellate Court held that the appellant- claimant was not entitled to any amount towards the value of the tools and machineries, having been awarded idle hire charges for the very same equipments. [Para 26][629-A-C] B 3.4 The aforesaid conclusion drawn by the Appellate Court is manifestly erroneous and flies in the face of the settled legal position that the Arbitrator is the final arbiter of the disputes between the parties and it is not open to a party to challenge the Award on the ground that he has drawn his own conclusions or has failed to appreciate certain facts. It is beyond the jurisdiction of the Appellate Court to assign to itself, the task of construing the terms and conditions of the contract and its provisions and take a view on certain amounts awarded in favour of a party. The Sole Arbitrator had given certain cogent reasons for awarding the amount in favour of the appellant-claimant towards idle hire charges of the parts of the machineries and equipments and loss of machinery. It was beyond the domain of the Appellate Court to have examined the reasonableness of the said reasons by reappreciating the evidence to arrive at a different conclusion. Having regard to the fact that amounts have been awarded in favour of the appellant-claimant on the above heads, based on the Report submitted to the Court by the Court Commissioner for valuing the tools and machinery and premised on the formula offered by the appellant-claimant for arriving at the idle hire charges, both being undisputed, there is no good reason for the Appellate Court to have interfered in the manner it did. [Para 27][629-C-G] 4. The terms and conditions of the contract referred by the respondent-Union of India, namely, Clauses 7, 11, 54 and 70 have been duly noted, discussed and declared as inapplicable to the fact situation by the Sole Arbitrator, by relying on the facts of the case, the conduct of the parties and some other material terms and conditions of the contract, which in his view disentitled the respondent-Union of India from claiming that it was justified in refusing to extend the time as prayed for by the appellant-claimant, to complete the project. Therefore the submission made on behalf of the respondent-Union of India that the Sole Arbitrator had misconducted himself is rejected. Having held so, none of the decisions cited on the aspect of “excepted matters” would be of any assistance to the respondent-Union of India. [Para 29] [630-B-D] ",

[Paras 23, 24][627-B-C, E-H; 628-A-C] 3.2 Finding fault with the respondent-Union of India of having failed to mitigate the damages by handing back the tools and machineries to the appellant-claimant at least immediately after 23 rd December, 1995, in the arbitral Award held that the appellant-claimant was entitled to idle hire charges from 2 nd April, 1992, the date of termination of the contract, till 23 rd December, 1995, the date of completion of the balance contract work by the BRO. Relying on the report of the Valuer appointed by the Court to give a Report relating to the machineries at the site and their condition and valuation and further, noting that both sides had accepted the said Report, the Sole Arbitrator held that it was fairly considered it safe to rely on the said Report for purposes of assigning valuation to the tools and machinery. Even for purposes of computing the idle hire charges of the machineries for the period between 2 nd April, 1992 to 23 rd December, 1995, the calculation given by the appellant-claimant based on a particular formula, was not objected to by the respondent-Union of India. Premised on the said formula, a sum of 6,77,41,386/- was awarded in favour of the appellant-claimant towards idle hirecharges of machineries and equipment with interest payable @ 18% p.a. and a sum of 2,72,95,000/- was granted to the appellant- claimant towards the value of the tools and machineries totalling to a sum of 15,35,40,785/- inclusive of interest. [Para 25] [628-D-H] A 3.3 The Appellate Court has set aside the aforesaid claim by taking a view that the Sole Arbitrator lost sight of the fact that once the High Court had passed an order granting permission to the appellant-claimant to remove the equipment and machineries from the site in the proceedings initiated by it and still they were not removed, then it has none else to blame but itself for the situation. Holding that the Sole Arbitrator had misconducted himself by observing that the claimant “may be correct” in not taking the machineries without an inventory when they were available at the site, the Appellate Court held that the appellant- claimant was not entitled to any amount towards the value of the tools and machineries, having been awarded idle hire charges for the very same equipments. [Para 26][629-A-C] B 3.4 The aforesaid conclusion drawn by the Appellate Court is manifestly erroneous and flies in the face of the settled legal position that the Arbitrator is the final arbiter of the disputes between the parties and it is not open to a party to challenge the Award on the ground that he has drawn his own conclusions or has failed to appreciate certain facts. It is beyond the jurisdiction of the Appellate Court to assign to itself, the task of construing the terms and conditions of the contract and its provisions and take a view on certain amounts awarded in favour of a party. The Sole Arbitrator had given certain cogent reasons for awarding the amount in favour of the appellant-claimant towards idle hire charges of the parts of the machineries and equipments and loss of machinery. It was beyond the domain of the Appellate Court to have examined the reasonableness of the said reasons by reappreciating the evidence to arrive at a different conclusion. Having regard to the fact that amounts have been awarded in favour of the appellant-claimant on the above heads, based on the Report submitted to the Court by the Court Commissioner for valuing the tools and machinery and premised on the formula offered by the appellant-claimant for arriving at the idle hire charges, both being undisputed, there is no good reason for the Appellate Court to have interfered in the manner it did. [Para 27][629-C-G] 4. The terms and conditions of the contract referred by the respondent-Union of India, namely, Clauses 7, 11, 54 and 70 have been duly noted, discussed and declared as inapplicable to the fact situation by the Sole Arbitrator, by relying on the facts of the case, the conduct of the parties and some other material terms and conditions of the contract, which in his view disentitled the respondent-Union of India from claiming that it was justified in refusing to extend the time as prayed for by the appellant-claimant, to complete the project. Therefore the submission made on behalf of the respondent-Union of India that the Sole Arbitrator had misconducted himself is rejected. Having held so, none of the decisions cited on the aspect of “excepted matters” would be of any assistance to the respondent-Union of India. [Para 29] [630-B-D] ",

Disposing the appeal, the CourtHELD: 1.1 Court does not sit in appeal over an Award passed by an Arbitrator and the only grounds on which it can be challenged are those that have been specified in Sections 30 and 33 of the Arbitration Act, namely, when there is an error on the face of the Award or when the Arbitrator has mis-conducted himself or the proceedings.

As long as the Arbitrator has taken a possible view, which may be a plausible view, simply because a different view from that taken in the Award, is possible based on the same evidence, would also not be a ground to interfere in the Award.

Jagan Nath Ashok Kumar and Another (1987) 4 SCC 497 : [1988] 1 SCR 180 – referred t2.1 Once the Sole Arbitrator had interpreted the clauses of the contract by taking a particular view and had gone to great length to analyse several reasons offered by the appellant-claimant to justify its plea that it was entitled for extension of time to execute the contract, the Division Bench of the High Court ought not to have sat over the said decision as an Appellate Court and seek to substitute its view for that of the Arbitrator. [Para 20][626-E-F] 2.2 In the instant case, having gone through the Award, the Sole Arbitrator was lucid in his reasoning for taking a particular view on the interpretation of the terms and conditions of the contract between the parties. It was for this very reason that the Single Judge had forbore from interfering with the arbitral Award and dismissed the petition filed by the respondent-Union of India under Sections 30 and 33 of the 1940 Act. By going into the minute details of the evidence led before the Sole Arbitrator with a magnifying glass and the findings returned thereon, the Appellate Court has clearly transgressed the limitations placed on it. In any case, the reasons offered for taking such a view, are neither justified nor called for for interfering with the arbitral Award. The findings returned by the Sole Arbitrator endorsed by the Single Judge are accepted that there was sufficient justification for the appellant-claimant to have sought extension of time for completing the work and that the decision of the respondent-Union of India to terminate the contract, was not for legitimate reasons. [Paras 21, 22][626-F-H; 627-A-B] 3.1 The second argument concerns the amount that was awarded in favour of the appellant-claimant on account of idle hire charges and the value of its machinery and equipment lying at the site, that has been set aside in the impugned judgment. Though the appellant-claimant had sought compensation under several heads, the Sole Arbitrator granted it an amount of 15,35,40,785/- towards idle hire charges and for the value of the machinery, inclusive of interest upto 31 st May, 1999. The High Court appointed an Engineer to ascertain the availability of the different items and machineries and their value. The Engineer and Insurance Surveyor submitted a report, just after a year from the date of termination of the contract, stating inter alia that therewere 21 items of machinery available at the site and their collective market value was 2,72,95,000/- and that the condition of most of the machineries had deteriorated and they were no longer usable. The High Court allowed the appellant-claimant to remove 21 items of the machinery lying at the site, subject to it furnishing a bank guarantee for a sum of 2.73 crores within three weeks. Though permission was granted to the appellant-claimant to take delivery of the said machineries after furnishing a bank guarantee, it did not do so on taking a plea that when the respondent-Union of India was approached for inspection of the machineries and to verify tampering/missing parts, the latter had refused to prepare any inventory and had stated that the machineries and equipments will be released on a “as is where is basis”. The Sole Arbitrator observed that after termination of the contract of the appellant- claimant, the balance contract work was got completed by the respondent-Union of India through the Border Road Organization [BRO] on 23 rd December, 1995 and till that time, the tools and machinery had remained with the respondent-Union of India.

Relying on the report of the Valuer appointed by the Court to give a Report relating to the machineries at the site and their condition and valuation and further, noting that both sides had accepted the said Report, the Sole Arbitrator held that it was fairly considered it safe to rely on the said Report for purposes of assigning valuation to the tools and machinery.

[Para 25] [628-D-H] A 3.3 The Appellate Court has set aside the aforesaid claim by taking a view that the Sole Arbitrator lost sight of the fact that once the High Court had passed an order granting permission to the appellant-claimant to remove the equipment and machineries from the site in the proceedings initiated by it and still they were not removed, then it has none else to blame but itself for the situation. Holding that the Sole Arbitrator had misconducted himself by observing that the claimant “may be correct” in not taking the machineries without an inventory when they were available at the site, the Appellate Court held that the appellant- claimant was not entitled to any amount towards the value of the tools and machineries, having been awarded idle hire charges for the very same equipments. [Para 26][629-A-C] B 3.4 The aforesaid conclusion drawn by the Appellate Court is manifestly erroneous and flies in the face of the settled legal position that the Arbitrator is the final arbiter of the disputes between the parties and it is not open to a party to challenge the Award on the ground that he has drawn his own conclusions or has failed to appreciate certain facts.

[Para 27][629-C-G] 4. The terms and conditions of the contract referred by the respondent-Union of India, namely, Clauses 7, 11, 54 and 70 have been duly noted, discussed and declared as inapplicable to the fact situation by the Sole Arbitrator, by relying on the facts of the case, the conduct of the parties and some other material terms and conditions of the contract, which in his view disentitled the respondent-Union of India from claiming that it was justified in refusing to extend the time as prayed for by the appellant-claimant, to complete the project. Therefore the submission made on behalf of the respondent-Union of India that the Sole Arbitrator had misconducted himself is rejected.

Disposing the appeal, the CourtHELD: 1.1 Court does not sit in appeal over an Award passed by an Arbitrator and the only grounds on which it can be challenged are those that have been specified in Sections 30 and 33 of the Arbitration Act, namely, when there is an error on the face of the Award or when the Arbitrator has mis-conducted himself or the proceedings. [Para 10][619-F-G; 620-A] NTPC Ltd. v. Deconar Services Pvt. Ltd. (2021) SCC Online SC 498 Food Corporation of India v. Sreekanth Transport (1999) 4 SCC 491 : [1999] 3 SCR 699; Kwality Manufacturing Corporation v. Central Warehousing Corporation (2009) 5 SCC 142; Assam State Electricity Board and Others v. Buildworth Private Limited (2017) 8 SCC 146 : [2017] 7 SCR 123– referred to. 1.2 It is also a well-settled principle of law that challenge cannot be laid to the Award only on the ground that the Arbitrator has drawn his own conclusion or failed to appreciate the relevant facts. Nor can the Court substitute its own view on the conclusion of law or facts as against those drawn by the Arbitrator, as if it is sitting in appeal. As long as the Arbitrator has taken a possible view, which may be a plausible view, simply because a different view from that taken in the Award, is possible based on the same evidence, would also not be a ground to interfere in the Award. [Paras 12, 13][621-B-C; 622-B-C] State of Rajasthan v. Puri Construction Co. Ltd. And Another (1994) 6 SCC 485 : [1994] 3 Suppl. SCR 616; Arosan Enterprises Ltd. v. Union of India and Another (1999) 9 SCC 449 : [1999] 2 Suppl. SCR 621, Municipal Corporation of Delhi v. Jagan Nath Ashok Kumar and Another (1987) 4 SCC 497 : [1988] 1 SCR 180 – referred t2.1 Once the Sole Arbitrator had interpreted the clauses of the contract by taking a particular view and had gone to great length to analyse several reasons offered by the appellant-claimant to justify its plea that it was entitled for extension of time to execute the contract, the Division Bench of the High Court ought not to have sat over the said decision as an Appellate Court and seek to substitute its view for that of the Arbitrator. [Para 20][626-E-F] 2.2 In the instant case, having gone through the Award, the Sole Arbitrator was lucid in his reasoning for taking a particular view on the interpretation of the terms and conditions of the contract between the parties. It was for this very reason that the Single Judge had forbore from interfering with the arbitral Award and dismissed the petition filed by the respondent-Union of India under Sections 30 and 33 of the 1940 Act. By going into the minute details of the evidence led before the Sole Arbitrator with a magnifying glass and the findings returned thereon, the Appellate Court has clearly transgressed the limitations placed on it. In any case, the reasons offered for taking such a view, are neither justified nor called for for interfering with the arbitral Award. The findings returned by the Sole Arbitrator endorsed by the Single Judge are accepted that there was sufficient justification for the appellant-claimant to have sought extension of time for completing the work and that the decision of the respondent-Union of India to terminate the contract, was not for legitimate reasons. [Paras 21, 22][626-F-H; 627-A-B] 3.1 The second argument concerns the amount that was awarded in favour of the appellant-claimant on account of idle hire charges and the value of its machinery and equipment lying at the site, that has been set aside in the impugned judgment. Though the appellant-claimant had sought compensation under several heads, the Sole Arbitrator granted it an amount of 15,35,40,785/- towards idle hire charges and for the value of the machinery, inclusive of interest upto 31 st May, 1999. The High Court appointed an Engineer to ascertain the availability of the different items and machineries and their value. The Engineer and Insurance Surveyor submitted a report, just after a year from the date of termination of the contract, stating inter alia that therewere 21 items of machinery available at the site and their collective market value was 2,72,95,000/- and that the condition of most of the machineries had deteriorated and they were no longer usable. The High Court allowed the appellant-claimant to remove 21 items of the machinery lying at the site, subject to it furnishing a bank guarantee for a sum of 2.73 crores within three weeks. Though permission was granted to the appellant-claimant to take delivery of the said machineries after furnishing a bank guarantee, it did not do so on taking a plea that when the respondent-Union of India was approached for inspection of the machineries and to verify tampering/missing parts, the latter had refused to prepare any inventory and had stated that the machineries and equipments will be released on a “as is where is basis”. The Sole Arbitrator observed that after termination of the contract of the appellant- claimant, the balance contract work was got completed by the respondent-Union of India through the Border Road Organization [BRO] on 23 rd December, 1995 and till that time, the tools and machinery had remained with the respondent-Union of India. [Paras 23, 24][627-B-C, E-H; 628-A-C] 3.2 Finding fault with the respondent-Union of India of having failed to mitigate the damages by handing back the tools and machineries to the appellant-claimant at least immediately after 23 rd December, 1995, in the arbitral Award held that the appellant-claimant was entitled to idle hire charges from 2 nd April, 1992, the date of termination of the contract, till 23 rd December, 1995, the date of completion of the balance contract work by the BRO. Relying on the report of the Valuer appointed by the Court to give a Report relating to the machineries at the site and their condition and valuation and further, noting that both sides had accepted the said Report, the Sole Arbitrator held that it was fairly considered it safe to rely on the said Report for purposes of assigning valuation to the tools and machinery. Even for purposes of computing the idle hire charges of the machineries for the period between 2 nd April, 1992 to 23 rd December, 1995, the calculation given by the appellant-claimant based on a particular formula, was not objected to by the respondent-Union of India. Premised on the said formula, a sum of 6,77,41,386/- was awarded in favour of the appellant-claimant towards idle hirecharges of machineries and equipment with interest payable @ 18% p.a. and a sum of 2,72,95,000/- was granted to the appellant- claimant towards the value of the tools and machineries totalling to a sum of 15,35,40,785/- inclusive of interest. [Para 25] [628-D-H] A 3.3 The Appellate Court has set aside the aforesaid claim by taking a view that the Sole Arbitrator lost sight of the fact that once the High Court had passed an order granting permission to the appellant-claimant to remove the equipment and machineries from the site in the proceedings initiated by it and still they were not removed, then it has none else to blame but itself for the situation. Holding that the Sole Arbitrator had misconducted himself by observing that the claimant “may be correct” in not taking the machineries without an inventory when they were available at the site, the Appellate Court held that the appellant- claimant was not entitled to any amount towards the value of the tools and machineries, having been awarded idle hire charges for the very same equipments. [Para 26][629-A-C] B 3.4 The aforesaid conclusion drawn by the Appellate Court is manifestly erroneous and flies in the face of the settled legal position that the Arbitrator is the final arbiter of the disputes between the parties and it is not open to a party to challenge the Award on the ground that he has drawn his own conclusions or has failed to appreciate certain facts. It is beyond the jurisdiction of the Appellate Court to assign to itself, the task of construing the terms and conditions of the contract and its provisions and take a view on certain amounts awarded in favour of a party. The Sole Arbitrator had given certain cogent reasons for awarding the amount in favour of the appellant-claimant towards idle hire charges of the parts of the machineries and equipments and loss of machinery. It was beyond the domain of the Appellate Court to have examined the reasonableness of the said reasons by reappreciating the evidence to arrive at a different conclusion. Having regard to the fact that amounts have been awarded in favour of the appellant-claimant on the above heads, based on the Report submitted to the Court by the Court Commissioner for valuing the tools and machinery and premised on the formula offered by the appellant-claimant for arriving at the idle hire charges, both being undisputed, there is no good reason for the Appellate Court to have interfered in the manner it did. [Para 27][629-C-G] 4. The terms and conditions of the contract referred by the respondent-Union of India, namely, Clauses 7, 11, 54 and 70 have been duly noted, discussed and declared as inapplicable to the fact situation by the Sole Arbitrator, by relying on the facts of the case, the conduct of the parties and some other material terms and conditions of the contract, which in his view disentitled the respondent-Union of India from claiming that it was justified in refusing to extend the time as prayed for by the appellant-claimant, to complete the project. Therefore the submission made on behalf of the respondent-Union of India that the Sole Arbitrator had misconducted himself is rejected. Having held so, none of the decisions cited on the aspect of “excepted matters” would be of any assistance to the respondent-Union of India. [Para 29] [630-B-D] ",

Nor can the Court substitute its own view on the conclusion of law or facts as against those drawn by the Arbitrator, as if it is sitting in appeal. As long as the Arbitrator has taken a possible view, which may be a plausible view, simply because a different view from that taken in the Award, is possible based on the same evidence, would also not be a ground to interfere in the Award. [Paras 12, 13][621-B-C; 622-B-C] State of Rajasthan v. Puri Construction Co. Ltd. And Another (1994) 6 SCC 485 : [1994] 3 Suppl. SCR 616; Arosan Enterprises Ltd. v. Union of India and Another (1999) 9 SCC 449 : [1999] 2 Suppl. SCR 621, Municipal Corporation of Delhi v. Jagan Nath Ashok Kumar and Another (1987) 4 SCC 497 : [1988] 1 SCR 180 – referred t2.1 Once the Sole Arbitrator had interpreted the clauses of the contract by taking a particular view and had gone to great length to analyse several reasons offered by the appellant-claimant to justify its plea that it was entitled for extension of time to execute the contract, the Division Bench of the High Court ought not to have sat over the said decision as an Appellate Court and seek to substitute its view for that of the Arbitrator. [Para 20][626-E-F] 2.2 In the instant case, having gone through the Award, the Sole Arbitrator was lucid in his reasoning for taking a particular view on the interpretation of the terms and conditions of the contract between the parties. It was for this very reason that the Single Judge had forbore from interfering with the arbitral Award and dismissed the petition filed by the respondent-Union of India under Sections 30 and 33 of the 1940 Act. By going into the minute details of the evidence led before the Sole Arbitrator with a magnifying glass and the findings returned thereon, the Appellate Court has clearly transgressed the limitations placed on it. In any case, the reasons offered for taking such a view, are neither justified nor called for for interfering with the arbitral Award. The findings returned by the Sole Arbitrator endorsed by the Single Judge are accepted that there was sufficient justification for the appellant-claimant to have sought extension of time for completing the work and that the decision of the respondent-Union of India to terminate the contract, was not for legitimate reasons. [Paras 21, 22][626-F-H; 627-A-B] 3.1 The second argument concerns the amount that was awarded in favour of the appellant-claimant on account of idle hire charges and the value of its machinery and equipment lying at the site, that has been set aside in the impugned judgment. Though the appellant-claimant had sought compensation under several heads, the Sole Arbitrator granted it an amount of 15,35,40,785/- towards idle hire charges and for the value of the machinery, inclusive of interest upto 31 st May, 1999. The High Court appointed an Engineer to ascertain the availability of the different items and machineries and their value. The Engineer and Insurance Surveyor submitted a report, just after a year from the date of termination of the contract, stating inter alia that therewere 21 items of machinery available at the site and their collective market value was 2,72,95,000/- and that the condition of most of the machineries had deteriorated and they were no longer usable. The High Court allowed the appellant-claimant to remove 21 items of the machinery lying at the site, subject to it furnishing a bank guarantee for a sum of 2.73 crores within three weeks. Though permission was granted to the appellant-claimant to take delivery of the said machineries after furnishing a bank guarantee, it did not do so on taking a plea that when the respondent-Union of India was approached for inspection of the machineries and to verify tampering/missing parts, the latter had refused to prepare any inventory and had stated that the machineries and equipments will be released on a “as is where is basis”. The Sole Arbitrator observed that after termination of the contract of the appellant- claimant, the balance contract work was got completed by the respondent-Union of India through the Border Road Organization [BRO] on 23 rd December, 1995 and till that time, the tools and machinery had remained with the respondent-Union of India. [Paras 23, 24][627-B-C, E-H; 628-A-C] 3.2 Finding fault with the respondent-Union of India of having failed to mitigate the damages by handing back the tools and machineries to the appellant-claimant at least immediately after 23 rd December, 1995, in the arbitral Award held that the appellant-claimant was entitled to idle hire charges from 2 nd April, 1992, the date of termination of the contract, till 23 rd December, 1995, the date of completion of the balance contract work by the BRO. Relying on the report of the Valuer appointed by the Court to give a Report relating to the machineries at the site and their condition and valuation and further, noting that both sides had accepted the said Report, the Sole Arbitrator held that it was fairly considered it safe to rely on the said Report for purposes of assigning valuation to the tools and machinery. Even for purposes of computing the idle hire charges of the machineries for the period between 2 nd April, 1992 to 23 rd December, 1995, the calculation given by the appellant-claimant based on a particular formula, was not objected to by the respondent-Union of India. Premised on the said formula, a sum of 6,77,41,386/- was awarded in favour of the appellant-claimant towards idle hirecharges of machineries and equipment with interest payable @ 18% p.a. and a sum of 2,72,95,000/- was granted to the appellant- claimant towards the value of the tools and machineries totalling to a sum of 15,35,40,785/- inclusive of interest. [Para 25] [628-D-H] A 3.3 The Appellate Court has set aside the aforesaid claim by taking a view that the Sole Arbitrator lost sight of the fact that once the High Court had passed an order granting permission to the appellant-claimant to remove the equipment and machineries from the site in the proceedings initiated by it and still they were not removed, then it has none else to blame but itself for the situation. Holding that the Sole Arbitrator had misconducted himself by observing that the claimant “may be correct” in not taking the machineries without an inventory when they were available at the site, the Appellate Court held that the appellant- claimant was not entitled to any amount towards the value of the tools and machineries, having been awarded idle hire charges for the very same equipments. [Para 26][629-A-C] B 3.4 The aforesaid conclusion drawn by the Appellate Court is manifestly erroneous and flies in the face of the settled legal position that the Arbitrator is the final arbiter of the disputes between the parties and it is not open to a party to challenge the Award on the ground that he has drawn his own conclusions or has failed to appreciate certain facts. It is beyond the jurisdiction of the Appellate Court to assign to itself, the task of construing the terms and conditions of the contract and its provisions and take a view on certain amounts awarded in favour of a party. The Sole Arbitrator had given certain cogent reasons for awarding the amount in favour of the appellant-claimant towards idle hire charges of the parts of the machineries and equipments and loss of machinery. It was beyond the domain of the Appellate Court to have examined the reasonableness of the said reasons by reappreciating the evidence to arrive at a different conclusion. Having regard to the fact that amounts have been awarded in favour of the appellant-claimant on the above heads, based on the Report submitted to the Court by the Court Commissioner for valuing the tools and machinery and premised on the formula offered by the appellant-claimant for arriving at the idle hire charges, both being undisputed, there is no good reason for the Appellate Court to have interfered in the manner it did. [Para 27][629-C-G] 4. The terms and conditions of the contract referred by the respondent-Union of India, namely, Clauses 7, 11, 54 and 70 have been duly noted, discussed and declared as inapplicable to the fact situation by the Sole Arbitrator, by relying on the facts of the case, the conduct of the parties and some other material terms and conditions of the contract, which in his view disentitled the respondent-Union of India from claiming that it was justified in refusing to extend the time as prayed for by the appellant-claimant, to complete the project. Therefore the submission made on behalf of the respondent-Union of India that the Sole Arbitrator had misconducted himself is rejected. Having held so, none of the decisions cited on the aspect of “excepted matters” would be of any assistance to the respondent-Union of India. [Para 29] [630-B-D] ",

Holding that the Sole Arbitrator had misconducted himself by observing that the claimant “may be correct” in not taking the machineries without an inventory when they were available at the site, the Appellate Court held that the appellant- claimant was not entitled to any amount towards the value of the tools and machineries, having been awarded idle hire charges for the very same equipments. [Para 26][629-A-C] B 3.4 The aforesaid conclusion drawn by the Appellate Court is manifestly erroneous and flies in the face of the settled legal position that the Arbitrator is the final arbiter of the disputes between the parties and it is not open to a party to challenge the Award on the ground that he has drawn his own conclusions or has failed to appreciate certain facts. It is beyond the jurisdiction of the Appellate Court to assign to itself, the task of construing the terms and conditions of the contract and its provisions and take a view on certain amounts awarded in favour of a party. The Sole Arbitrator had given certain cogent reasons for awarding the amount in favour of the appellant-claimant towards idle hire charges of the parts of the machineries and equipments and loss of machinery. It was beyond the domain of the Appellate Court to have examined the reasonableness of the said reasons by reappreciating the evidence to arrive at a different conclusion. Having regard to the fact that amounts have been awarded in favour of the appellant-claimant on the above heads, based on the Report submitted to the Court by the Court Commissioner for valuing the tools and machinery and premised on the formula offered by the appellant-claimant for arriving at the idle hire charges, both being undisputed, there is no good reason for the Appellate Court to have interfered in the manner it did. [Para 27][629-C-G] 4. The terms and conditions of the contract referred by the respondent-Union of India, namely, Clauses 7, 11, 54 and 70 have been duly noted, discussed and declared as inapplicable to the fact situation by the Sole Arbitrator, by relying on the facts of the case, the conduct of the parties and some other material terms and conditions of the contract, which in his view disentitled the respondent-Union of India from claiming that it was justified in refusing to extend the time as prayed for by the appellant-claimant, to complete the project. Therefore the submission made on behalf of the respondent-Union of India that the Sole Arbitrator had misconducted himself is rejected. Having held so, none of the decisions cited on the aspect of “excepted matters” would be of any assistance to the respondent-Union of India. [Para 29] [630-B-D] ",

Disposing the appeal, the CourtHELD: 1.1 Court does not sit in appeal over an Award passed by an Arbitrator and the only grounds on which it can be challenged are those that have been specified in Sections 30 and 33 of the Arbitration Act, namely, when there is an error on the face of the Award or when the Arbitrator has mis-conducted himself or the proceedings. [Para 10][619-F-G; 620-A] NTPC Ltd. v. Deconar Services Pvt. Ltd. (2021) SCC Online SC 498 Food Corporation of India v. Sreekanth Transport (1999) 4 SCC 491 : [1999] 3 SCR 699; Kwality Manufacturing Corporation v. Central Warehousing Corporation (2009) 5 SCC 142; Assam State Electricity Board and Others v.

Nor can the Court substitute its own view on the conclusion of law or facts as against those drawn by the Arbitrator, as if it is sitting in appeal. As long as the Arbitrator has taken a possible view, which may be a plausible view, simply because a different view from that taken in the Award, is possible based on the same evidence, would also not be a ground to interfere in the Award. [Paras 12, 13][621-B-C; 622-B-C] State of Rajasthan v. Puri Construction Co. Ltd. And Another (1994) 6 SCC 485 : [1994] 3 Suppl. SCR 616; Arosan Enterprises Ltd. v.

[Para 20][626-E-F] 2.2 In the instant case, having gone through the Award, the Sole Arbitrator was lucid in his reasoning for taking a particular view on the interpretation of the terms and conditions of the contract between the parties. It was for this very reason that the Single Judge had forbore from interfering with the arbitral Award and dismissed the petition filed by the respondent-Union of India under Sections 30 and 33 of the 1940 Act. By going into the minute details of the evidence led before the Sole Arbitrator with a magnifying glass and the findings returned thereon, the Appellate Court has clearly transgressed the limitations placed on it. In any case, the reasons offered for taking such a view, are neither justified nor called for for interfering with the arbitral Award. The findings returned by the Sole Arbitrator endorsed by the Single Judge are accepted that there was sufficient justification for the appellant-claimant to have sought extension of time for completing the work and that the decision of the respondent-Union of India to terminate the contract, was not for legitimate reasons. [Paras 21, 22][626-F-H; 627-A-B] 3.1 The second argument concerns the amount that was awarded in favour of the appellant-claimant on account of idle hire charges and the value of its machinery and equipment lying at the site, that has been set aside in the impugned judgment. Though the appellant-claimant had sought compensation under several heads, the Sole Arbitrator granted it an amount of 15,35,40,785/- towards idle hire charges and for the value of the machinery, inclusive of interest upto 31 st May, 1999. The High Court appointed an Engineer to ascertain the availability of the different items and machineries and their value. The Engineer and Insurance Surveyor submitted a report, just after a year from the date of termination of the contract, stating inter alia that therewere 21 items of machinery available at the site and their collective market value was 2,72,95,000/- and that the condition of most of the machineries had deteriorated and they were no longer usable. The High Court allowed the appellant-claimant to remove 21 items of the machinery lying at the site, subject to it furnishing a bank guarantee for a sum of 2.73 crores within three weeks. Though permission was granted to the appellant-claimant to take delivery of the said machineries after furnishing a bank guarantee, it did not do so on taking a plea that when the respondent-Union of India was approached for inspection of the machineries and to verify tampering/missing parts, the latter had refused to prepare any inventory and had stated that the machineries and equipments will be released on a “as is where is basis”. The Sole Arbitrator observed that after termination of the contract of the appellant- claimant, the balance contract work was got completed by the respondent-Union of India through the Border Road Organization [BRO] on 23 rd December, 1995 and till that time, the tools and machinery had remained with the respondent-Union of India. [Paras 23, 24][627-B-C, E-H; 628-A-C] 3.2 Finding fault with the respondent-Union of India of having failed to mitigate the damages by handing back the tools and machineries to the appellant-claimant at least immediately after 23 rd December, 1995, in the arbitral Award held that the appellant-claimant was entitled to idle hire charges from 2 nd April, 1992, the date of termination of the contract, till 23 rd December, 1995, the date of completion of the balance contract work by the BRO. Relying on the report of the Valuer appointed by the Court to give a Report relating to the machineries at the site and their condition and valuation and further, noting that both sides had accepted the said Report, the Sole Arbitrator held that it was fairly considered it safe to rely on the said Report for purposes of assigning valuation to the tools and machinery. Even for purposes of computing the idle hire charges of the machineries for the period between 2 nd April, 1992 to 23 rd December, 1995, the calculation given by the appellant-claimant based on a particular formula, was not objected to by the respondent-Union of India. Premised on the said formula, a sum of 6,77,41,386/- was awarded in favour of the appellant-claimant towards idle hirecharges of machineries and equipment with interest payable @ 18% p.a. and a sum of 2,72,95,000/- was granted to the appellant- claimant towards the value of the tools and machineries totalling to a sum of 15,35,40,785/- inclusive of interest. [Para 25] [628-D-H] A 3.3 The Appellate Court has set aside the aforesaid claim by taking a view that the Sole Arbitrator lost sight of the fact that once the High Court had passed an order granting permission to the appellant-claimant to remove the equipment and machineries from the site in the proceedings initiated by it and still they were not removed, then it has none else to blame but itself for the situation. Holding that the Sole Arbitrator had misconducted himself by observing that the claimant “may be correct” in not taking the machineries without an inventory when they were available at the site, the Appellate Court held that the appellant- claimant was not entitled to any amount towards the value of the tools and machineries, having been awarded idle hire charges for the very same equipments. [Para 26][629-A-C] B 3.4 The aforesaid conclusion drawn by the Appellate Court is manifestly erroneous and flies in the face of the settled legal position that the Arbitrator is the final arbiter of the disputes between the parties and it is not open to a party to challenge the Award on the ground that he has drawn his own conclusions or has failed to appreciate certain facts. It is beyond the jurisdiction of the Appellate Court to assign to itself, the task of construing the terms and conditions of the contract and its provisions and take a view on certain amounts awarded in favour of a party. The Sole Arbitrator had given certain cogent reasons for awarding the amount in favour of the appellant-claimant towards idle hire charges of the parts of the machineries and equipments and loss of machinery. It was beyond the domain of the Appellate Court to have examined the reasonableness of the said reasons by reappreciating the evidence to arrive at a different conclusion. Having regard to the fact that amounts have been awarded in favour of the appellant-claimant on the above heads, based on the Report submitted to the Court by the Court Commissioner for valuing the tools and machinery and premised on the formula offered by the appellant-claimant for arriving at the idle hire charges, both being undisputed, there is no good reason for the Appellate Court to have interfered in the manner it did. [Para 27][629-C-G] 4. The terms and conditions of the contract referred by the respondent-Union of India, namely, Clauses 7, 11, 54 and 70 have been duly noted, discussed and declared as inapplicable to the fact situation by the Sole Arbitrator, by relying on the facts of the case, the conduct of the parties and some other material terms and conditions of the contract, which in his view disentitled the respondent-Union of India from claiming that it was justified in refusing to extend the time as prayed for by the appellant-claimant, to complete the project. Therefore the submission made on behalf of the respondent-Union of India that the Sole Arbitrator had misconducted himself is rejected. Having held so, none of the decisions cited on the aspect of “excepted matters” would be of any assistance to the respondent-Union of India. [Para 29] [630-B-D] ",

[Para 10][619-F-G; 620-A] NTPC Ltd. v. Deconar Services Pvt. Ltd. (2021) SCC Online SC 498 Food Corporation of India v. Sreekanth Transport (1999) 4 SCC 491 : [1999] 3 SCR 699; Kwality Manufacturing Corporation v. Central Warehousing Corporation (2009) 5 SCC 142; Assam State Electricity Board and Others v.

Nor can the Court substitute its own view on the conclusion of law or facts as against those drawn by the Arbitrator, as if it is sitting in appeal. As long as the Arbitrator has taken a possible view, which may be a plausible view, simply because a different view from that taken in the Award, is possible based on the same evidence, would also not be a ground to interfere in the Award. [Paras 12, 13][621-B-C; 622-B-C] State of Rajasthan v. Puri Construction Co. Ltd. And Another (1994) 6 SCC 485 : [1994] 3 Suppl. SCR 616; Arosan Enterprises Ltd. v. Union of India and Another (1999) 9 SCC 449 : [1999] 2 Suppl. SCR 621, Municipal Corporation of Delhi v. Jagan Nath Ashok Kumar and Another (1987) 4 SCC 497 : [1988] 1 SCR 180 – referred t2.1 Once the Sole Arbitrator had interpreted the clauses of the contract by taking a particular view and had gone to great length to analyse several reasons offered by the appellant-claimant to justify its plea that it was entitled for extension of time to execute the contract, the Division Bench of the High Court ought not to have sat over the said decision as an Appellate Court and seek to substitute its view for that of the Arbitrator. [Para 20][626-E-F] 2.2 In the instant case, having gone through the Award, the Sole Arbitrator was lucid in his reasoning for taking a particular view on the interpretation of the terms and conditions of the contract between the parties. It was for this very reason that the Single Judge had forbore from interfering with the arbitral Award and dismissed the petition filed by the respondent-Union of India under Sections 30 and 33 of the 1940 Act. By going into the minute details of the evidence led before the Sole Arbitrator with a magnifying glass and the findings returned thereon, the Appellate Court has clearly transgressed the limitations placed on it. In any case, the reasons offered for taking such a view, are neither justified nor called for for interfering with the arbitral Award. The findings returned by the Sole Arbitrator endorsed by the Single Judge are accepted that there was sufficient justification for the appellant-claimant to have sought extension of time for completing the work and that the decision of the respondent-Union of India to terminate the contract, was not for legitimate reasons. [Paras 21, 22][626-F-H; 627-A-B] 3.1 The second argument concerns the amount that was awarded in favour of the appellant-claimant on account of idle hire charges and the value of its machinery and equipment lying at the site, that has been set aside in the impugned judgment. Though the appellant-claimant had sought compensation under several heads, the Sole Arbitrator granted it an amount of 15,35,40,785/- towards idle hire charges and for the value of the machinery, inclusive of interest upto 31 st May, 1999. The High Court appointed an Engineer to ascertain the availability of the different items and machineries and their value. The Engineer and Insurance Surveyor submitted a report, just after a year from the date of termination of the contract, stating inter alia that therewere 21 items of machinery available at the site and their collective market value was 2,72,95,000/- and that the condition of most of the machineries had deteriorated and they were no longer usable. The High Court allowed the appellant-claimant to remove 21 items of the machinery lying at the site, subject to it furnishing a bank guarantee for a sum of 2.73 crores within three weeks. Though permission was granted to the appellant-claimant to take delivery of the said machineries after furnishing a bank guarantee, it did not do so on taking a plea that when the respondent-Union of India was approached for inspection of the machineries and to verify tampering/missing parts, the latter had refused to prepare any inventory and had stated that the machineries and equipments will be released on a “as is where is basis”. The Sole Arbitrator observed that after termination of the contract of the appellant- claimant, the balance contract work was got completed by the respondent-Union of India through the Border Road Organization [BRO] on 23 rd December, 1995 and till that time, the tools and machinery had remained with the respondent-Union of India. [Paras 23, 24][627-B-C, E-H; 628-A-C] 3.2 Finding fault with the respondent-Union of India of having failed to mitigate the damages by handing back the tools and machineries to the appellant-claimant at least immediately after 23 rd December, 1995, in the arbitral Award held that the appellant-claimant was entitled to idle hire charges from 2 nd April, 1992, the date of termination of the contract, till 23 rd December, 1995, the date of completion of the balance contract work by the BRO. Relying on the report of the Valuer appointed by the Court to give a Report relating to the machineries at the site and their condition and valuation and further, noting that both sides had accepted the said Report, the Sole Arbitrator held that it was fairly considered it safe to rely on the said Report for purposes of assigning valuation to the tools and machinery. Even for purposes of computing the idle hire charges of the machineries for the period between 2 nd April, 1992 to 23 rd December, 1995, the calculation given by the appellant-claimant based on a particular formula, was not objected to by the respondent-Union of India. Premised on the said formula, a sum of 6,77,41,386/- was awarded in favour of the appellant-claimant towards idle hirecharges of machineries and equipment with interest payable @ 18% p.a. and a sum of 2,72,95,000/- was granted to the appellant- claimant towards the value of the tools and machineries totalling to a sum of 15,35,40,785/- inclusive of interest. [Para 25] [628-D-H] A 3.3 The Appellate Court has set aside the aforesaid claim by taking a view that the Sole Arbitrator lost sight of the fact that once the High Court had passed an order granting permission to the appellant-claimant to remove the equipment and machineries from the site in the proceedings initiated by it and still they were not removed, then it has none else to blame but itself for the situation. Holding that the Sole Arbitrator had misconducted himself by observing that the claimant “may be correct” in not taking the machineries without an inventory when they were available at the site, the Appellate Court held that the appellant- claimant was not entitled to any amount towards the value of the tools and machineries, having been awarded idle hire charges for the very same equipments. [Para 26][629-A-C] B 3.4 The aforesaid conclusion drawn by the Appellate Court is manifestly erroneous and flies in the face of the settled legal position that the Arbitrator is the final arbiter of the disputes between the parties and it is not open to a party to challenge the Award on the ground that he has drawn his own conclusions or has failed to appreciate certain facts. It is beyond the jurisdiction of the Appellate Court to assign to itself, the task of construing the terms and conditions of the contract and its provisions and take a view on certain amounts awarded in favour of a party. The Sole Arbitrator had given certain cogent reasons for awarding the amount in favour of the appellant-claimant towards idle hire charges of the parts of the machineries and equipments and loss of machinery. It was beyond the domain of the Appellate Court to have examined the reasonableness of the said reasons by reappreciating the evidence to arrive at a different conclusion. Having regard to the fact that amounts have been awarded in favour of the appellant-claimant on the above heads, based on the Report submitted to the Court by the Court Commissioner for valuing the tools and machinery and premised on the formula offered by the appellant-claimant for arriving at the idle hire charges, both being undisputed, there is no good reason for the Appellate Court to have interfered in the manner it did. [Para 27][629-C-G] 4. The terms and conditions of the contract referred by the respondent-Union of India, namely, Clauses 7, 11, 54 and 70 have been duly noted, discussed and declared as inapplicable to the fact situation by the Sole Arbitrator, by relying on the facts of the case, the conduct of the parties and some other material terms and conditions of the contract, which in his view disentitled the respondent-Union of India from claiming that it was justified in refusing to extend the time as prayed for by the appellant-claimant, to complete the project. Therefore the submission made on behalf of the respondent-Union of India that the Sole Arbitrator had misconducted himself is rejected. Having held so, none of the decisions cited on the aspect of “excepted matters” would be of any assistance to the respondent-Union of India. [Para 29] [630-B-D] ",

[Para 20][626-E-F] 2.2 In the instant case, having gone through the Award, the Sole Arbitrator was lucid in his reasoning for taking a particular view on the interpretation of the terms and conditions of the contract between the parties. It was for this very reason that the Single Judge had forbore from interfering with the arbitral Award and dismissed the petition filed by the respondent-Union of India under Sections 30 and 33 of the 1940 Act. By going into the minute details of the evidence led before the Sole Arbitrator with a magnifying glass and the findings returned thereon, the Appellate Court has clearly transgressed the limitations placed on it. In any case, the reasons offered for taking such a view, are neither justified nor called for for interfering with the arbitral Award. The findings returned by the Sole Arbitrator endorsed by the Single Judge are accepted that there was sufficient justification for the appellant-claimant to have sought extension of time for completing the work and that the decision of the respondent-Union of India to terminate the contract, was not for legitimate reasons. [Paras 21, 22][626-F-H; 627-A-B] 3.1 The second argument concerns the amount that was awarded in favour of the appellant-claimant on account of idle hire charges and the value of its machinery and equipment lying at the site, that has been set aside in the impugned judgment. Though the appellant-claimant had sought compensation under several heads, the Sole Arbitrator granted it an amount of 15,35,40,785/- towards idle hire charges and for the value of the machinery, inclusive of interest upto 31 st May, 1999. The High Court appointed an Engineer to ascertain the availability of the different items and machineries and their value. The Engineer and Insurance Surveyor submitted a report, just after a year from the date of termination of the contract, stating inter alia that therewere 21 items of machinery available at the site and their collective market value was 2,72,95,000/- and that the condition of most of the machineries had deteriorated and they were no longer usable. The High Court allowed the appellant-claimant to remove 21 items of the machinery lying at the site, subject to it furnishing a bank guarantee for a sum of 2.73 crores within three weeks. Though permission was granted to the appellant-claimant to take delivery of the said machineries after furnishing a bank guarantee, it did not do so on taking a plea that when the respondent-Union of India was approached for inspection of the machineries and to verify tampering/missing parts, the latter had refused to prepare any inventory and had stated that the machineries and equipments will be released on a “as is where is basis”. The Sole Arbitrator observed that after termination of the contract of the appellant- claimant, the balance contract work was got completed by the respondent-Union of India through the Border Road Organization [BRO] on 23 rd December, 1995 and till that time, the tools and machinery had remained with the respondent-Union of India. [Paras 23, 24][627-B-C, E-H; 628-A-C] 3.2 Finding fault with the respondent-Union of India of having failed to mitigate the damages by handing back the tools and machineries to the appellant-claimant at least immediately after 23 rd December, 1995, in the arbitral Award held that the appellant-claimant was entitled to idle hire charges from 2 nd April, 1992, the date of termination of the contract, till 23 rd December, 1995, the date of completion of the balance contract work by the BRO. Relying on the report of the Valuer appointed by the Court to give a Report relating to the machineries at the site and their condition and valuation and further, noting that both sides had accepted the said Report, the Sole Arbitrator held that it was fairly considered it safe to rely on the said Report for purposes of assigning valuation to the tools and machinery. Even for purposes of computing the idle hire charges of the machineries for the period between 2 nd April, 1992 to 23 rd December, 1995, the calculation given by the appellant-claimant based on a particular formula, was not objected to by the respondent-Union of India. Premised on the said formula, a sum of 6,77,41,386/- was awarded in favour of the appellant-claimant towards idle hirecharges of machineries and equipment with interest payable @ 18% p.a. and a sum of 2,72,95,000/- was granted to the appellant- claimant towards the value of the tools and machineries totalling to a sum of 15,35,40,785/- inclusive of interest. [Para 25] [628-D-H] A 3.3 The Appellate Court has set aside the aforesaid claim by taking a view that the Sole Arbitrator lost sight of the fact that once the High Court had passed an order granting permission to the appellant-claimant to remove the equipment and machineries from the site in the proceedings initiated by it and still they were not removed, then it has none else to blame but itself for the situation. Holding that the Sole Arbitrator had misconducted himself by observing that the claimant “may be correct” in not taking the machineries without an inventory when they were available at the site, the Appellate Court held that the appellant- claimant was not entitled to any amount towards the value of the tools and machineries, having been awarded idle hire charges for the very same equipments. [Para 26][629-A-C] B 3.4 The aforesaid conclusion drawn by the Appellate Court is manifestly erroneous and flies in the face of the settled legal position that the Arbitrator is the final arbiter of the disputes between the parties and it is not open to a party to challenge the Award on the ground that he has drawn his own conclusions or has failed to appreciate certain facts. It is beyond the jurisdiction of the Appellate Court to assign to itself, the task of construing the terms and conditions of the contract and its provisions and take a view on certain amounts awarded in favour of a party. The Sole Arbitrator had given certain cogent reasons for awarding the amount in favour of the appellant-claimant towards idle hire charges of the parts of the machineries and equipments and loss of machinery. It was beyond the domain of the Appellate Court to have examined the reasonableness of the said reasons by reappreciating the evidence to arrive at a different conclusion. Having regard to the fact that amounts have been awarded in favour of the appellant-claimant on the above heads, based on the Report submitted to the Court by the Court Commissioner for valuing the tools and machinery and premised on the formula offered by the appellant-claimant for arriving at the idle hire charges, both being undisputed, there is no good reason for the Appellate Court to have interfered in the manner it did. [Para 27][629-C-G] 4. The terms and conditions of the contract referred by the respondent-Union of India, namely, Clauses 7, 11, 54 and 70 have been duly noted, discussed and declared as inapplicable to the fact situation by the Sole Arbitrator, by relying on the facts of the case, the conduct of the parties and some other material terms and conditions of the contract, which in his view disentitled the respondent-Union of India from claiming that it was justified in refusing to extend the time as prayed for by the appellant-claimant, to complete the project. Therefore the submission made on behalf of the respondent-Union of India that the Sole Arbitrator had misconducted himself is rejected. Having held so, none of the decisions cited on the aspect of “excepted matters” would be of any assistance to the respondent-Union of India. [Para 29] [630-B-D] ",

Premised on the said formula, a sum of 6,77,41,386/- was awarded in favour of the appellant-claimant towards idle hirecharges of machineries and equipment with interest payable @ 18% p.a. and a sum of 2,72,95,000/- was granted to the appellant- claimant towards the value of the tools and machineries totalling to a sum of 15,35,40,785/- inclusive of interest. [Para 25] [628-D-H] A 3.3 The Appellate Court has set aside the aforesaid claim by taking a view that the Sole Arbitrator lost sight of the fact that once the High Court had passed an order granting permission to the appellant-claimant to remove the equipment and machineries from the site in the proceedings initiated by it and still they were not removed, then it has none else to blame but itself for the situation. Holding that the Sole Arbitrator had misconducted himself by observing that the claimant “may be correct” in not taking the machineries without an inventory when they were available at the site, the Appellate Court held that the appellant- claimant was not entitled to any amount towards the value of the tools and machineries, having been awarded idle hire charges for the very same equipments. [Para 26][629-A-C] B 3.4 The aforesaid conclusion drawn by the Appellate Court is manifestly erroneous and flies in the face of the settled legal position that the Arbitrator is the final arbiter of the disputes between the parties and it is not open to a party to challenge the Award on the ground that he has drawn his own conclusions or has failed to appreciate certain facts. It is beyond the jurisdiction of the Appellate Court to assign to itself, the task of construing the terms and conditions of the contract and its provisions and take a view on certain amounts awarded in favour of a party. The Sole Arbitrator had given certain cogent reasons for awarding the amount in favour of the appellant-claimant towards idle hire charges of the parts of the machineries and equipments and loss of machinery. It was beyond the domain of the Appellate Court to have examined the reasonableness of the said reasons by reappreciating the evidence to arrive at a different conclusion. Having regard to the fact that amounts have been awarded in favour of the appellant-claimant on the above heads, based on the Report submitted to the Court by the Court Commissioner for valuing the tools and machinery and premised on the formula offered by the appellant-claimant for arriving at the idle hire charges, both being undisputed, there is no good reason for the Appellate Court to have interfered in the manner it did. [Para 27][629-C-G] 4. The terms and conditions of the contract referred by the respondent-Union of India, namely, Clauses 7, 11, 54 and 70 have been duly noted, discussed and declared as inapplicable to the fact situation by the Sole Arbitrator, by relying on the facts of the case, the conduct of the parties and some other material terms and conditions of the contract, which in his view disentitled the respondent-Union of India from claiming that it was justified in refusing to extend the time as prayed for by the appellant-claimant, to complete the project. Therefore the submission made on behalf of the respondent-Union of India that the Sole Arbitrator had misconducted himself is rejected. Having held so, none of the decisions cited on the aspect of “excepted matters” would be of any assistance to the respondent-Union of India. [Para 29] [630-B-D] ",

The Sole Arbitrator observed that after termination of the contract of the appellant- claimant, the balance contract work was got completed by the respondent-Union of India through the Border Road Organization [BRO] on 23 rd December, 1995 and till that time, the tools and machinery had remained with the respondent-Union of India.

Arbitration: Arbitrator is the final arbiter of the disputes between the parties and it is not open to a party to challenge the Award on the ground that he has drawn his own conclusions or has failed to appreciate certain facts – It is beyond the jurisdiction of the Appellate Court to assign to itself, the task of construing the terms and conditions of the contract and its provisions and take a view on certain amounts awarded in favour of a party – As long as the Arbitrator has taken a possible view, which may be a plausible view, simply because a different view from that taken in the Award, is possible based on the same evidence, would also not be a ground to interfere in the Award – In the instant case, the Sole Arbitrator had given certain cogent reasons for awarding the amount in favour of the appellant-claimant towards idle hire charges of the parts of the machineries and equipments and loss of machinery – It was beyond the domain of the Appellate Court to have examined the reasonableness of the said reasons by reappreciating the evidence to arrive at a different conclusion – Having regard to the fact that amounts have been awarded in favour of the appellant-claimant on the above heads, based on the Report submitted to the Court by the Court Commissioner for valuing the tools and machinery andpremised on the formula offered by the appellant-claimant for arriving at the idle hire charges, both being undisputed, there is no good reason for the Appellate Court to have interfered in the manner it did – Arbitration Act, 1940. Disposing the appeal, the CourtHELD: 1.1 Court does not sit in appeal over an Award passed by an Arbitrator and the only grounds on which it can be challenged are those that have been specified in Sections 30 and 33 of the Arbitration Act, namely, when there is an error on the face of the Award or when the Arbitrator has mis-conducted himself or the proceedings. [Para 10][619-F-G; 620-A] NTPC Ltd. v. Deconar Services Pvt. Ltd. (2021) SCC Online SC 498 Food Corporation of India v. Sreekanth Transport (1999) 4 SCC 491 : [1999] 3 SCR 699; Kwality Manufacturing Corporation v. Central Warehousing Corporation (2009) 5 SCC 142; Assam State Electricity Board and Others v. Buildworth Private Limited (2017) 8 SCC 146 : [2017] 7 SCR 123– referred to. 1.2 It is also a well-settled principle of law that challenge cannot be laid to the Award only on the ground that the Arbitrator has drawn his own conclusion or failed to appreciate the relevant facts. Nor can the Court substitute its own view on the conclusion of law or facts as against those drawn by the Arbitrator, as if it is sitting in appeal. As long as the Arbitrator has taken a possible view, which may be a plausible view, simply because a different view from that taken in the Award, is possible based on the same evidence, would also not be a ground to interfere in the Award. [Paras 12, 13][621-B-C; 622-B-C] State of Rajasthan v. Puri Construction Co. Ltd. And Another (1994) 6 SCC 485 : [1994] 3 Suppl. SCR 616; Arosan Enterprises Ltd. v.

Jagan Nath Ashok Kumar and Another (1987) 4 SCC 497 : [1988] 1 SCR 180 – referred t2.1 Once the Sole Arbitrator had interpreted the clauses of the contract by taking a particular view and had gone to great length to analyse several reasons offered by the appellant-claimant to justify its plea that it was entitled for extension of time to execute the contract, the Division Bench of the High Court ought not to have sat over the said decision as an Appellate Court and seek to substitute its view for that of the Arbitrator. [Para 20][626-E-F] 2.2 In the instant case, having gone through the Award, the Sole Arbitrator was lucid in his reasoning for taking a particular view on the interpretation of the terms and conditions of the contract between the parties. It was for this very reason that the Single Judge had forbore from interfering with the arbitral Award and dismissed the petition filed by the respondent-Union of India under Sections 30 and 33 of the 1940 Act. By going into the minute details of the evidence led before the Sole Arbitrator with a magnifying glass and the findings returned thereon, the Appellate Court has clearly transgressed the limitations placed on it. In any case, the reasons offered for taking such a view, are neither justified nor called for for interfering with the arbitral Award. The findings returned by the Sole Arbitrator endorsed by the Single Judge are accepted that there was sufficient justification for the appellant-claimant to have sought extension of time for completing the work and that the decision of the respondent-Union of India to terminate the contract, was not for legitimate reasons. [Paras 21, 22][626-F-H; 627-A-B] 3.1 The second argument concerns the amount that was awarded in favour of the appellant-claimant on account of idle hire charges and the value of its machinery and equipment lying at the site, that has been set aside in the impugned judgment. Though the appellant-claimant had sought compensation under several heads, the Sole Arbitrator granted it an amount of 15,35,40,785/- towards idle hire charges and for the value of the machinery, inclusive of interest upto 31 st May, 1999. The High Court appointed an Engineer to ascertain the availability of the different items and machineries and their value. The Engineer and Insurance Surveyor submitted a report, just after a year from the date of termination of the contract, stating inter alia that therewere 21 items of machinery available at the site and their collective market value was 2,72,95,000/- and that the condition of most of the machineries had deteriorated and they were no longer usable. The High Court allowed the appellant-claimant to remove 21 items of the machinery lying at the site, subject to it furnishing a bank guarantee for a sum of 2.73 crores within three weeks. Though permission was granted to the appellant-claimant to take delivery of the said machineries after furnishing a bank guarantee, it did not do so on taking a plea that when the respondent-Union of India was approached for inspection of the machineries and to verify tampering/missing parts, the latter had refused to prepare any inventory and had stated that the machineries and equipments will be released on a “as is where is basis”. The Sole Arbitrator observed that after termination of the contract of the appellant- claimant, the balance contract work was got completed by the respondent-Union of India through the Border Road Organization [BRO] on 23 rd December, 1995 and till that time, the tools and machinery had remained with the respondent-Union of India. [Paras 23, 24][627-B-C, E-H; 628-A-C] 3.2 Finding fault with the respondent-Union of India of having failed to mitigate the damages by handing back the tools and machineries to the appellant-claimant at least immediately after 23 rd December, 1995, in the arbitral Award held that the appellant-claimant was entitled to idle hire charges from 2 nd April, 1992, the date of termination of the contract, till 23 rd December, 1995, the date of completion of the balance contract work by the BRO. Relying on the report of the Valuer appointed by the Court to give a Report relating to the machineries at the site and their condition and valuation and further, noting that both sides had accepted the said Report, the Sole Arbitrator held that it was fairly considered it safe to rely on the said Report for purposes of assigning valuation to the tools and machinery. Even for purposes of computing the idle hire charges of the machineries for the period between 2 nd April, 1992 to 23 rd December, 1995, the calculation given by the appellant-claimant based on a particular formula, was not objected to by the respondent-Union of India. Premised on the said formula, a sum of 6,77,41,386/- was awarded in favour of the appellant-claimant towards idle hirecharges of machineries and equipment with interest payable @ 18% p.a. and a sum of 2,72,95,000/- was granted to the appellant- claimant towards the value of the tools and machineries totalling to a sum of 15,35,40,785/- inclusive of interest. [Para 25] [628-D-H] A 3.3 The Appellate Court has set aside the aforesaid claim by taking a view that the Sole Arbitrator lost sight of the fact that once the High Court had passed an order granting permission to the appellant-claimant to remove the equipment and machineries from the site in the proceedings initiated by it and still they were not removed, then it has none else to blame but itself for the situation. Holding that the Sole Arbitrator had misconducted himself by observing that the claimant “may be correct” in not taking the machineries without an inventory when they were available at the site, the Appellate Court held that the appellant- claimant was not entitled to any amount towards the value of the tools and machineries, having been awarded idle hire charges for the very same equipments. [Para 26][629-A-C] B 3.4 The aforesaid conclusion drawn by the Appellate Court is manifestly erroneous and flies in the face of the settled legal position that the Arbitrator is the final arbiter of the disputes between the parties and it is not open to a party to challenge the Award on the ground that he has drawn his own conclusions or has failed to appreciate certain facts.

The terms and conditions of the contract referred by the respondent-Union of India, namely, Clauses 7, 11, 54 and 70 have been duly noted, discussed and declared as inapplicable to the fact situation by the Sole Arbitrator, by relying on the facts of the case, the conduct of the parties and some other material terms and conditions of the contract, which in his view disentitled the respondent-Union of India from claiming that it was justified in refusing to extend the time as prayed for by the appellant-claimant, to complete the project.

Arbitration: Arbitrator is the final arbiter of the disputes between the parties and it is not open to a party to challenge the Award on the ground that he has drawn his own conclusions or has failed to appreciate certain facts – It is beyond the jurisdiction of the Appellate Court to assign to itself, the task of construing the terms and conditions of the contract and its provisions and take a view on certain amounts awarded in favour of a party – As long as the Arbitrator has taken a possible view, which may be a plausible view, simply because a different view from that taken in the Award, is possible based on the same evidence, would also not be a ground to interfere in the Award – In the instant case, the Sole Arbitrator had given certain cogent reasons for awarding the amount in favour of the appellant-claimant towards idle hire charges of the parts of the machineries and equipments and loss of machinery – It was beyond the domain of the Appellate Court to have examined the reasonableness of the said reasons by reappreciating the evidence to arrive at a different conclusion – Having regard to the fact that amounts have been awarded in favour of the appellant-claimant on the above heads, based on the Report submitted to the Court by the Court Commissioner for valuing the tools and machinery andpremised on the formula offered by the appellant-claimant for arriving at the idle hire charges, both being undisputed, there is no good reason for the Appellate Court to have interfered in the manner it did – Arbitration Act, 1940. Disposing the appeal, the CourtHELD: 1.1 Court does not sit in appeal over an Award passed by an Arbitrator and the only grounds on which it can be challenged are those that have been specified in Sections 30 and 33 of the Arbitration Act, namely, when there is an error on the face of the Award or when the Arbitrator has mis-conducted himself or the proceedings. [Para 10][619-F-G; 620-A] NTPC Ltd. v. Deconar Services Pvt. Ltd. (2021) SCC Online SC 498 Food Corporation of India v. Sreekanth Transport (1999) 4 SCC 491 : [1999] 3 SCR 699; Kwality Manufacturing Corporation v. Central Warehousing Corporation (2009) 5 SCC 142; Assam State Electricity Board and Others v. Buildworth Private Limited (2017) 8 SCC 146 : [2017] 7 SCR 123– referred to. 1.2 It is also a well-settled principle of law that challenge cannot be laid to the Award only on the ground that the Arbitrator has drawn his own conclusion or failed to appreciate the relevant facts. Nor can the Court substitute its own view on the conclusion of law or facts as against those drawn by the Arbitrator, as if it is sitting in appeal. As long as the Arbitrator has taken a possible view, which may be a plausible view, simply because a different view from that taken in the Award, is possible based on the same evidence, would also not be a ground to interfere in the Award. [Paras 12, 13][621-B-C; 622-B-C] State of Rajasthan v. Puri Construction Co. Ltd. And Another (1994) 6 SCC 485 : [1994] 3 Suppl. SCR 616; Arosan Enterprises Ltd. v. Union of India and Another (1999) 9 SCC 449 : [1999] 2 Suppl. SCR 621, Municipal Corporation of Delhi v. Jagan Nath Ashok Kumar and Another (1987) 4 SCC 497 : [1988] 1 SCR 180 – referred t2.1 Once the Sole Arbitrator had interpreted the clauses of the contract by taking a particular view and had gone to great length to analyse several reasons offered by the appellant-claimant to justify its plea that it was entitled for extension of time to execute the contract, the Division Bench of the High Court ought not to have sat over the said decision as an Appellate Court and seek to substitute its view for that of the Arbitrator. [Para 20][626-E-F] 2.2 In the instant case, having gone through the Award, the Sole Arbitrator was lucid in his reasoning for taking a particular view on the interpretation of the terms and conditions of the contract between the parties. It was for this very reason that the Single Judge had forbore from interfering with the arbitral Award and dismissed the petition filed by the respondent-Union of India under Sections 30 and 33 of the 1940 Act. By going into the minute details of the evidence led before the Sole Arbitrator with a magnifying glass and the findings returned thereon, the Appellate Court has clearly transgressed the limitations placed on it. In any case, the reasons offered for taking such a view, are neither justified nor called for for interfering with the arbitral Award. The findings returned by the Sole Arbitrator endorsed by the Single Judge are accepted that there was sufficient justification for the appellant-claimant to have sought extension of time for completing the work and that the decision of the respondent-Union of India to terminate the contract, was not for legitimate reasons. [Paras 21, 22][626-F-H; 627-A-B] 3.1 The second argument concerns the amount that was awarded in favour of the appellant-claimant on account of idle hire charges and the value of its machinery and equipment lying at the site, that has been set aside in the impugned judgment. Though the appellant-claimant had sought compensation under several heads, the Sole Arbitrator granted it an amount of 15,35,40,785/- towards idle hire charges and for the value of the machinery, inclusive of interest upto 31 st May, 1999. The High Court appointed an Engineer to ascertain the availability of the different items and machineries and their value. The Engineer and Insurance Surveyor submitted a report, just after a year from the date of termination of the contract, stating inter alia that therewere 21 items of machinery available at the site and their collective market value was 2,72,95,000/- and that the condition of most of the machineries had deteriorated and they were no longer usable. The High Court allowed the appellant-claimant to remove 21 items of the machinery lying at the site, subject to it furnishing a bank guarantee for a sum of 2.73 crores within three weeks. Though permission was granted to the appellant-claimant to take delivery of the said machineries after furnishing a bank guarantee, it did not do so on taking a plea that when the respondent-Union of India was approached for inspection of the machineries and to verify tampering/missing parts, the latter had refused to prepare any inventory and had stated that the machineries and equipments will be released on a “as is where is basis”. The Sole Arbitrator observed that after termination of the contract of the appellant- claimant, the balance contract work was got completed by the respondent-Union of India through the Border Road Organization [BRO] on 23 rd December, 1995 and till that time, the tools and machinery had remained with the respondent-Union of India. [Paras 23, 24][627-B-C, E-H; 628-A-C] 3.2 Finding fault with the respondent-Union of India of having failed to mitigate the damages by handing back the tools and machineries to the appellant-claimant at least immediately after 23 rd December, 1995, in the arbitral Award held that the appellant-claimant was entitled to idle hire charges from 2 nd April, 1992, the date of termination of the contract, till 23 rd December, 1995, the date of completion of the balance contract work by the BRO. Relying on the report of the Valuer appointed by the Court to give a Report relating to the machineries at the site and their condition and valuation and further, noting that both sides had accepted the said Report, the Sole Arbitrator held that it was fairly considered it safe to rely on the said Report for purposes of assigning valuation to the tools and machinery. Even for purposes of computing the idle hire charges of the machineries for the period between 2 nd April, 1992 to 23 rd December, 1995, the calculation given by the appellant-claimant based on a particular formula, was not objected to by the respondent-Union of India. Premised on the said formula, a sum of 6,77,41,386/- was awarded in favour of the appellant-claimant towards idle hirecharges of machineries and equipment with interest payable @ 18% p.a. and a sum of 2,72,95,000/- was granted to the appellant- claimant towards the value of the tools and machineries totalling to a sum of 15,35,40,785/- inclusive of interest. [Para 25] [628-D-H] A 3.3 The Appellate Court has set aside the aforesaid claim by taking a view that the Sole Arbitrator lost sight of the fact that once the High Court had passed an order granting permission to the appellant-claimant to remove the equipment and machineries from the site in the proceedings initiated by it and still they were not removed, then it has none else to blame but itself for the situation. Holding that the Sole Arbitrator had misconducted himself by observing that the claimant “may be correct” in not taking the machineries without an inventory when they were available at the site, the Appellate Court held that the appellant- claimant was not entitled to any amount towards the value of the tools and machineries, having been awarded idle hire charges for the very same equipments. [Para 26][629-A-C] B 3.4 The aforesaid conclusion drawn by the Appellate Court is manifestly erroneous and flies in the face of the settled legal position that the Arbitrator is the final arbiter of the disputes between the parties and it is not open to a party to challenge the Award on the ground that he has drawn his own conclusions or has failed to appreciate certain facts. It is beyond the jurisdiction of the Appellate Court to assign to itself, the task of construing the terms and conditions of the contract and its provisions and take a view on certain amounts awarded in favour of a party. The Sole Arbitrator had given certain cogent reasons for awarding the amount in favour of the appellant-claimant towards idle hire charges of the parts of the machineries and equipments and loss of machinery. It was beyond the domain of the Appellate Court to have examined the reasonableness of the said reasons by reappreciating the evidence to arrive at a different conclusion. Having regard to the fact that amounts have been awarded in favour of the appellant-claimant on the above heads, based on the Report submitted to the Court by the Court Commissioner for valuing the tools and machinery and premised on the formula offered by the appellant-claimant for arriving at the idle hire charges, both being undisputed, there is no good reason for the Appellate Court to have interfered in the manner it did. [Para 27][629-C-G] 4. The terms and conditions of the contract referred by the respondent-Union of India, namely, Clauses 7, 11, 54 and 70 have been duly noted, discussed and declared as inapplicable to the fact situation by the Sole Arbitrator, by relying on the facts of the case, the conduct of the parties and some other material terms and conditions of the contract, which in his view disentitled the respondent-Union of India from claiming that it was justified in refusing to extend the time as prayed for by the appellant-claimant, to complete the project. Therefore the submission made on behalf of the respondent-Union of India that the Sole Arbitrator had misconducted himself is rejected. Having held so, none of the decisions cited on the aspect of “excepted matters” would be of any assistance to the respondent-Union of India. [Para 29] [630-B-D] ",

[Para 20][626-E-F] 2.2 In the instant case, having gone through the Award, the Sole Arbitrator was lucid in his reasoning for taking a particular view on the interpretation of the terms and conditions of the contract between the parties. It was for this very reason that the Single Judge had forbore from interfering with the arbitral Award and dismissed the petition filed by the respondent-Union of India under Sections 30 and 33 of the 1940 Act. By going into the minute details of the evidence led before the Sole Arbitrator with a magnifying glass and the findings returned thereon, the Appellate Court has clearly transgressed the limitations placed on it. In any case, the reasons offered for taking such a view, are neither justified nor called for for interfering with the arbitral Award. The findings returned by the Sole Arbitrator endorsed by the Single Judge are accepted that there was sufficient justification for the appellant-claimant to have sought extension of time for completing the work and that the decision of the respondent-Union of India to terminate the contract, was not for legitimate reasons. [Paras 21, 22][626-F-H; 627-A-B] 3.1 The second argument concerns the amount that was awarded in favour of the appellant-claimant on account of idle hire charges and the value of its machinery and equipment lying at the site, that has been set aside in the impugned judgment. Though the appellant-claimant had sought compensation under several heads, the Sole Arbitrator granted it an amount of 15,35,40,785/- towards idle hire charges and for the value of the machinery, inclusive of interest upto 31 st May, 1999. The High Court appointed an Engineer to ascertain the availability of the different items and machineries and their value. The Engineer and Insurance Surveyor submitted a report, just after a year from the date of termination of the contract, stating inter alia that therewere 21 items of machinery available at the site and their collective market value was 2,72,95,000/- and that the condition of most of the machineries had deteriorated and they were no longer usable. The High Court allowed the appellant-claimant to remove 21 items of the machinery lying at the site, subject to it furnishing a bank guarantee for a sum of 2.73 crores within three weeks. Though permission was granted to the appellant-claimant to take delivery of the said machineries after furnishing a bank guarantee, it did not do so on taking a plea that when the respondent-Union of India was approached for inspection of the machineries and to verify tampering/missing parts, the latter had refused to prepare any inventory and had stated that the machineries and equipments will be released on a “as is where is basis”. The Sole Arbitrator observed that after termination of the contract of the appellant- claimant, the balance contract work was got completed by the respondent-Union of India through the Border Road Organization [BRO] on 23 rd December, 1995 and till that time, the tools and machinery had remained with the respondent-Union of India. [Paras 23, 24][627-B-C, E-H; 628-A-C] 3.2 Finding fault with the respondent-Union of India of having failed to mitigate the damages by handing back the tools and machineries to the appellant-claimant at least immediately after 23 rd December, 1995, in the arbitral Award held that the appellant-claimant was entitled to idle hire charges from 2 nd April, 1992, the date of termination of the contract, till 23 rd December, 1995, the date of completion of the balance contract work by the BRO. Relying on the report of the Valuer appointed by the Court to give a Report relating to the machineries at the site and their condition and valuation and further, noting that both sides had accepted the said Report, the Sole Arbitrator held that it was fairly considered it safe to rely on the said Report for purposes of assigning valuation to the tools and machinery. Even for purposes of computing the idle hire charges of the machineries for the period between 2 nd April, 1992 to 23 rd December, 1995, the calculation given by the appellant-claimant based on a particular formula, was not objected to by the respondent-Union of India. Premised on the said formula, a sum of 6,77,41,386/- was awarded in favour of the appellant-claimant towards idle hirecharges of machineries and equipment with interest payable @ 18% p.a. and a sum of 2,72,95,000/- was granted to the appellant- claimant towards the value of the tools and machineries totalling to a sum of 15,35,40,785/- inclusive of interest. [Para 25] [628-D-H] A 3.3 The Appellate Court has set aside the aforesaid claim by taking a view that the Sole Arbitrator lost sight of the fact that once the High Court had passed an order granting permission to the appellant-claimant to remove the equipment and machineries from the site in the proceedings initiated by it and still they were not removed, then it has none else to blame but itself for the situation. Holding that the Sole Arbitrator had misconducted himself by observing that the claimant “may be correct” in not taking the machineries without an inventory when they were available at the site, the Appellate Court held that the appellant- claimant was not entitled to any amount towards the value of the tools and machineries, having been awarded idle hire charges for the very same equipments. [Para 26][629-A-C] B 3.4 The aforesaid conclusion drawn by the Appellate Court is manifestly erroneous and flies in the face of the settled legal position that the Arbitrator is the final arbiter of the disputes between the parties and it is not open to a party to challenge the Award on the ground that he has drawn his own conclusions or has failed to appreciate certain facts. It is beyond the jurisdiction of the Appellate Court to assign to itself, the task of construing the terms and conditions of the contract and its provisions and take a view on certain amounts awarded in favour of a party. The Sole Arbitrator had given certain cogent reasons for awarding the amount in favour of the appellant-claimant towards idle hire charges of the parts of the machineries and equipments and loss of machinery. It was beyond the domain of the Appellate Court to have examined the reasonableness of the said reasons by reappreciating the evidence to arrive at a different conclusion. Having regard to the fact that amounts have been awarded in favour of the appellant-claimant on the above heads, based on the Report submitted to the Court by the Court Commissioner for valuing the tools and machinery and premised on the formula offered by the appellant-claimant for arriving at the idle hire charges, both being undisputed, there is no good reason for the Appellate Court to have interfered in the manner it did. [Para 27][629-C-G] 4. The terms and conditions of the contract referred by the respondent-Union of India, namely, Clauses 7, 11, 54 and 70 have been duly noted, discussed and declared as inapplicable to the fact situation by the Sole Arbitrator, by relying on the facts of the case, the conduct of the parties and some other material terms and conditions of the contract, which in his view disentitled the respondent-Union of India from claiming that it was justified in refusing to extend the time as prayed for by the appellant-claimant, to complete the project. Therefore the submission made on behalf of the respondent-Union of India that the Sole Arbitrator had misconducted himself is rejected. Having held so, none of the decisions cited on the aspect of “excepted matters” would be of any assistance to the respondent-Union of India. [Para 29] [630-B-D] ",

The Engineer and Insurance Surveyor submitted a report, just after a year from the date of termination of the contract, stating inter alia that therewere 21 items of machinery available at the site and their collective market value was 2,72,95,000/- and that the condition of most of the machineries had deteriorated and they were no longer usable. The High Court allowed the appellant-claimant to remove 21 items of the machinery lying at the site, subject to it furnishing a bank guarantee for a sum of 2.73 crores within three weeks. Though permission was granted to the appellant-claimant to take delivery of the said machineries after furnishing a bank guarantee, it did not do so on taking a plea that when the respondent-Union of India was approached for inspection of the machineries and to verify tampering/missing parts, the latter had refused to prepare any inventory and had stated that the machineries and equipments will be released on a “as is where is basis”. The Sole Arbitrator observed that after termination of the contract of the appellant- claimant, the balance contract work was got completed by the respondent-Union of India through the Border Road Organization [BRO] on 23 rd December, 1995 and till that time, the tools and machinery had remained with the respondent-Union of India. [Paras 23, 24][627-B-C, E-H; 628-A-C] 3.2 Finding fault with the respondent-Union of India of having failed to mitigate the damages by handing back the tools and machineries to the appellant-claimant at least immediately after 23 rd December, 1995, in the arbitral Award held that the appellant-claimant was entitled to idle hire charges from 2 nd April, 1992, the date of termination of the contract, till 23 rd December, 1995, the date of completion of the balance contract work by the BRO. Relying on the report of the Valuer appointed by the Court to give a Report relating to the machineries at the site and their condition and valuation and further, noting that both sides had accepted the said Report, the Sole Arbitrator held that it was fairly considered it safe to rely on the said Report for purposes of assigning valuation to the tools and machinery. Even for purposes of computing the idle hire charges of the machineries for the period between 2 nd April, 1992 to 23 rd December, 1995, the calculation given by the appellant-claimant based on a particular formula, was not objected to by the respondent-Union of India. Premised on the said formula, a sum of 6,77,41,386/- was awarded in favour of the appellant-claimant towards idle hirecharges of machineries and equipment with interest payable @ 18% p.a. and a sum of 2,72,95,000/- was granted to the appellant- claimant towards the value of the tools and machineries totalling to a sum of 15,35,40,785/- inclusive of interest. [Para 25] [628-D-H] A 3.3 The Appellate Court has set aside the aforesaid claim by taking a view that the Sole Arbitrator lost sight of the fact that once the High Court had passed an order granting permission to the appellant-claimant to remove the equipment and machineries from the site in the proceedings initiated by it and still they were not removed, then it has none else to blame but itself for the situation. Holding that the Sole Arbitrator had misconducted himself by observing that the claimant “may be correct” in not taking the machineries without an inventory when they were available at the site, the Appellate Court held that the appellant- claimant was not entitled to any amount towards the value of the tools and machineries, having been awarded idle hire charges for the very same equipments. [Para 26][629-A-C] B 3.4 The aforesaid conclusion drawn by the Appellate Court is manifestly erroneous and flies in the face of the settled legal position that the Arbitrator is the final arbiter of the disputes between the parties and it is not open to a party to challenge the Award on the ground that he has drawn his own conclusions or has failed to appreciate certain facts. It is beyond the jurisdiction of the Appellate Court to assign to itself, the task of construing the terms and conditions of the contract and its provisions and take a view on certain amounts awarded in favour of a party. The Sole Arbitrator had given certain cogent reasons for awarding the amount in favour of the appellant-claimant towards idle hire charges of the parts of the machineries and equipments and loss of machinery. It was beyond the domain of the Appellate Court to have examined the reasonableness of the said reasons by reappreciating the evidence to arrive at a different conclusion. Having regard to the fact that amounts have been awarded in favour of the appellant-claimant on the above heads, based on the Report submitted to the Court by the Court Commissioner for valuing the tools and machinery and premised on the formula offered by the appellant-claimant for arriving at the idle hire charges, both being undisputed, there is no good reason for the Appellate Court to have interfered in the manner it did. [Para 27][629-C-G] 4. The terms and conditions of the contract referred by the respondent-Union of India, namely, Clauses 7, 11, 54 and 70 have been duly noted, discussed and declared as inapplicable to the fact situation by the Sole Arbitrator, by relying on the facts of the case, the conduct of the parties and some other material terms and conditions of the contract, which in his view disentitled the respondent-Union of India from claiming that it was justified in refusing to extend the time as prayed for by the appellant-claimant, to complete the project. Therefore the submission made on behalf of the respondent-Union of India that the Sole Arbitrator had misconducted himself is rejected. Having held so, none of the decisions cited on the aspect of “excepted matters” would be of any assistance to the respondent-Union of India. [Para 29] [630-B-D] ",
