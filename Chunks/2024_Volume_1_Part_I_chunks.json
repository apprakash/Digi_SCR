        "HeadNote": " Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 – s.30(2)(b)(ii) – Interpretation: Held: s.30(2)(b)(ii) forfends the dissenting financial creditor from settling for a lower amount payable under the resolution plan – A financial creditor can dissent if the resolution plan is discriminatory or against a provision of law– However, a dissenting financial creditor cannot take advantage of s.30(2)(b)(ii) – A secured creditor cannot claim preference over another secured creditor at the stage of distribution on the ground of a dissent or assent, otherwise the distribution would be arbitrary and discriminative – Purpose of the amendment was only to ensure that a dissenting financial creditor does not get anything less than the liquidation value, but not for getting the maximum of the secured assets – There is a contradiction in the reasoning given in the judgment of this Court in India Resurgence ARC Private Limited v. Amit Metaliks Limited & Another [2021] 6 SCR 611, which is in discord with the ratio decidendi of the decisions of the three Judge Bench in Committee of Creditors of Essar Steel India Limited v.

Conviction and sentence of the appellant u/ss.302 and 201, Penal Code, 1860, if justified. Evidence Act, 1872 – s.27 – “in the custody of a police officer” – Interpretation – Case based on circumstantial evidence – Appellant was taken into custody during the course of investigation for the murder of his Uncle – However, he made a disclosure statement – Appellant along with other co-accused had murdered his uncle’s son-deceased (appellant’s cousin) who was missing for months and his body was first dumped in the sump tank and later retrieved, cut into two parts, put in sack bags, and thrown in the river/canal – Appellant subsequently arrested in the present case – On the basis of the disclosure statement, parts of the dead body and sack bags were recovered – Other articles were also recovered – Appellant’s conviction and sentence u/ss.302 and 201, Penal Code, 1860, challenged: Held: The pre-requisite of police custody, within the meaning of s.27, ought to be read pragmatically and not formalistically or euphemistically – “custody” u/s.27 does not mean formal custody – It includes any kind of restriction, restraint or even surveillance by the police– Even if the accused was not formally arrested at the time of giving information, the accused ought to be deemed, for all practical purposes, in the custody of the police – Words “person accused of an offence” and “in the custody of a police officer” in s.27 are separated by a comma and thus, have to be read distinctively – The wide and pragmatic interpretation of the term “police custody” is supported by the fact that if a narrow or technical view is taken, it will be very easy for the police to delay the time of filing the FIR and arrest, and thereby evade the contours of ss.25 to 27 – A person giving word of mouth information to police, which may be used as evidence against him, may be deemed to have submitted himself to the “custody” of the police officer – In the present case, the disclosure statement was made by the appellant when he was detained in another case relating to the murder of his Uncle– He was subsequently arrested in the present case – Body parts of the deceased were recovered on the pointing out of appellant in his disclosure statement – Deceased had been missing for months and was untraceable – His whereabouts were unknown– The perpetrator(s) were also unknown – It is only consequent to the disclosure statement by the appellant that the police came to know that the Deceased had been murdered – The homicidal death of Deceased, the disclosure statement and the consequent recoveries of the motorcycle and other belongings at the behest of the appellant proved beyond doubt – These facts, in the absence of any other material to doubt them, establish that the appellant committed murder of Deceased – The presence of motive, inter se family property disputes, reinforces the said conclusion – Conviction of the appellant upheld. [Paras 25, 28, 29, 31, 41] Evidence Act, 1872 – ss.25-27 – s.27, an exception to ss.25, 26 – Doctrine of confirmation by subsequent events: Held: s.27 is an exception to ss.25 and 26 – s.27 makes that part of the statement which distinctly leads to discovery of a fact in consequence of the information received from a person accused of an offence, to the extent it distinctly relates to the fact thereby discovered, admissible in evidence against the accused – The fact which is discovered as a consequence of the information given is admissible in evidence – Further, the fact discovered must lead to recovery of a physical object and only that information which distinctly relates to that discovery can be proved – s.27 is based on the doctrine of confirmation by subsequent events- a fact is actually discovered in consequence of the information given, which results in recovery of a physical object – The facts discovered and the recovery is an assurance that the information given by a person accused of the offence can be relied – However, s.27 does not lay down the principle that discovery of a fact is to be equated to the object produced or found. [Paras 19, 22]  Evidence Act, 1872 – s.27 – Conditions necessary for bringing s.27 into operation, discussed – Facts proved by the prosecution – Duty of the Court – Evidence produced in terms of s.27 – Evidentiary value: Held: The facts proved by the prosecution, particularly the admissible portion of the statement of the accused, would give rise to two alternative hypotheses, (i) that the accused had himself deposited the physical items which were recovered; or (ii) only the accused knew that the physical items were lying at that place – The second hypothesis is wholly compatible with the innocence of the accused, whereas the first would be a factor to show involvement of the accused in the offence – The court has to analyse which of the hypotheses should be accepted in a particular case – s.27 is frequently used by the police, and the courts must be vigilant about its application to ensure credibility of evidence, as the provision is vulnerable to abuse – However, this does not mean that in every case invocation of s.27 must be seen with suspicion and is to be discarded as perfunctory and unworthy of credence – Evidentiary value to be attached on evidence produced before the court in terms of s.27 cannot be codified or put in a straightjacket formula – It depends upon the facts and circumstances of the case – A holistic and inferential appreciation of evidence is required to be adopted in a case of circumstantial evidence. [Paras 23, 24] Evidence Act, 1872– ss.24-27 – “accused person”, “a person accused of any offence”: Held: The bar u/s.25 applies equally whether or not the person against whom evidence is sought to be led in a criminal trial was in custody at the time of making the confession – For the ban to be effective the person need not have been accused of an offence when he made the confession – The reason is that the expression “accused person” in s.24 and the expression “a person accused of any offence” in ss.26 and 27 have the same connotation, and describe the person against whom evidence is sought to be led in a criminal proceeding – The adjectival clause “accused of any offence” is, therefore, descriptive of the person against whom a confessional statement made by him is declared not provable, and does not predicate a condition of that person at the time of making the statement. [Para 26] Criminal Law – Appellant was accused of the murder of his Uncle and his son – Acquitted in the case relating to the murder of Uncle – Judgment of acquittal – Evidentiary value, if any: Held: Except for the fact that the appellant was taken into custody during the course of investigation for the murder of his Uncle and thereupon his disclosure statement (Exhibit P-37) was recorded, there is no connection between the two offences – Murders were committed on two different dates – Murder trial of his Uncle was primarily based upon an entirely different set of evidence – Conviction of the appellant is sustainable in view of the evidence placed on record in the present case – The judgment of acquittal would not qualify as relevant and of evidentiary value so as to acquit the appellant in the present case. [Para 42] Evidence Act, 1872 – s.27 – Disclosure statement (Exhibit P-37) made by the appellant, convicted – Acquittal of the coaccused – Application of s.27: Held: Acquittal of the co-accused was for want of evidence against them – At best, they were found in possession of the articles connected with the crime on the basis of the disclosure statement (Exhibit P-37) made by the appellant – s.27 of the Evidence Act could not have been applied to the other co-accused as the provision pertains to information that distinctly relates to the discovery of a ‘fact’ that was previously unknown, as opposed to fact already disclosed or known – Once information is given by an accused, the same information cannot be used, even if voluntarily made by a co-accused who is in custody – s.27 does apply to joint disclosures, but this is not one such case – This was precisely the reason given by the trial court to acquit the co-accused – Further, even if Section 8 of the Evidence Act was to apply, it would not have been possible to convict the co-accused – The trial court rightly held other co-accused not guilty. [Para 43] Evidence – Case based on circumstantial evidence – Five golden principles to be satisfied as laid down in Sharad Birdhichand Sarda v. State of Maharashtra [1985] 1 SCR 88 – Conditions to be fulfilled before the false explanation or a false defence can be used by the Court as an additional link to lend an assurance to the court, stated – A distinction has to be drawn between incomplete chain of circumstances and a circumstance after a chain is complete and the defence or explanation given by the accused is found to be false, in which event the said falsehood is added to reinforce the conclusion of the court. [Paras 37, 38] Evidence Act, 1872 – s.106 – Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 – s.313: Held: Appellant in his statement u/s.313 denied all accusations without furnishing any explanation regarding his knowledge of the places from which the dead body was recovered – The failure of the appellant to present evidence on his behalf or to offer any cogent explanation regarding the recovery of the dead body by virtue of his special knowledge must lead to a reasonable adverse inference, by application of the principle u/s.106 of the Evidence Act thus forming an additional link in the chain of circumstances – The additional link further affirms the conclusion of guilt as indicated by the prosecution evidence. [Para 40] Words and Phrases – ‘distinctly’ in s.27, Evidence Act, 1872: Held: The word ‘distinctly’ is used to limit and define the scope of the information and means ‘directly’, ‘indubitably’, ‘strictly’ or ‘unmistakably’ – Only that part of the information which is clear, immediate and a proximate cause of discovery is admissible.

Conviction and sentence of the appellant u/ss.302 and 201, Penal Code, 1860, if justified. Evidence Act, 1872 – s.27 – “in the custody of a police officer” – Interpretation – Case based on circumstantial evidence – Appellant was taken into custody during the course of investigation for the murder of his Uncle – However, he made a disclosure statement – Appellant along with other co-accused had murdered his uncle’s son-deceased (appellant’s cousin) who was missing for months and his body was first dumped in the sump tank and later retrieved, cut into two parts, put in sack bags, and thrown in the river/canal – Appellant subsequently arrested in the present case – On the basis of the disclosure statement, parts of the dead body and sack bags were recovered – Other articles were also recovered – Appellant’s conviction and sentence u/ss.302 and 201, Penal Code, 1860, challenged: Held: The pre-requisite of police custody, within the meaning of s.27, ought to be read pragmatically and not formalistically or euphemistically – “custody” u/s.27 does not mean formal custody – It includes any kind of restriction, restraint or even surveillance by the police– Even if the accused was not formally arrested at the time of giving information, the accused ought to be deemed, for all practical purposes, in the custody of the police – Words “person accused of an offence” and “in the custody of a police officer” in s.27 are separated by a comma and thus, have to be read distinctively – The wide and pragmatic interpretation of the term “police custody” is supported by the fact that if a narrow or technical view is taken, it will be very easy for the police to delay the time of filing the FIR and arrest, and thereby evade the contours of ss.25 to 27 – A person giving word of mouth information to police, which may be used as evidence against him, may be deemed to have submitted himself to the “custody” of the police officer – In the present case, the disclosure statement was made by the appellant when he was detained in another case relating to the murder of his Uncle– He was subsequently arrested in the present case – Body parts of the deceased were recovered on the pointing out of appellant in his disclosure statement – Deceased had been missing for months and was untraceable – His whereabouts were unknown– The perpetrator(s) were also unknown – It is only consequent to the disclosure statement by the appellant that the police came to know that the Deceased had been murdered – The homicidal death of Deceased, the disclosure statement and the consequent recoveries of the motorcycle and other belongings at the behest of the appellant proved beyond doubt – These facts, in the absence of any other material to doubt them, establish that the appellant committed murder of Deceased – The presence of motive, inter se family property disputes, reinforces the said conclusion – Conviction of the appellant upheld. [Paras 25, 28, 29, 31, 41] Evidence Act, 1872 – ss.25-27 – s.27, an exception to ss.25, 26 – Doctrine of confirmation by subsequent events: Held: s.27 is an exception to ss.25 and 26 – s.27 makes that part of the statement which distinctly leads to discovery of a fact in consequence of the information received from a person accused of an offence, to the extent it distinctly relates to the fact thereby discovered, admissible in evidence against the accused – The fact which is discovered as a consequence of the information given is admissible in evidence – Further, the fact discovered must lead to recovery of a physical object and only that information which distinctly relates to that discovery can be proved – s.27 is based on the doctrine of confirmation by subsequent events- a fact is actually discovered in consequence of the information given, which results in recovery of a physical object – The facts discovered and the recovery is an assurance that the information given by a person accused of the offence can be relied – However, s.27 does not lay down the principle that discovery of a fact is to be equated to the object produced or found. [Paras 19, 22]  Evidence Act, 1872 – s.27 – Conditions necessary for bringing s.27 into operation, discussed – Facts proved by the prosecution – Duty of the Court – Evidence produced in terms of s.27 – Evidentiary value: Held: The facts proved by the prosecution, particularly the admissible portion of the statement of the accused, would give rise to two alternative hypotheses, (i) that the accused had himself deposited the physical items which were recovered; or (ii) only the accused knew that the physical items were lying at that place – The second hypothesis is wholly compatible with the innocence of the accused, whereas the first would be a factor to show involvement of the accused in the offence – The court has to analyse which of the hypotheses should be accepted in a particular case – s.27 is frequently used by the police, and the courts must be vigilant about its application to ensure credibility of evidence, as the provision is vulnerable to abuse – However, this does not mean that in every case invocation of s.27 must be seen with suspicion and is to be discarded as perfunctory and unworthy of credence – Evidentiary value to be attached on evidence produced before the court in terms of s.27 cannot be codified or put in a straightjacket formula – It depends upon the facts and circumstances of the case – A holistic and inferential appreciation of evidence is required to be adopted in a case of circumstantial evidence. [Paras 23, 24] Evidence Act, 1872– ss.24-27 – “accused person”, “a person accused of any offence”: Held: The bar u/s.25 applies equally whether or not the person against whom evidence is sought to be led in a criminal trial was in custody at the time of making the confession – For the ban to be effective the person need not have been accused of an offence when he made the confession – The reason is that the expression “accused person” in s.24 and the expression “a person accused of any offence” in ss.26 and 27 have the same connotation, and describe the person against whom evidence is sought to be led in a criminal proceeding – The adjectival clause “accused of any offence” is, therefore, descriptive of the person against whom a confessional statement made by him is declared not provable, and does not predicate a condition of that person at the time of making the statement. [Para 26] Criminal Law – Appellant was accused of the murder of his Uncle and his son – Acquitted in the case relating to the murder of Uncle – Judgment of acquittal – Evidentiary value, if any: Held: Except for the fact that the appellant was taken into custody during the course of investigation for the murder of his Uncle and thereupon his disclosure statement (Exhibit P-37) was recorded, there is no connection between the two offences – Murders were committed on two different dates – Murder trial of his Uncle was primarily based upon an entirely different set of evidence – Conviction of the appellant is sustainable in view of the evidence placed on record in the present case – The judgment of acquittal would not qualify as relevant and of evidentiary value so as to acquit the appellant in the present case. [Para 42] Evidence Act, 1872 – s.27 – Disclosure statement (Exhibit P-37) made by the appellant, convicted – Acquittal of the coaccused – Application of s.27: Held: Acquittal of the co-accused was for want of evidence against them – At best, they were found in possession of the articles connected with the crime on the basis of the disclosure statement (Exhibit P-37) made by the appellant – s.27 of the Evidence Act could not have been applied to the other co-accused as the provision pertains to information that distinctly relates to the discovery of a ‘fact’ that was previously unknown, as opposed to fact already disclosed or known – Once information is given by an accused, the same information cannot be used, even if voluntarily made by a co-accused who is in custody – s.27 does apply to joint disclosures, but this is not one such case – This was precisely the reason given by the trial court to acquit the co-accused – Further, even if Section 8 of the Evidence Act was to apply, it would not have been possible to convict the co-accused – The trial court rightly held other co-accused not guilty. [Para 43] Evidence – Case based on circumstantial evidence – Five golden principles to be satisfied as laid down in Sharad Birdhichand Sarda v. State of Maharashtra [1985] 1 SCR 88 – Conditions to be fulfilled before the false explanation or a false defence can be used by the Court as an additional link to lend an assurance to the court, stated – A distinction has to be drawn between incomplete chain of circumstances and a circumstance after a chain is complete and the defence or explanation given by the accused is found to be false, in which event the said falsehood is added to reinforce the conclusion of the court. [Paras 37, 38] Evidence Act, 1872 – s.106 – Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 – s.313: Held: Appellant in his statement u/s.313 denied all accusations without furnishing any explanation regarding his knowledge of the places from which the dead body was recovered – The failure of the appellant to present evidence on his behalf or to offer any cogent explanation regarding the recovery of the dead body by virtue of his special knowledge must lead to a reasonable adverse inference, by application of the principle u/s.106 of the Evidence Act thus forming an additional link in the chain of circumstances – The additional link further affirms the conclusion of guilt as indicated by the prosecution evidence. [Para 40] Words and Phrases – ‘distinctly’ in s.27, Evidence Act, 1872: Held: The word ‘distinctly’ is used to limit and define the scope of the information and means ‘directly’, ‘indubitably’, ‘strictly’ or ‘unmistakably’ – Only that part of the information which is clear, immediate and a proximate cause of discovery is admissible.

Conviction and sentence of the appellant u/ss.302 and 201, Penal Code, 1860, if justified. Evidence Act, 1872 – s.27 – “in the custody of a police officer” – Interpretation – Case based on circumstantial evidence – Appellant was taken into custody during the course of investigation for the murder of his Uncle – However, he made a disclosure statement – Appellant along with other co-accused had murdered his uncle’s son-deceased (appellant’s cousin) who was missing for months and his body was first dumped in the sump tank and later retrieved, cut into two parts, put in sack bags, and thrown in the river/canal – Appellant subsequently arrested in the present case – On the basis of the disclosure statement, parts of the dead body and sack bags were recovered – Other articles were also recovered – Appellant’s conviction and sentence u/ss.302 and 201, Penal Code, 1860, challenged: Held: The pre-requisite of police custody, within the meaning of s.27, ought to be read pragmatically and not formalistically or euphemistically – “custody” u/s.27 does not mean formal custody – It includes any kind of restriction, restraint or even surveillance by the police– Even if the accused was not formally arrested at the time of giving information, the accused ought to be deemed, for all practical purposes, in the custody of the police – Words “person accused of an offence” and “in the custody of a police officer” in s.27 are separated by a comma and thus, have to be read distinctively – The wide and pragmatic interpretation of the term “police custody” is supported by the fact that if a narrow or technical view is taken, it will be very easy for the police to delay the time of filing the FIR and arrest, and thereby evade the contours of ss.25 to 27 – A person giving word of mouth information to police, which may be used as evidence against him, may be deemed to have submitted himself to the “custody” of the police officer – In the present case, the disclosure statement was made by the appellant when he was detained in another case relating to the murder of his Uncle– He was subsequently arrested in the present case – Body parts of the deceased were recovered on the pointing out of appellant in his disclosure statement – Deceased had been missing for months and was untraceable – His whereabouts were unknown– The perpetrator(s) were also unknown – It is only consequent to the disclosure statement by the appellant that the police came to know that the Deceased had been murdered – The homicidal death of Deceased, the disclosure statement and the consequent recoveries of the motorcycle and other belongings at the behest of the appellant proved beyond doubt – These facts, in the absence of any other material to doubt them, establish that the appellant committed murder of Deceased – The presence of motive, inter se family property disputes, reinforces the said conclusion – Conviction of the appellant upheld. [Paras 25, 28, 29, 31, 41] Evidence Act, 1872 – ss.25-27 – s.27, an exception to ss.25, 26 – Doctrine of confirmation by subsequent events: Held: s.27 is an exception to ss.25 and 26 – s.27 makes that part of the statement which distinctly leads to discovery of a fact in consequence of the information received from a person accused of an offence, to the extent it distinctly relates to the fact thereby discovered, admissible in evidence against the accused – The fact which is discovered as a consequence of the information given is admissible in evidence – Further, the fact discovered must lead to recovery of a physical object and only that information which distinctly relates to that discovery can be proved – s.27 is based on the doctrine of confirmation by subsequent events- a fact is actually discovered in consequence of the information given, which results in recovery of a physical object – The facts discovered and the recovery is an assurance that the information given by a person accused of the offence can be relied – However, s.27 does not lay down the principle that discovery of a fact is to be equated to the object produced or found. [Paras 19, 22]  Evidence Act, 1872 – s.27 – Conditions necessary for bringing s.27 into operation, discussed – Facts proved by the prosecution – Duty of the Court – Evidence produced in terms of s.27 – Evidentiary value: Held: The facts proved by the prosecution, particularly the admissible portion of the statement of the accused, would give rise to two alternative hypotheses, (i) that the accused had himself deposited the physical items which were recovered; or (ii) only the accused knew that the physical items were lying at that place – The second hypothesis is wholly compatible with the innocence of the accused, whereas the first would be a factor to show involvement of the accused in the offence – The court has to analyse which of the hypotheses should be accepted in a particular case – s.27 is frequently used by the police, and the courts must be vigilant about its application to ensure credibility of evidence, as the provision is vulnerable to abuse – However, this does not mean that in every case invocation of s.27 must be seen with suspicion and is to be discarded as perfunctory and unworthy of credence – Evidentiary value to be attached on evidence produced before the court in terms of s.27 cannot be codified or put in a straightjacket formula – It depends upon the facts and circumstances of the case – A holistic and inferential appreciation of evidence is required to be adopted in a case of circumstantial evidence. [Paras 23, 24] Evidence Act, 1872– ss.24-27 – “accused person”, “a person accused of any offence”: Held: The bar u/s.25 applies equally whether or not the person against whom evidence is sought to be led in a criminal trial was in custody at the time of making the confession – For the ban to be effective the person need not have been accused of an offence when he made the confession – The reason is that the expression “accused person” in s.24 and the expression “a person accused of any offence” in ss.26 and 27 have the same connotation, and describe the person against whom evidence is sought to be led in a criminal proceeding – The adjectival clause “accused of any offence” is, therefore, descriptive of the person against whom a confessional statement made by him is declared not provable, and does not predicate a condition of that person at the time of making the statement. [Para 26] Criminal Law – Appellant was accused of the murder of his Uncle and his son – Acquitted in the case relating to the murder of Uncle – Judgment of acquittal – Evidentiary value, if any: Held: Except for the fact that the appellant was taken into custody during the course of investigation for the murder of his Uncle and thereupon his disclosure statement (Exhibit P-37) was recorded, there is no connection between the two offences – Murders were committed on two different dates – Murder trial of his Uncle was primarily based upon an entirely different set of evidence – Conviction of the appellant is sustainable in view of the evidence placed on record in the present case – The judgment of acquittal would not qualify as relevant and of evidentiary value so as to acquit the appellant in the present case. [Para 42] Evidence Act, 1872 – s.27 – Disclosure statement (Exhibit P-37) made by the appellant, convicted – Acquittal of the coaccused – Application of s.27: Held: Acquittal of the co-accused was for want of evidence against them – At best, they were found in possession of the articles connected with the crime on the basis of the disclosure statement (Exhibit P-37) made by the appellant – s.27 of the Evidence Act could not have been applied to the other co-accused as the provision pertains to information that distinctly relates to the discovery of a ‘fact’ that was previously unknown, as opposed to fact already disclosed or known – Once information is given by an accused, the same information cannot be used, even if voluntarily made by a co-accused who is in custody – s.27 does apply to joint disclosures, but this is not one such case – This was precisely the reason given by the trial court to acquit the co-accused – Further, even if Section 8 of the Evidence Act was to apply, it would not have been possible to convict the co-accused – The trial court rightly held other co-accused not guilty. [Para 43] Evidence – Case based on circumstantial evidence – Five golden principles to be satisfied as laid down in Sharad Birdhichand Sarda v. State of Maharashtra [1985] 1 SCR 88 – Conditions to be fulfilled before the false explanation or a false defence can be used by the Court as an additional link to lend an assurance to the court, stated – A distinction has to be drawn between incomplete chain of circumstances and a circumstance after a chain is complete and the defence or explanation given by the accused is found to be false, in which event the said falsehood is added to reinforce the conclusion of the court. [Paras 37, 38] Evidence Act, 1872 – s.106 – Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 – s.313: Held: Appellant in his statement u/s.313 denied all accusations without furnishing any explanation regarding his knowledge of the places from which the dead body was recovered – The failure of the appellant to present evidence on his behalf or to offer any cogent explanation regarding the recovery of the dead body by virtue of his special knowledge must lead to a reasonable adverse inference, by application of the principle u/s.106 of the Evidence Act thus forming an additional link in the chain of circumstances – The additional link further affirms the conclusion of guilt as indicated by the prosecution evidence. [Para 40] Words and Phrases – ‘distinctly’ in s.27, Evidence Act, 1872: Held: The word ‘distinctly’ is used to limit and define the scope of the information and means ‘directly’, ‘indubitably’, ‘strictly’ or ‘unmistakably’ – Only that part of the information which is clear, immediate and a proximate cause of discovery is admissible.

        "content": "[Para 42] Evidence Act, 1872 – s.27 – Disclosure statement (Exhibit P-37) made by the appellant, convicted – Acquittal of the coaccused – Application of s.27: Held: Acquittal of the co-accused was for want of evidence against them – At best, they were found in possession of the articles connected with the crime on the basis of the disclosure statement (Exhibit P-37) made by the appellant – s.27 of the Evidence Act could not have been applied to the other co-accused as the provision pertains to information that distinctly relates to the discovery of a ‘fact’ that was previously unknown, as opposed to fact already disclosed or known – Once information is given by an accused, the same information cannot be used, even if voluntarily made by a co-accused who is in custody – s.27 does apply to joint disclosures, but this is not one such case – This was precisely the reason given by the trial court to acquit the co-accused – Further, even if Section 8 of the Evidence Act was to apply, it would not have been possible to convict the co-accused – The trial court rightly held other co-accused not guilty."

Conviction and sentence of the appellant u/ss.302 and 201, Penal Code, 1860, if justified. Evidence Act, 1872 – s.27 – “in the custody of a police officer” – Interpretation – Case based on circumstantial evidence – Appellant was taken into custody during the course of investigation for the murder of his Uncle – However, he made a disclosure statement – Appellant along with other co-accused had murdered his uncle’s son-deceased (appellant’s cousin) who was missing for months and his body was first dumped in the sump tank and later retrieved, cut into two parts, put in sack bags, and thrown in the river/canal – Appellant subsequently arrested in the present case – On the basis of the disclosure statement, parts of the dead body and sack bags were recovered – Other articles were also recovered – Appellant’s conviction and sentence u/ss.302 and 201, Penal Code, 1860, challenged: Held: The pre-requisite of police custody, within the meaning of s.27, ought to be read pragmatically and not formalistically or euphemistically – “custody” u/s.27 does not mean formal custody – It includes any kind of restriction, restraint or even surveillance by the police– Even if the accused was not formally arrested at the time of giving information, the accused ought to be deemed, for all practical purposes, in the custody of the police – Words “person accused of an offence” and “in the custody of a police officer” in s.27 are separated by a comma and thus, have to be read distinctively – The wide and pragmatic interpretation of the term “police custody” is supported by the fact that if a narrow or technical view is taken, it will be very easy for the police to delay the time of filing the FIR and arrest, and thereby evade the contours of ss.25 to 27 – A person giving word of mouth information to police, which may be used as evidence against him, may be deemed to have submitted himself to the “custody” of the police officer – In the present case, the disclosure statement was made by the appellant when he was detained in another case relating to the murder of his Uncle– He was subsequently arrested in the present case – Body parts of the deceased were recovered on the pointing out of appellant in his disclosure statement – Deceased had been missing for months and was untraceable – His whereabouts were unknown– The perpetrator(s) were also unknown – It is only consequent to the disclosure statement by the appellant that the police came to know that the Deceased had been murdered – The homicidal death of Deceased, the disclosure statement and the consequent recoveries of the motorcycle and other belongings at the behest of the appellant proved beyond doubt – These facts, in the absence of any other material to doubt them, establish that the appellant committed murder of Deceased – The presence of motive, inter se family property disputes, reinforces the said conclusion – Conviction of the appellant upheld. [Paras 25, 28, 29, 31, 41] Evidence Act, 1872 – ss.25-27 – s.27, an exception to ss.25, 26 – Doctrine of confirmation by subsequent events: Held: s.27 is an exception to ss.25 and 26 – s.27 makes that part of the statement which distinctly leads to discovery of a fact in consequence of the information received from a person accused of an offence, to the extent it distinctly relates to the fact thereby discovered, admissible in evidence against the accused – The fact which is discovered as a consequence of the information given is admissible in evidence – Further, the fact discovered must lead to recovery of a physical object and only that information which distinctly relates to that discovery can be proved – s.27 is based on the doctrine of confirmation by subsequent events- a fact is actually discovered in consequence of the information given, which results in recovery of a physical object – The facts discovered and the recovery is an assurance that the information given by a person accused of the offence can be relied – However, s.27 does not lay down the principle that discovery of a fact is to be equated to the object produced or found. [Paras 19, 22]  Evidence Act, 1872 – s.27 – Conditions necessary for bringing s.27 into operation, discussed – Facts proved by the prosecution – Duty of the Court – Evidence produced in terms of s.27 – Evidentiary value: Held: The facts proved by the prosecution, particularly the admissible portion of the statement of the accused, would give rise to two alternative hypotheses, (i) that the accused had himself deposited the physical items which were recovered; or (ii) only the accused knew that the physical items were lying at that place – The second hypothesis is wholly compatible with the innocence of the accused, whereas the first would be a factor to show involvement of the accused in the offence – The court has to analyse which of the hypotheses should be accepted in a particular case – s.27 is frequently used by the police, and the courts must be vigilant about its application to ensure credibility of evidence, as the provision is vulnerable to abuse – However, this does not mean that in every case invocation of s.27 must be seen with suspicion and is to be discarded as perfunctory and unworthy of credence – Evidentiary value to be attached on evidence produced before the court in terms of s.27 cannot be codified or put in a straightjacket formula – It depends upon the facts and circumstances of the case – A holistic and inferential appreciation of evidence is required to be adopted in a case of circumstantial evidence. [Paras 23, 24] Evidence Act, 1872– ss.24-27 – “accused person”, “a person accused of any offence”: Held: The bar u/s.25 applies equally whether or not the person against whom evidence is sought to be led in a criminal trial was in custody at the time of making the confession – For the ban to be effective the person need not have been accused of an offence when he made the confession – The reason is that the expression “accused person” in s.24 and the expression “a person accused of any offence” in ss.26 and 27 have the same connotation, and describe the person against whom evidence is sought to be led in a criminal proceeding – The adjectival clause “accused of any offence” is, therefore, descriptive of the person against whom a confessional statement made by him is declared not provable, and does not predicate a condition of that person at the time of making the statement. [Para 26] Criminal Law – Appellant was accused of the murder of his Uncle and his son – Acquitted in the case relating to the murder of Uncle – Judgment of acquittal – Evidentiary value, if any: Held: Except for the fact that the appellant was taken into custody during the course of investigation for the murder of his Uncle and thereupon his disclosure statement (Exhibit P-37) was recorded, there is no connection between the two offences – Murders were committed on two different dates – Murder trial of his Uncle was primarily based upon an entirely different set of evidence – Conviction of the appellant is sustainable in view of the evidence placed on record in the present case – The judgment of acquittal would not qualify as relevant and of evidentiary value so as to acquit the appellant in the present case. [Para 42] Evidence Act, 1872 – s.27 – Disclosure statement (Exhibit P-37) made by the appellant, convicted – Acquittal of the coaccused – Application of s.27: Held: Acquittal of the co-accused was for want of evidence against them – At best, they were found in possession of the articles connected with the crime on the basis of the disclosure statement (Exhibit P-37) made by the appellant – s.27 of the Evidence Act could not have been applied to the other co-accused as the provision pertains to information that distinctly relates to the discovery of a ‘fact’ that was previously unknown, as opposed to fact already disclosed or known – Once information is given by an accused, the same information cannot be used, even if voluntarily made by a co-accused who is in custody – s.27 does apply to joint disclosures, but this is not one such case – This was precisely the reason given by the trial court to acquit the co-accused – Further, even if Section 8 of the Evidence Act was to apply, it would not have been possible to convict the co-accused – The trial court rightly held other co-accused not guilty. [Para 43] Evidence – Case based on circumstantial evidence – Five golden principles to be satisfied as laid down in Sharad Birdhichand Sarda v. State of Maharashtra [1985] 1 SCR 88 – Conditions to be fulfilled before the false explanation or a false defence can be used by the Court as an additional link to lend an assurance to the court, stated – A distinction has to be drawn between incomplete chain of circumstances and a circumstance after a chain is complete and the defence or explanation given by the accused is found to be false, in which event the said falsehood is added to reinforce the conclusion of the court. [Paras 37, 38] Evidence Act, 1872 – s.106 – Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 – s.313: Held: Appellant in his statement u/s.313 denied all accusations without furnishing any explanation regarding his knowledge of the places from which the dead body was recovered – The failure of the appellant to present evidence on his behalf or to offer any cogent explanation regarding the recovery of the dead body by virtue of his special knowledge must lead to a reasonable adverse inference, by application of the principle u/s.106 of the Evidence Act thus forming an additional link in the chain of circumstances – The additional link further affirms the conclusion of guilt as indicated by the prosecution evidence. [Para 40] Words and Phrases – ‘distinctly’ in s.27, Evidence Act, 1872: Held: The word ‘distinctly’ is used to limit and define the scope of the information and means ‘directly’, ‘indubitably’, ‘strictly’ or ‘unmistakably’ – Only that part of the information which is clear, immediate and a proximate cause of discovery is admissible.

Conviction and sentence of the appellant u/ss.302 and 201, Penal Code, 1860, if justified. Evidence Act, 1872 – s.27 – “in the custody of a police officer” – Interpretation – Case based on circumstantial evidence – Appellant was taken into custody during the course of investigation for the murder of his Uncle – However, he made a disclosure statement – Appellant along with other co-accused had murdered his uncle’s son-deceased (appellant’s cousin) who was missing for months and his body was first dumped in the sump tank and later retrieved, cut into two parts, put in sack bags, and thrown in the river/canal – Appellant subsequently arrested in the present case – On the basis of the disclosure statement, parts of the dead body and sack bags were recovered – Other articles were also recovered – Appellant’s conviction and sentence u/ss.302 and 201, Penal Code, 1860, challenged: Held: The pre-requisite of police custody, within the meaning of s.27, ought to be read pragmatically and not formalistically or euphemistically – “custody” u/s.27 does not mean formal custody – It includes any kind of restriction, restraint or even surveillance by the police– Even if the accused was not formally arrested at the time of giving information, the accused ought to be deemed, for all practical purposes, in the custody of the police – Words “person accused of an offence” and “in the custody of a police officer” in s.27 are separated by a comma and thus, have to be read distinctively – The wide and pragmatic interpretation of the term “police custody” is supported by the fact that if a narrow or technical view is taken, it will be very easy for the police to delay the time of filing the FIR and arrest, and thereby evade the contours of ss.25 to 27 – A person giving word of mouth information to police, which may be used as evidence against him, may be deemed to have submitted himself to the “custody” of the police officer – In the present case, the disclosure statement was made by the appellant when he was detained in another case relating to the murder of his Uncle– He was subsequently arrested in the present case – Body parts of the deceased were recovered on the pointing out of appellant in his disclosure statement – Deceased had been missing for months and was untraceable – His whereabouts were unknown– The perpetrator(s) were also unknown – It is only consequent to the disclosure statement by the appellant that the police came to know that the Deceased had been murdered – The homicidal death of Deceased, the disclosure statement and the consequent recoveries of the motorcycle and other belongings at the behest of the appellant proved beyond doubt – These facts, in the absence of any other material to doubt them, establish that the appellant committed murder of Deceased – The presence of motive, inter se family property disputes, reinforces the said conclusion – Conviction of the appellant upheld. [Paras 25, 28, 29, 31, 41] Evidence Act, 1872 – ss.25-27 – s.27, an exception to ss.25, 26 – Doctrine of confirmation by subsequent events: Held: s.27 is an exception to ss.25 and 26 – s.27 makes that part of the statement which distinctly leads to discovery of a fact in consequence of the information received from a person accused of an offence, to the extent it distinctly relates to the fact thereby discovered, admissible in evidence against the accused – The fact which is discovered as a consequence of the information given is admissible in evidence – Further, the fact discovered must lead to recovery of a physical object and only that information which distinctly relates to that discovery can be proved – s.27 is based on the doctrine of confirmation by subsequent events- a fact is actually discovered in consequence of the information given, which results in recovery of a physical object – The facts discovered and the recovery is an assurance that the information given by a person accused of the offence can be relied – However, s.27 does not lay down the principle that discovery of a fact is to be equated to the object produced or found. [Paras 19, 22]  Evidence Act, 1872 – s.27 – Conditions necessary for bringing s.27 into operation, discussed – Facts proved by the prosecution – Duty of the Court – Evidence produced in terms of s.27 – Evidentiary value: Held: The facts proved by the prosecution, particularly the admissible portion of the statement of the accused, would give rise to two alternative hypotheses, (i) that the accused had himself deposited the physical items which were recovered; or (ii) only the accused knew that the physical items were lying at that place – The second hypothesis is wholly compatible with the innocence of the accused, whereas the first would be a factor to show involvement of the accused in the offence – The court has to analyse which of the hypotheses should be accepted in a particular case – s.27 is frequently used by the police, and the courts must be vigilant about its application to ensure credibility of evidence, as the provision is vulnerable to abuse – However, this does not mean that in every case invocation of s.27 must be seen with suspicion and is to be discarded as perfunctory and unworthy of credence – Evidentiary value to be attached on evidence produced before the court in terms of s.27 cannot be codified or put in a straightjacket formula – It depends upon the facts and circumstances of the case – A holistic and inferential appreciation of evidence is required to be adopted in a case of circumstantial evidence. [Paras 23, 24] Evidence Act, 1872– ss.24-27 – “accused person”, “a person accused of any offence”: Held: The bar u/s.25 applies equally whether or not the person against whom evidence is sought to be led in a criminal trial was in custody at the time of making the confession – For the ban to be effective the person need not have been accused of an offence when he made the confession – The reason is that the expression “accused person” in s.24 and the expression “a person accused of any offence” in ss.26 and 27 have the same connotation, and describe the person against whom evidence is sought to be led in a criminal proceeding – The adjectival clause “accused of any offence” is, therefore, descriptive of the person against whom a confessional statement made by him is declared not provable, and does not predicate a condition of that person at the time of making the statement. [Para 26] Criminal Law – Appellant was accused of the murder of his Uncle and his son – Acquitted in the case relating to the murder of Uncle – Judgment of acquittal – Evidentiary value, if any: Held: Except for the fact that the appellant was taken into custody during the course of investigation for the murder of his Uncle and thereupon his disclosure statement (Exhibit P-37) was recorded, there is no connection between the two offences – Murders were committed on two different dates – Murder trial of his Uncle was primarily based upon an entirely different set of evidence – Conviction of the appellant is sustainable in view of the evidence placed on record in the present case – The judgment of acquittal would not qualify as relevant and of evidentiary value so as to acquit the appellant in the present case. [Para 42] Evidence Act, 1872 – s.27 – Disclosure statement (Exhibit P-37) made by the appellant, convicted – Acquittal of the coaccused – Application of s.27: Held: Acquittal of the co-accused was for want of evidence against them – At best, they were found in possession of the articles connected with the crime on the basis of the disclosure statement (Exhibit P-37) made by the appellant – s.27 of the Evidence Act could not have been applied to the other co-accused as the provision pertains to information that distinctly relates to the discovery of a ‘fact’ that was previously unknown, as opposed to fact already disclosed or known – Once information is given by an accused, the same information cannot be used, even if voluntarily made by a co-accused who is in custody – s.27 does apply to joint disclosures, but this is not one such case – This was precisely the reason given by the trial court to acquit the co-accused – Further, even if Section 8 of the Evidence Act was to apply, it would not have been possible to convict the co-accused – The trial court rightly held other co-accused not guilty. [Para 43] Evidence – Case based on circumstantial evidence – Five golden principles to be satisfied as laid down in Sharad Birdhichand Sarda v. State of Maharashtra [1985] 1 SCR 88 – Conditions to be fulfilled before the false explanation or a false defence can be used by the Court as an additional link to lend an assurance to the court, stated – A distinction has to be drawn between incomplete chain of circumstances and a circumstance after a chain is complete and the defence or explanation given by the accused is found to be false, in which event the said falsehood is added to reinforce the conclusion of the court. [Paras 37, 38] Evidence Act, 1872 – s.106 – Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 – s.313: Held: Appellant in his statement u/s.313 denied all accusations without furnishing any explanation regarding his knowledge of the places from which the dead body was recovered – The failure of the appellant to present evidence on his behalf or to offer any cogent explanation regarding the recovery of the dead body by virtue of his special knowledge must lead to a reasonable adverse inference, by application of the principle u/s.106 of the Evidence Act thus forming an additional link in the chain of circumstances – The additional link further affirms the conclusion of guilt as indicated by the prosecution evidence. [Para 40] Words and Phrases – ‘distinctly’ in s.27, Evidence Act, 1872: Held: The word ‘distinctly’ is used to limit and define the scope of the information and means ‘directly’, ‘indubitably’, ‘strictly’ or ‘unmistakably’ – Only that part of the information which is clear, immediate and a proximate cause of discovery is admissible.

Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967 – Penal Code, 1860 – ss.201/120-B – Arms Act, 1959 – ss. 13/18/20 – The High Court had relied upon the judgment in the case of Hitendra Vishnu Thakur and others vs. The State of Maharashtra and others wherein the Supreme Court was dealing with the provisions of s.20(4) (bb) of the Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act, 1987 and had observed that the period for granting extension of investigation could not be extended in a casual manner – Propriety: Held: In the instant case, the period of 90 days expired on 15.09.2020 – Before the expiry of the said period on the request of the Investigating Officer, the time for investigation was extended by order dated 11.09.2020 for a further period of two months till 11.11.2020 – Investigation was not completed – Public Prosecutor moved another application dated 07.11.2020 requesting for further extension of time for investigation for a period of 30 days as per the provisions contained in s. 43D (2) (b) of UAPA – The said application was allowed by the Trial Court on 10.11.2020 and the period of investigation was further extended till 30.11.2020 – The respondent moved an application on 11.11.2020 itself u/s. 167 of the CrPC for release on bail – The said application was rejected by the Trial Court vide order dated 17.11.2020 – However, the High Court granted the default bail – Reliance placed upon the judgment in the case of Hitendra  Vishnu Thakur by the High Court was misplaced – It was a case relating to TADA, whereas the present case related to UAPA – The provisions under UAPA s.43D(2)(b) are different and give other reasons also for extension of time for investigation – The High Court also committed an error in recording a finding that sanction had already been received prior to the date of making the application for extension in November 2020 – The recording of the said fact is not correct – The Public Prosecutor in the application had clearly mentioned that the sanction u/s. 45(1) of UAPA had been obtained from Government of India, Ministry of Home Affairs and was attached with the case file – However, the sanction u/s. 45(2) of UAPA was awaited from GNCT Delhi and that the sanction u/s. 39 of the Arms Act was to be obtained after the results from the FSL was received – The High Court also fell in error in not taking into consideration the reasons given u/s. 43D(2) (b) were clearly made out and explained in the extension letter dated 07.11.2020 giving the details of the progress of the investigation as also the reasons for detaining the respondent – The High Court also failed to consider that after completing the investigation, Police report u/s. 173(2) CrPC had already been submitted prior to 30.11.2020 which was the last date of the extended period – The High Court committed an error in allowing the petition and granting default bail to the respondent – The impugned order passed by the High Court is set aside. [Paras 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5, 5, 8, 10, 12] Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967 – s.43D(2)(b): Held: From a perusal of the provision i.e. 43 D(2)(b), the extension for investigation could be granted up to a maximum period of 180 days for the following reasons: (i) Completion of the investigation; (ii) Progress in the investigation was explained; and (iii) Specific reasons for detention beyond a period of 90 days.

[Para 12] Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 – Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India (Liquidation Process) Regulations, 2016 – Regn. 29 – Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 – Or. VIII, r.6 – Application of the Provisions of statutory set-off to Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process: Held: The provisions of statutory set-off in terms of Or. VIII, r. 6 of CPC or insolvency set-off as permitted by Regulation 29 of the Liquidation Regulations cannot be applied to the Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process – The aforesaid rule would be, however, subject to two exceptions or situations – The first, if at all it can be called an exception, is where a party is entitled to contractual set-off, on the date which is effective before or on the date the Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process is put into motion or commences – The reason is simple – The Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process does not preclude application of contractual set-off – The second exception will be in the case of ‘equitable set-off’ when the claim and counter claim in the form of set-off are linked and connected on account of one or more transactions that can be treated as one – The set-off should be genuine and clearly established on facts and in law, so as to make it inequitable and unfair that the debtor be asked to pay money, without adjustment sought that is fully justified and legal – The amount to be adjusted should be a quantifiable and unquestionable monetary claim, as the Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process is a time-bound summary procedure. [Paras 30 and 32] Words and Phrases – Set-off – Meaning of: Held: Set-off in generic sense recognises the right of a debtor to adjust the smaller claim owed to him against the larger claim payable to his creditor – Set-off is given legal preference for three reasons – First, in economic terms, set-off is a form of security recognised in law – It is, however, not a security in a strict sense, but a right that enhances provision of credit and acts as a stimulus to trade and commerce by giving a degree of confidence to parties dealing with each other – Secondly, it helps reduce litigation, promotes economy of time and is an efficient method in resolving debt between parties – Thirdly, natural equity requires that crossdemands should compensate each other by deducting the lesser sum from the greater – At least five different meanings can be ascribed to the term ‘set-off’, namely, (a) statutory or legal set-off; (b) common law set-off; (c) equitable set-off; (d) contractual set-off; and (e) insolvency set-off. [Paras 3, 4 and 5] Words and Phrases – Contractual set-off – Meaning of: Held: Contractual set-off is a matter of agreement, rather than a separate application of set-off – The parties are free to mutually agree on the outcomes they desire – Being consensual, when expressly stated, the normal rules of set-off regarding mutuality of credits or debts, liquid debts, and connected debts-aspects relevant and noticed below while dealing with statutory/legal set-offs or even insolvency set-off - may not apply – The contract, however, should be within bounds of legality and public policy – Further, the normal requirements of the law of contracts, viz. intention to create legal relationship, acceptance, consideration etc. should be established for a valid contractual set-off – Ascertaining the applicability of contractual set-off requires an assessment of the understanding whether the right is conferred by the agreement, as the court gives effect to the intention of the parties as to how they should deal – The right to set-off may be explicit in the words of the agreement, or can be gathered by existence of oral or implied agreement to set-off, reflecting an understanding to the said effect. [Paras 6 and 7] Words and Phrases – Statutory or legal set-off: Held: Statutory or legal set-off is created by a statute – For example, Order VIII Rule 6 of the CPC states that where a suit for recovery of money is filed, the defendant can claim set-off against the plaintiff’s demand for any ascertained sum of money legally recoverable by the defendant from the plaintiff, but not exceeding the pecuniary limits of the jurisdiction of the court – It requires that both the parties should fill the same character as they fill in the plaintiff’s suit. [Para 8] Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India (Liquidation Process) Regulations, 2016 – Regn. 29 – Mutual dealings: Held: The expression ‘mutual dealings’ for the purpose of Regulation 29 of the Liquidation Regulations, is wider than the statutory set-off postulated under Order VIII Rule 6 of CPC, as well as, equitable set-off under the common law as applicable in India – Insolvency set-off applies when demands are between the same parties – There must be commonality of identity between the person who has made the claim and the person against whom the claim exists – Even when there are several distinct and independent transactions, mutuality can exist between the same parties functioning in the same right or capacity – Mutual dealings are not so much concerned with the nature of the claims, but with the relationship and apposite identity of the parties giving rise to the respective claims, such that it would offend one’s sense of fairness or justice to allow one to be enforced without regard to the other.

[Para 12] Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 – Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India (Liquidation Process) Regulations, 2016 – Regn. 29 – Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 – Or. VIII, r.6 – Application of the Provisions of statutory set-off to Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process: Held: The provisions of statutory set-off in terms of Or. VIII, r. 6 of CPC or insolvency set-off as permitted by Regulation 29 of the Liquidation Regulations cannot be applied to the Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process – The aforesaid rule would be, however, subject to two exceptions or situations – The first, if at all it can be called an exception, is where a party is entitled to contractual set-off, on the date which is effective before or on the date the Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process is put into motion or commences – The reason is simple – The Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process does not preclude application of contractual set-off – The second exception will be in the case of ‘equitable set-off’ when the claim and counter claim in the form of set-off are linked and connected on account of one or more transactions that can be treated as one – The set-off should be genuine and clearly established on facts and in law, so as to make it inequitable and unfair that the debtor be asked to pay money, without adjustment sought that is fully justified and legal – The amount to be adjusted should be a quantifiable and unquestionable monetary claim, as the Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process is a time-bound summary procedure. [Paras 30 and 32] Words and Phrases – Set-off – Meaning of: Held: Set-off in generic sense recognises the right of a debtor to adjust the smaller claim owed to him against the larger claim payable to his creditor – Set-off is given legal preference for three reasons – First, in economic terms, set-off is a form of security recognised in law – It is, however, not a security in a strict sense, but a right that enhances provision of credit and acts as a stimulus to trade and commerce by giving a degree of confidence to parties dealing with each other – Secondly, it helps reduce litigation, promotes economy of time and is an efficient method in resolving debt between parties – Thirdly, natural equity requires that crossdemands should compensate each other by deducting the lesser sum from the greater – At least five different meanings can be ascribed to the term ‘set-off’, namely, (a) statutory or legal set-off; (b) common law set-off; (c) equitable set-off; (d) contractual set-off; and (e) insolvency set-off. [Paras 3, 4 and 5] Words and Phrases – Contractual set-off – Meaning of: Held: Contractual set-off is a matter of agreement, rather than a separate application of set-off – The parties are free to mutually agree on the outcomes they desire – Being consensual, when expressly stated, the normal rules of set-off regarding mutuality of credits or debts, liquid debts, and connected debts-aspects relevant and noticed below while dealing with statutory/legal set-offs or even insolvency set-off - may not apply – The contract, however, should be within bounds of legality and public policy – Further, the normal requirements of the law of contracts, viz. intention to create legal relationship, acceptance, consideration etc. should be established for a valid contractual set-off – Ascertaining the applicability of contractual set-off requires an assessment of the understanding whether the right is conferred by the agreement, as the court gives effect to the intention of the parties as to how they should deal – The right to set-off may be explicit in the words of the agreement, or can be gathered by existence of oral or implied agreement to set-off, reflecting an understanding to the said effect. [Paras 6 and 7] Words and Phrases – Statutory or legal set-off: Held: Statutory or legal set-off is created by a statute – For example, Order VIII Rule 6 of the CPC states that where a suit for recovery of money is filed, the defendant can claim set-off against the plaintiff’s demand for any ascertained sum of money legally recoverable by the defendant from the plaintiff, but not exceeding the pecuniary limits of the jurisdiction of the court – It requires that both the parties should fill the same character as they fill in the plaintiff’s suit. [Para 8] Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India (Liquidation Process) Regulations, 2016 – Regn. 29 – Mutual dealings: Held: The expression ‘mutual dealings’ for the purpose of Regulation 29 of the Liquidation Regulations, is wider than the statutory set-off postulated under Order VIII Rule 6 of CPC, as well as, equitable set-off under the common law as applicable in India – Insolvency set-off applies when demands are between the same parties – There must be commonality of identity between the person who has made the claim and the person against whom the claim exists – Even when there are several distinct and independent transactions, mutuality can exist between the same parties functioning in the same right or capacity – Mutual dealings are not so much concerned with the nature of the claims, but with the relationship and apposite identity of the parties giving rise to the respective claims, such that it would offend one’s sense of fairness or justice to allow one to be enforced without regard to the other.

[Para 12] Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 – Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India (Liquidation Process) Regulations, 2016 – Regn. 29 – Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 – Or. VIII, r.6 – Application of the Provisions of statutory set-off to Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process: Held: The provisions of statutory set-off in terms of Or. VIII, r. 6 of CPC or insolvency set-off as permitted by Regulation 29 of the Liquidation Regulations cannot be applied to the Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process – The aforesaid rule would be, however, subject to two exceptions or situations – The first, if at all it can be called an exception, is where a party is entitled to contractual set-off, on the date which is effective before or on the date the Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process is put into motion or commences – The reason is simple – The Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process does not preclude application of contractual set-off – The second exception will be in the case of ‘equitable set-off’ when the claim and counter claim in the form of set-off are linked and connected on account of one or more transactions that can be treated as one – The set-off should be genuine and clearly established on facts and in law, so as to make it inequitable and unfair that the debtor be asked to pay money, without adjustment sought that is fully justified and legal – The amount to be adjusted should be a quantifiable and unquestionable monetary claim, as the Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process is a time-bound summary procedure. [Paras 30 and 32] Words and Phrases – Set-off – Meaning of: Held: Set-off in generic sense recognises the right of a debtor to adjust the smaller claim owed to him against the larger claim payable to his creditor – Set-off is given legal preference for three reasons – First, in economic terms, set-off is a form of security recognised in law – It is, however, not a security in a strict sense, but a right that enhances provision of credit and acts as a stimulus to trade and commerce by giving a degree of confidence to parties dealing with each other – Secondly, it helps reduce litigation, promotes economy of time and is an efficient method in resolving debt between parties – Thirdly, natural equity requires that crossdemands should compensate each other by deducting the lesser sum from the greater – At least five different meanings can be ascribed to the term ‘set-off’, namely, (a) statutory or legal set-off; (b) common law set-off; (c) equitable set-off; (d) contractual set-off; and (e) insolvency set-off. [Paras 3, 4 and 5] Words and Phrases – Contractual set-off – Meaning of: Held: Contractual set-off is a matter of agreement, rather than a separate application of set-off – The parties are free to mutually agree on the outcomes they desire – Being consensual, when expressly stated, the normal rules of set-off regarding mutuality of credits or debts, liquid debts, and connected debts-aspects relevant and noticed below while dealing with statutory/legal set-offs or even insolvency set-off - may not apply – The contract, however, should be within bounds of legality and public policy – Further, the normal requirements of the law of contracts, viz. intention to create legal relationship, acceptance, consideration etc. should be established for a valid contractual set-off – Ascertaining the applicability of contractual set-off requires an assessment of the understanding whether the right is conferred by the agreement, as the court gives effect to the intention of the parties as to how they should deal – The right to set-off may be explicit in the words of the agreement, or can be gathered by existence of oral or implied agreement to set-off, reflecting an understanding to the said effect. [Paras 6 and 7] Words and Phrases – Statutory or legal set-off: Held: Statutory or legal set-off is created by a statute – For example, Order VIII Rule 6 of the CPC states that where a suit for recovery of money is filed, the defendant can claim set-off against the plaintiff’s demand for any ascertained sum of money legally recoverable by the defendant from the plaintiff, but not exceeding the pecuniary limits of the jurisdiction of the court – It requires that both the parties should fill the same character as they fill in the plaintiff’s suit. [Para 8] Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India (Liquidation Process) Regulations, 2016 – Regn. 29 – Mutual dealings: Held: The expression ‘mutual dealings’ for the purpose of Regulation 29 of the Liquidation Regulations, is wider than the statutory set-off postulated under Order VIII Rule 6 of CPC, as well as, equitable set-off under the common law as applicable in India – Insolvency set-off applies when demands are between the same parties – There must be commonality of identity between the person who has made the claim and the person against whom the claim exists – Even when there are several distinct and independent transactions, mutuality can exist between the same parties functioning in the same right or capacity – Mutual dealings are not so much concerned with the nature of the claims, but with the relationship and apposite identity of the parties giving rise to the respective claims, such that it would offend one’s sense of fairness or justice to allow one to be enforced without regard to the other.

        "HeadNote": " Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 – clause (a) to subsection (2) of s.25, s.238, s.243 – Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India (Liquidation Process) Regulations, 2016 – Regn. 29 – The appellant-Airtel entities argued that they are entitled to statutory set-off or insolvency set-off, in the Corporate Insolvency Resolution Proceedings under Chapter II Part II of the IBC: Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 – Difference between the Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process and the liquidation process: Held: There is a difference between the Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process and the liquidation process of the IBC – The Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process focuses on and fosters rehabilitation, revival and resolution of the corporate debtor, whereas the liquidation process focuses on the constellation of assets of the company in liquidation, and distribution and payment to the creditors from the liquidation estate in terms of the order of preference set out in the insolvency statute. [Para 12] Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 – Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India (Liquidation Process) Regulations, 2016 – Regn. 29 – Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 – Or. VIII, r.6 – Application of the Provisions of statutory set-off to Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process: Held: The provisions of statutory set-off in terms of Or. VIII, r. 6 of CPC or insolvency set-off as permitted by Regulation 29 of the Liquidation Regulations cannot be applied to the Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process – The aforesaid rule would be, however, subject to two exceptions or situations – The first, if at all it can be called an exception, is where a party is entitled to contractual set-off, on the date which is effective before or on the date the Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process is put into motion or commences – The reason is simple – The Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process does not preclude application of contractual set-off – The second exception will be in the case of ‘equitable set-off’ when the claim and counter claim in the form of set-off are linked and connected on account of one or more transactions that can be treated as one – The set-off should be genuine and clearly established on facts and in law, so as to make it inequitable and unfair that the debtor be asked to pay money, without adjustment sought that is fully justified and legal – The amount to be adjusted should be a quantifiable and unquestionable monetary claim, as the Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process is a time-bound summary procedure. [Paras 30 and 32] Words and Phrases – Set-off – Meaning of: Held: Set-off in generic sense recognises the right of a debtor to adjust the smaller claim owed to him against the larger claim payable to his creditor – Set-off is given legal preference for three reasons – First, in economic terms, set-off is a form of security recognised in law – It is, however, not a security in a strict sense, but a right that enhances provision of credit and acts as a stimulus to trade and commerce by giving a degree of confidence to parties dealing with each other – Secondly, it helps reduce litigation, promotes economy of time and is an efficient method in resolving debt between parties – Thirdly, natural equity requires that crossdemands should compensate each other by deducting the lesser sum from the greater – At least five different meanings can be ascribed to the term ‘set-off’, namely, (a) statutory or legal set-off; (b) common law set-off; (c) equitable set-off; (d) contractual set-off; and (e) insolvency set-off. [Paras 3, 4 and 5] Words and Phrases – Contractual set-off – Meaning of: Held: Contractual set-off is a matter of agreement, rather than a separate application of set-off – The parties are free to mutually agree on the outcomes they desire – Being consensual, when expressly stated, the normal rules of set-off regarding mutuality of credits or debts, liquid debts, and connected debts-aspects relevant and noticed below while dealing with statutory/legal set-offs or even insolvency set-off - may not apply – The contract, however, should be within bounds of legality and public policy – Further, the normal requirements of the law of contracts, viz. intention to create legal relationship, acceptance, consideration etc. should be established for a valid contractual set-off – Ascertaining the applicability of contractual set-off requires an assessment of the understanding whether the right is conferred by the agreement, as the court gives effect to the intention of the parties as to how they should deal – The right to set-off may be explicit in the words of the agreement, or can be gathered by existence of oral or implied agreement to set-off, reflecting an understanding to the said effect. [Paras 6 and 7] Words and Phrases – Statutory or legal set-off: Held: Statutory or legal set-off is created by a statute – For example, Order VIII Rule 6 of the CPC states that where a suit for recovery of money is filed, the defendant can claim set-off against the plaintiff’s demand for any ascertained sum of money legally recoverable by the defendant from the plaintiff, but not exceeding the pecuniary limits of the jurisdiction of the court – It requires that both the parties should fill the same character as they fill in the plaintiff’s suit. [Para 8] Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India (Liquidation Process) Regulations, 2016 – Regn. 29 – Mutual dealings: Held: The expression ‘mutual dealings’ for the purpose of Regulation 29 of the Liquidation Regulations, is wider than the statutory set-off postulated under Order VIII Rule 6 of CPC, as well as, equitable set-off under the common law as applicable in India – Insolvency set-off applies when demands are between the same parties – There must be commonality of identity between the person who has made the claim and the person against whom the claim exists – Even when there are several distinct and independent transactions, mutuality can exist between the same parties functioning in the same right or capacity – Mutual dealings are not so much concerned with the nature of the claims, but with the relationship and apposite identity of the parties giving rise to the respective claims, such that it would offend one’s sense of fairness or justice to allow one to be enforced without regard to the other.

[Para 67]  Constitution of India – Art. 32 – Investigation conducted by SEBI into the allegations that the Adani group manipulated its share prices and failed to disclose transactions with related parties – SEBI’s regulatory domain – Scope of judicial review: Held: Courts do not and cannot act as appellate authorities examining the correctness, suitability, and appropriateness of a policy, nor are courts advisors to expert regulatory agencies on matters of policy which they are entitled to formulate – Scope of judicial review, when examining a policy framed by a specialized regulator, is to scrutinize whether it violates the fundamental rights of the citizens; is contrary to the provisions of the Constitution; is opposed to a statutory provision; or is manifestly arbitrary – Legality of the policy, and not the wisdom or soundness of the policy, is the subject of judicial review – When technical questions arise particularly in the domain of economic or financial matters and experts in the field have expressed their views and such views are duly considered by the statutory regulator, the resultant policies or subordinate legislative framework ought not to be interfered with – SEBI’s wide powers, coupled with its expertise and robust information gathering mechanism, lend a high level of credibility to its decisions as a regulatory, adjudicatory and prosecuting agency – Court must be mindful of the public interest that guides the functioning of SEBI and refrain from substituting its own wisdom in place of the actions of SEBI. [Paras 17 ] Constitution of India – Art. 32 – Investigation conducted by SEBI into the allegations that the Adani group manipulated its share prices and failed to disclose transactions with elated parties and other information in violation of the SEBI regulations – Regulatory failure, if attributable to SEBI: Held: No reason to interfere with the regulations made by SEBI in the exercise of its delegated legislative powers – SEBI has traced the evolution of its regulatory framework, and explained the reasons for the changes in its regulations – Procedure followed in arriving at the current shape of the regulations is not tainted with any illegality – There are no submissions that the regulations are unreasonable, capricious, arbitrary, or violative of the Constitution – Petitioners have not challenged the vires of the Regulations but have contended that there is regulatory failure based on SEBI’s alleged inability to investigate which is attributed to changes in the regulations – Such a ground is unknown to this Court’s jurisprudence – Critique of the regulations made as an afterthought and based on a value judgment of economic policy is impermissible – Prayer seeking directions to SEBI to revoke its amendments to the FPI Regulations and LODR Regulations must fail – No valid grounds have been raised for this Court to direct SEBI to revoke its amendments to the FPI Regulations and the LODR Regulations which were made in exercise of its delegated legislative power – Thus, the procedure followed in arriving at the current shape of the regulations does not suffer from irregularity or illegality – FPI Regulations and LODR Regulations have been tightened by the amendments in question. [Para 28, 29, 30, 67c] Constitution of India – Arts. 32 and 142 – Transfer of the investigation from SEBI to another agency or to SIT – Power of: Held: Court does have the power u/Art. 32 and 142 to transfer an investigation from the authorized agency to the CBI or constitute an SIT – However, such powers must be exercised sparingly and in extraordinary circumstances – Unless the authority statutorily entrusted with the power to investigate portrays a glaring, willful and deliberate inaction in carrying out the investigation, the court will ordinarily not supplant the authority which has been vested with the power to investigate – Such powers must not be exercised by the court in the absence of cogent justification indicative of a likely failure of justice in the absence of the exercise of the power to transfer – Petitioner must place on record strong evidence indicating that the investigating agency has portrayed inadequacy in investigation or prima facie appears to be biased.[Para 32] Constitution of India – Arts. 32 – Investigation – Comprehensive investigation conducted by SEBI into the allegations that the Adani group manipulated its share prices and failed to disclose transactions with related parties: Held: Out of the twenty-four investigations carried out by SEBI, twenty-two are concluded – Twenty-two final investigation reports and one interim investigation report have been approved by the competent authority under SEBI’s procedures – As regards the delay of only ten days in filing the report, such a delay does not prima facie indicate deliberate inaction by SEBI, when the issue involved a complex investigation in coordination with various agencies, both domestic and foreign – No apparent regulatory failure can be attributed to SEBI based on the material before this Court – Thus, prima facie no deliberate inaction or inadequacy in the investigation by SEBI. [Paras 35, 37, 38]. Constitution of India – Arts. 32 – Investigation conducted by SEBI into the allegations levelled against the Adani group – Adequacy of SEBI’s investigation – Challange to – Reliance on the OCCRP report of a third-party organization and the letter by DRI: Held: Reliance on newspaper articles or reports by third-party organizations to question a comprehensive investigation by a specialized regulator does not inspire confidence – Such reports by “independent” groups or investigative pieces by newspapers may act as inputs before SEBI or the Expert Committee – However, they cannot be relied on as conclusive proof of the inadequacy of the investigation by SEBI nor, can such inputs be regarded as “credible evidence” – Also the petitioner’s assertion that SEBI was lackadaisical in its investigation is not borne out from the reference to the letter sent by the DRI. [Paras 40, 43] Shares and securities – Short selling – Meaning of: Held: Short selling is a sale of securities which the seller does not own but borrows from another entity, with the hope of repurchasing them at a later date with a lower price, thus, attempting to profit from an anticipated decline in the price of the securities – In its report, Hindenburg Research admits to taking a short position in the Adani group through US-traded bonds and non-Indian traded derivative instruments – SEBI has submitted that short selling is a desirable and essential feature to provide liquidity and to help price correction in over-valued stocks and hence, short selling is recognised as a legitimate investment activity by securities market regulators in most countries – Short selling is regulated by a circular notified by SEBI on 20 December 2007 – Any restrictions on short selling, may distort efficient price discovery, provide promoters unfettered freedom to manipulate prices, and favour manipulators rather than rational investors – Thus, the International Organisation of Securities Commission recommends that short selling be regulated but not prohibited with an aim to increase transparency – Measures to regulate short selling will be considered by the Government of India and SEBI. [Para 58] Constitution of India – Arts. 32 – Public interest jurisprudence under – Scope of: Held: It was expanded by this Court to secure access to justice and provide ordinary citizens with the opportunity to highlight legitimate causes before this Court – It has served as a tool to secure justice and ensure accountability on many occasions, where ordinary citizens have approached the Court with well-researched petitions that highlight a clear cause of action – However, petitions that lack adequate research and rely on unverified and unrelated material tend to, in fact, be counterproductive – This word of caution must be kept in mind by lawyers and members of civil society alike. [Para 68] Constitution of India – Arts. 32 – Allegations that the Adani group manipulated its share prices and failed to disclose transactions with related parties – Recommendations of the Expert Committee to strengthen regulatory framework and secure compliance to protect investors – Elucidated.

[Para 67]  Constitution of India – Art. 32 – Investigation conducted by SEBI into the allegations that the Adani group manipulated its share prices and failed to disclose transactions with related parties – SEBI’s regulatory domain – Scope of judicial review: Held: Courts do not and cannot act as appellate authorities examining the correctness, suitability, and appropriateness of a policy, nor are courts advisors to expert regulatory agencies on matters of policy which they are entitled to formulate – Scope of judicial review, when examining a policy framed by a specialized regulator, is to scrutinize whether it violates the fundamental rights of the citizens; is contrary to the provisions of the Constitution; is opposed to a statutory provision; or is manifestly arbitrary – Legality of the policy, and not the wisdom or soundness of the policy, is the subject of judicial review – When technical questions arise particularly in the domain of economic or financial matters and experts in the field have expressed their views and such views are duly considered by the statutory regulator, the resultant policies or subordinate legislative framework ought not to be interfered with – SEBI’s wide powers, coupled with its expertise and robust information gathering mechanism, lend a high level of credibility to its decisions as a regulatory, adjudicatory and prosecuting agency – Court must be mindful of the public interest that guides the functioning of SEBI and refrain from substituting its own wisdom in place of the actions of SEBI. [Paras 17 ] Constitution of India – Art. 32 – Investigation conducted by SEBI into the allegations that the Adani group manipulated its share prices and failed to disclose transactions with elated parties and other information in violation of the SEBI regulations – Regulatory failure, if attributable to SEBI: Held: No reason to interfere with the regulations made by SEBI in the exercise of its delegated legislative powers – SEBI has traced the evolution of its regulatory framework, and explained the reasons for the changes in its regulations – Procedure followed in arriving at the current shape of the regulations is not tainted with any illegality – There are no submissions that the regulations are unreasonable, capricious, arbitrary, or violative of the Constitution – Petitioners have not challenged the vires of the Regulations but have contended that there is regulatory failure based on SEBI’s alleged inability to investigate which is attributed to changes in the regulations – Such a ground is unknown to this Court’s jurisprudence – Critique of the regulations made as an afterthought and based on a value judgment of economic policy is impermissible – Prayer seeking directions to SEBI to revoke its amendments to the FPI Regulations and LODR Regulations must fail – No valid grounds have been raised for this Court to direct SEBI to revoke its amendments to the FPI Regulations and the LODR Regulations which were made in exercise of its delegated legislative power – Thus, the procedure followed in arriving at the current shape of the regulations does not suffer from irregularity or illegality – FPI Regulations and LODR Regulations have been tightened by the amendments in question.

Constitution of India – Arts. 32 – Investigation conducted by SEBI into the allegations levelled against the Adani group – Adequacy of SEBI’s investigation – Challange to – Reliance on the OCCRP report of a third-party organization and the letter by DRI: Held: Reliance on newspaper articles or reports by third-party organizations to question a comprehensive investigation by a specialized regulator does not inspire confidence – Such reports by “independent” groups or investigative pieces by newspapers may act as inputs before SEBI or the Expert Committee – However, they cannot be relied on as conclusive proof of the inadequacy of the investigation by SEBI nor, can such inputs be regarded as “credible evidence” – Also the petitioner’s assertion that SEBI was lackadaisical in its investigation is not borne out from the reference to the letter sent by the DRI.
