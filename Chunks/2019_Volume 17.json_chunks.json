inthe same manner as if it were a decree of the Court – The raisond’etre for s.36 is only to make it clear that when an arbitral awardis not susceptible to challenge, either because the time for makingan application to set it aside has expired, or such applicationhaving been made is refused, the award, being final and binding,shall be enforced under the CPC, as if it were a decree of the court– To read s.36 as inferring something negative, namely, that wherethe time for making an application under s.34 has not expired and,therefore, on such application being made within time, anautomatic-stay ensues, is to read something into s.36 which is notthere at all – Automatic stay of award is, therefore, not a rule –Also, this construction omits to consider the rest of s.36, whichdeals with applications under s.34 that have been dismissed, whichleads to an award being final and binding when read with s.35which then becomes enforceable under the CPC, the award beingtreated as a decree for this purpose – This is also supported bythe language of s.9 of the Arbitration Act, 1996, which specificallyenables a party to apply to a Court for reliefs “…after the makingof the arbitration award but before it is enforced in accordancewith s.36.” – These words in s.9 have not undergone any changeby reason of the 2015 or 2019 Amendment Acts – Further, s.36,even as originally enacted, was not meant to do away withArt.36(2) of the UNCITRAL Model Law, but is really meant to doaway with the two bites at the cherry doctrine in the context ofawards made in India, and the fact that enforcement of a finalaward, when read with s.35, is to be under the CPC, treating theaward as if it were a decree of the court – The amended s.36, being clarificatory in nature, merely restates the position that theunamended s.36 does not stand in the way of the law as to grantof stay of a money decree under the provisions of the CPC.Arbitration and Conciliation (Amendment) Act, 2019: s.13 –Removal of basis of *BCCI judgment by Amendment Act, 2019 –Whether 2019 Amendment Act removes the basis of *BCCIjudgment of Supreme Court – Held: Argument that the question ofremoving the basis of a judgment cannot arise unless and until thejudgment is present in the mind of the legislature and expresslyreferred to in the concerned Statement of Objects and Reasons isrejected – What is important is to see whether in substance, thebasis of a particular judgment is in fact removed, and not whetherthat judgment is referred to in the Statement of Objects and Reasonsof the amending act which seeks to remove its basis – Furtherargument that s.87 is nothing but a rehash of s.26 is also rejected– The scheme of s.87 is different from that of s.26, and is explicitin stating that court proceedings are merely parasitical on arbitralproceedings – It is, therefore, clear that only arbitral proceedingshave to be looked at to see whether the 2015 Amendment Act kicksin – Argument that in the instant case there was a direct assaulton a judgment of this Court without first removing its basis is,therefore, rejected – Legislative competence – Arbitration andConciliation Act, 1996.Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996: s.87 – Constitutionalvalidity of introduction of s.87 into the Arbitration Act, 1996, anddeletion of s.26 of the 2015 Amendment Act by the 2019 AmendmentAct – Held: The law on s.26 of the 2015 Amendment Act was laiddown in *BCCI with great clarity – After construing s.26, the Courtcautioned the Government that the immediate effect of enacting theproposed s.87 would be directly contrary to the Statement andObjects and Reasons of the 2015 Amendment Act, which made itclear that the law prior to the 2015 Amendment Act resulted indelay of disposal of arbitral proceedings and an increase ininterference by courts in arbitration matters which tends to defeata primary object of the Arbitration Act, 1996 – To thereafter deletethis salutary provision and introduce s.87 in its place would bewholly without justification and contrary to the object sought tobe achieved by the 2015 Amendment Act, which was enactedpursuant to a detailed Law Commission Report which found various infirmities in the working of the original 1996 statute – Theintroduction of s.87 and deletion of s.26 of the 2015 AmendmentAct was thus manifestly arbitrary having been enactedunreasonably, without adequate determining principle and contraryto the public interest sought to be subserved by the Arbitration Act,1996 and the 2015 Amendment Act – Arbitration and Conciliation(Amendment) Act, 2015 – s.26.Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996: s.34 – It is wellsettled law that an application under s.34 of the Act, 1996 is asummary proceeding not in the nature of a regular suit – As aresult, a court reviewing an arbitral award under s.34 does not sitin appeal over the award, and if the view taken by the arbitratoris possible, no interference is called for.Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016: s.3(7) –Interpretation of term ‘Corporate person’ – Plea that for recoveryof money from Government Companies, the definition of ‘corporateperson’ contained in s.3(7) of the Insolvency Code should eitherbe read without the words “with limited liability” contained in thethird part of the definition or have s.3(23)(g) of the InsolvencyCode, which is the definition of ‘person’ read into the said provision– Held: A statutory body which functions as an extended limb ofthe Central Government, and performs governmental functionscannot be taken over by a resolution professional under theInsolvency Code, or by any other corporate body – Nor can suchAuthority ultimately be wound-up under the Insolvency Code – Forsuch reasons, it is not possible to either read in, or read down,the definition of ‘corporate person’ in s.3(7) of the InsolvencyCode.Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016: Object of – Held:The Insolvency Code is not meant to be a recovery mechanism, theidea of the Code being a mechanism which is triggered in orderthat resolution of stressed assets then takes place.Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016: s.5(6) – Definitionof ‘dispute’ – Held: The definition of ‘dispute’ in s.5(6) of theInsolvency Code deals with a suit or arbitration proceedingsrelating to one of three things - (a) the existence of the amount ofdebt; (b) the quality of goods or service; or (c) the breach of arepresentation or warranty – Insofar as (a) is concerned, the definition of the word ‘debt’ contained in s.3(11) of the InsolvencyCode, refers to a liability or obligation in respect of a claim whichis due from any person – This necessarily postulates the existenceof a contractual or other relationship, which gives rise to a liabilityor obligation between parties in law – The same goes for (c), as abreach of a representation or warranty can only be by onecontracting party to another – Also, when the quality of goods orservice is referred to in (b), this again postulates some contractualor other relationship in law by which one party may sue the other– Therefore, a dispute must be between the parties as understoodunder the Insolvency Code, which does not contain an Or.VIII-ACPC type mechanism – Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 – Or.VIIIA.Constitution of India: Art.32 – Writ jurisdiction, invocationof – Factual disputes between parties relating to exact quantumof arbitral awards in favour of petitioner company – Held: It issettled law that when exercising its jurisdiction under Art.32 of theConstitut ion, Supreme Court cannot embark on a detailedinvestigation of disputed facts – In the instant case, there wasfactual dispute between the parties relating to: (i) the exactquantum of the arbitral awards in favour of the Petitioner companydue from the Respondent PSUs; (ii) the amounts which may havealready been paid and/or deposited by the Respondent PSUs infavour of the Petitioner company under the said arbitral awards;and (iii) whether stay orders of competent Courts were passed inrespect of these arbitral awards, and if so, whether they were underthe automatic-stay mode or not – This Court cannot, therefore, inexercise of its jurisdiction under Art.32 undertake a detailedinvestigation to determine the status of monies paid/depositedpursuant to arbitral-awards in favour of the Petitioner company– Consequently, no directions in respect thereof can be made inthese proceedings.",

The said order challenged by Resolution Professional –NCLT set aside the order of State Government on the ground thatthe same was in violation of moratorium declared in terms of s.14(1)of IBC, 2016

High Court ought to have interfered underArt.226/227 of the Constitution, with an order passed by NCLT inproceeding under the IBC, 2016, despite the availability of astatutory alternative remedy of appeal to NCLAT – Held: Thedecision of the State Government to refuse the benefit of deemedextension of lease, is in the public law domain and, therefore, thecorrectness of the said decision can be called into question onlyin a superior court which is vested with the power of judicial reviewover administrative action – The NCLT, being a creature of a specialstatute to discharge certain specific functions, cannot be elevatedto the status of a superior court having such powers – The NCLTis not even a Civil Court, which has jurisdiction to try all suits ofa civil nature excepting suits, of which their cognizance is eitherexpressly or impliedly barred – Therefore NCLT can exercise onlysuch powers within the contours of jurisdiction as prescribed bythe statute, the law in respect of which, it is called upon toadminister – Though NCLT and NCLAT have jurisdiction to enquireinto questions of fraud, they would not have jurisdiction to adjudicate upon disputes such as those arising under MMDR Act,1957 and the rules issued thereunder, especially when the disputesrevolve around decisions of statutory or quasi-judicial authorities,which can be corrected only by way of judicial review ofadministrative action – The moratorium provided for in s.14 couldnot have any impact upon the right of the Government to refusethe extension of lease – The purpose of moratorium is only topreserve the status quo and not to create a new right – Therefore,NCLT did not have jurisdiction to entertain an application againstthe State Government for a direction to execute Supplemental LeaseDeeds for the extension of the mining lease – Since NCLT choseto exercise a jurisdiction not vested in it in law, the High Courtwas justified in entertaining the writ petition, on the basis that

Fraudulent initiation of CIRPcannot be a ground to bypass the alternative remedy of appealprovided in s.61.Constitut ion of India: Arts.226/227 – Exercise ofjurisdiction, exception – In cases where a statutory alternativeremedy of appeal is available, one of the exceptions to the selfimposed restraint of the High Court is the lack of jurisdiction onthe part of the statutory/quasi-judicial authority, against whoseorder a judicial review is sought – Traditionally, English courtsmaintained a distinction between cases where a statutory/quasijudicialauthority exercised a jurisdiction not vested in it in lawand cases where there was a wrongful exercise of the availablejurisdiction – The distinction between lack of jurisdiction andwrongful exercise of available jurisdiction, should certainly betaken into account by High Courts, when Art.226 is sought to be invoked bypassing a statutory alternative remedy provided by aspecial statute.Constitution of India: Arts.226/227 – Scope of

and PW-5 proceeded to the DESU office – When PW-2approached appellant, he took him to a garment shop on hisscooter and went inside the shop where he asked PW-2 to give themoney – PW-2 gave currency notes to appellant in a polythene bagwhich was put in appellant’s pant pocket as directed by theappellant – PW-3 (panch witness) present in the immediate vicinitygave signal to the raiding party – Inspector (PW-5) in the presenceof PW-2 and PW-3 recovered tainted money from the pant pocketof the appellant – Conviction of appellant by courts below –Challenged on the ground that there were major contradictions onmaterial aspect in the testimonies of prosecution witnesses – Held:Minor discrepancy and inability of prosecution witnesses toremember the exact details of whether or not the handwash or pantwash was done would not justify acquittal of the appellant –Deviations between the testimonies of PW-2 and PW-3 would notmean that the demand and payment of bribe, the trap and seizureof the bribe money was not proved – The contradictions that creptin the testimonies of PW-2 and PW-3 on the question of the totalamount demanded were immaterial and inconsequential as it wasproved that the bribe was demanded and taken by the appellanton fateful day – The variations as highlighted would losesignificance in view of the proven facts on the recovery of bribemoney from the pant pocket of the appellant, on which depositionsof PW-2, PW-3 and PW-5 were identical and not at variance – The money recovered was the currency notes that were treated and notedin the pre- raid proceedings – The contradictions as pointed outwere insignificant when juxtaposed with the vivid and eloquentnarration of incriminating facts proved and established beyonddoubt – Given the time gap of five to six years, minor contradictionson some details were bound to occur and are natural – Thewitnesses are not required to recollect and narrate the entire versionwith photographic memory notwithstanding the hiatus and passageof time – Picayune variations do not in any way negate andcontradict the main and core incriminatory evidence of the demandof bribe, reason why the bribe was demanded and the actual takingof the bribe that was paid, which are the ingredients of the offenceunder ss. 7 and 13 of the Act, that have been proved andestablished beyond reasonable doubt – Documents

High Court.Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988: s.20 – Presumption asto acceptance of illegal gratification – In the case at hand, thecondition precedent to drawing a legal presumption that theaccused demanded and was paid the bribe money was proved andestablished by the incriminating material on record – Thus, thepresumption under s.20 of the Act was applicable for the offencecommitted by the appellant under s.7 of the Act – Appellant wasfound in possession of the bribe money and no reasonableexplanation was furnished that may rebut the presumption.Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988: s.17 – Procedural lapse– Effect on prosecution case – Contention of appellant thatinvestigation was not conducted by the police officer by the rankand status of the Deputy Superintendent of Police or

police officer of the rank of Inspector Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988: s.19 – Sanction forprosecution – Appellant challenged the validity of sanction order– Held: There was no error in the sanction order – What the lawrequires is the application of mind by the Sanctioning authority onthe material placed before it to satisfy itself of prima facie casethat would constitute the offence – Sanctioning authority in hiscross- examination was clear and categoric that he had receivedthe report of the Investigating Officer along with the kalandra oforal and documentary evidence – Sanctioning

Constitution confers the power and authority on the State toenact two separate enactments on a similar subject if they seek toachieve different objectives and protect and preserve different setsof

ofpremises belonging to religious institutions and seeks to regulatetheir rights as landlords vis-a-vis the tenants in occupation –Furthermore, the State legislature while enacting the ReligiousPremises Act was aware that it has enacted East Punjab Rent Act,an existing statute governing landlord and tenant relationship –However, the State legislature in its wisdom deemed it appropriateto enact a law in respect of land and buildings belonging to“religious institutions” – East Punjab Urban Rent RestrictionsAct, 1949.Punjab Religious Premises and Land (Eviction and

proceedings against the tenant under the Religious Premises Act – Plea of tenant that Religious Premises Act createsan artificial classification as tenants of land and buildingsbelonging to or owned by religious institutions are no longerentitled to protection under the East Punjab Rent Act though suchprotection continues to be available to other tenants – Held:Charitable or religious institutions or endownments fall into aseparate category and form a class by themselves – Tenantscoming under them also form a separate class and can be treateddifferently from others – Classification of properties of religiousinstitutions as a separate and distinctive class of properties wouldnot fall foul or be violative of Art. 14 – Granting exemption tobuildings belonging to charities, religious or secular institutions,from rent control legislation, would not offend the equal protectionclause of Art. 14 as it is a reasonable classification based onintelligible differentia and also satisfies the test of nexus as suchinstitutions not only serve public purpose but disbursement of theirincome is governed by the objects for which they are created –Thus, the withdrawal of protection to the tenants of such buildingswas justified – Constitution of India – Art. 14 – East Punjab UrbanRent Restrictions Act, 1949.Punjab Religious Premises and Land (Eviction and RentRecovery) Act, 1997 – s. 3 – “Unauthorised occupation ofreligious premises” – Meaning of – Held: A person is deemed tobe in unauthorised occupation of any religious premises if he has,before or after commencement of the

possessionof the land or building belonging to or owned by a religiousinstitution and has valid and subsisting allotment, lease or grantis clearly not an unauthorised occupant – Valid grants, leases andallotments are not construed and treated as unauthorisedoccupation – It is only when the terms of the grant, lease orallotment are not adhered to or have been determined or the periodof allotment, lease or grant as fixed has come to an end, that theperson in occupation is treated to be in unauthorised occupation– This is a pre-condition which confers the right on the religiousinstitution to seek eviction of a person in unauthorised occupationof the religious premises – Determinative factor in deciding the question of “unauthorised occupation” is the tenure of allotment,lease or the grant and terms and conditions as agreed or stated,and not payment of rent.Punjab Religious Premises and Land (Eviction and RentRecovery) Act, 1997 – ss. 4, 5 – Eviction under – Held: UnderSection 4, a

One crore with the CPCB – Further, noting that theconstruction at the project site had been completed, the NGTappointed a five-member expert committee to study the impact ofthe appellant’s expanded project and to suggest remedial measures– In the instant appeal challenge was made to this order of theNGT – Held: The entire scheme of the EIA Notification is to ensure that any new or additional environmental impact is assessed andcertified by the relevant regulatory authorities – The lower limitof Entry 8(a) of the Schedule is a built up area of 20,000 sq. mtrsand the upper limit is 1,50,000 sq. mtrs – No doubt, theenvironmental impact of a construction of 1,50,000 sq. mtrs wouldbe drastically more than construction of 20,000 sq. mtrs – It cannotbe disputed that as the size of the project increases, so does themagnitude of the project’s environmental impact – There may existcertain situations where the expansion sought by a projectproponent is truly marginal or the environmental impact of suchexpansion is non-existent – However, it is not for this Court to laydown a bright-line test as to what constitutes a ‘marginal’ increaseand what constitutes a material increase warranting a fresh Form1 and scrutiny by the Expert Appraisal Committee – Thus, anexpansion within the limits prescribed by the Schedules would besubject to the procedure set out in paragraph 7(ii) – At the time ofthe second increase, the total construction area of the appellant’sproject was enlarged to 40,480.88 sq.mtrs – As a result ofexpansion, appellant constructed sixteen addi tional flats –Appellant did not comply with the procedure set out underparagraph 7(ii) of the EIA Notification but rather sought an‘amendment’ to the EC – SEIAA did not require the appellant tosubmit an updated Form 1 nor was the proposal processed andevaluated by SEAC – The ‘amendment’ to EC dated 13.03.2014did not discuss the potential environmental impact of the increasein construction area – The procedure set out under paragraph 7(ii)of the EIA Notification exists to ensure that where a project isexpanded in size, the environmental impact on the surrounding areais evaluated holistically considering all the relevant factorsincluding air and water availability and pollution, management ofsolid and wet waste and the urban carrying capacity of the area– This was not done in the case of the appellant’s project – It wasnot open to SEIAA to grant an ‘amendment’ to the EC withoutfollowing the procedure set out in paragraph 7(ii) of the EIANotification – Further, as on the date of the impugned orderconstruction at the project site had already been completed – Bycompleting the construction of the project, the appellant deniedSEIAA and SEAC, the ability to evaluate the environmental impact and suggest methods to mitigate any environmental damage – Atthis stage, only remedial measures may be taken – The NGT alreadydirected the appellant to deposit one crore and has set up an expertcommittee to evaluate the impact of the appellant’s project andsuggest remedial measures – In view of these circumstances, thedirections of the NGT are upheld and the Committee is directed tocontinue its evaluation of the appellant’s project so as to bring itsenvironmental impact as close as possible to that contemplated inEC dated 02.05.2013 and also suggest the compensatory exactionto be imposed on the appellant.Interpretation of Statutes: Interpretation of Notification – Ina case where the text of the provisions requires interpretation,Courts must adopt an interpretation which is in consonance withthe object and purpose of the legislation or delegated legislationas a whole – EIA Notification was adopted with the intention ofrestricting new projects and the expansion of new projects untiltheir environmental impact could be evaluated and understood –Environmental law",

hishouse – The alleged contract killer came as a courier boy wearingblack cap and goggles – The wife of the complainant identifiedhim in investigation – As per the version of son/nephew andbrothers of the deceased, the deceased had invested a substantialamount of money in committees run by accused-SCB and his sonaccused-SB which they were reluctant to return and were alsotrying to usurp share of the deceased in a factory – Statement ofanother brother of the deceased was that he and his son werereceiving threatening calls from accused-NM, accused-LM andtheir associates and that these accused were responsible for murderof deceased – NM, LM and accused-Advocate-RS were arrestedwhen they were travelling in a car and black photo frame, blackcap, black goggles and a photo of the deceased were recoveredfrom the car – NM got the Getz car recovered from the house inhis village, in which the contract killer – JSS allegedly travelledto the site of occurrence to murder the deceased – The unlicensedpistol along with two live cartridges were recovered from the officeof accused-SS – During investigation, the Call Detail Records ofthe accused were collected by the Investigating Officer – As perthe version of the prosecution, NM had asked his cousin brotherLM to carry out the murder – Af ter initial ly agreeing, LMsubsequently backed out – Thereafter, JSS was asked to executethe murder – F.S.L Report recorded that the lead recovered fromthe body of the deceased was fired from the pistol recovered fromthe office of SS – As per the report of the handwriting expert, thespecimen handwriting of JSS matched the writing on the envelopewhich allegedly was carried by JSS to the house of the deceased– NM borrowed a car, unlicenced pistol with five cartridges and took JSS to the place of occurrence and waited in the car for JSSwhile he went to murder the deceased and then helped JSS to getaway – NM was in continuous contact with accused-SB before andafter the incident – The records of the committees run by SCB wereallegedly destroyed by him – This would a strong suspicion aboutthe conduct of SCB – The destruction of the records of thecommittees, which would have revealed the substantial investmentsmade by the deceased was an incriminating factor – Thecircumstance of absconding of accused immediately after themurder would be also admissible as relevant ‘conduct’ under s.8of the Evidence Act – The contemporaneous Call Detail Records(CDRs) between SB and NM, who accompanied JSS would alsoconstitute strong material for framing the charge against all theaccused – Charge Sheet was filed against all the accused –Sessions Court held that there was common intention between NMand JSS in the act of killing the deceased – However LM wasdischarged as there was not sufficient evidence to connect him withthe crime – With respect to RS, it was held that evidence was notsufficient to frame charges against him as he had only tenderedadvice to NM to the effect that he should not use his licensed pistolfor carrying out the murder – With respect to SS, the Sessions Courtheld that the unlicensed pistol along with two live cartridges wererecovered from his office and charged him only for the offence u/S. 25 of the Arms Act for keeping an unlicensed firearm in hispossession – Sessions Court discharged SCB since the prosecutionhad collected evidence against him only in the form of disclosurestatements from the accused persons after arrest – Sessions Courtcharged SB for the offence u/S. 25 of the Arms Act, since he gotthe licensed pistol belonging to NM recovered from his factorypremises – Sessions Court held that the prosecution failed to makeout a prima facie case against RS, LM, SCB who were discharged– The State and the complainant filed Revision before the HighCourt – High Court held that NM, SB, JSS were to be charged u/s.302 read with s.34 IPC read with 120B IPC – The Judgment ofthe Sessions Court ordering discharge of SCB, SS, LM, RS wasaffirmed by the High Court – Hence the instant appeal by the Stateand the complainant – Held: The present case is one where theprosecution has alleged that there was a criminal conspiracy tomurder the deceased by all the accused – The crime was not committed at the spur of the moment, but was preceded bymeticulous planning where each of the accused played a separaterole to achieve the common illegal object of carrying out themurder of the deceased – The manner and circumstances in whichthe offence was committed, and the level of involvement of theaccused persons were relevant factors – Each conspirator playedhis separate part in one integrated and united effort to achievethe common purpose – Each one was aware that he has a part toplay in the general conspiracy, to accomplish the common object– Conspiracy is mostly proved by circumstantial evidence by takinginto account the cumulative effect of the circumstances indicatingthe guilt of the accused, rather than adopting an approach byisolating the role played by each of the accused – The acts orconduct of the parties must be conscious and clear enough to infertheir concurrence as to the common design and its execution – Incases of criminal conspiracy, better evidence than acts andstatements of co-conspirators is hardly ever available – There wasample material brought on record which created a grave suspicionabout the involvement of SCB, LM, SS in the murder of the deceased– Accordingly, Sessions Court is directed to frame charges againstSCB under s.302 r/w s.34 IPC and s.120B and s.201; LM unders.302 r/w s.34 and s.120B; and against SS under s.302 r/w s.34and s.120B and ss.25, 27, 54 and 59 of Arms Act – Penal Code,1860 – s.302 r/w s.34.Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973: ss.227, 228 – Scope of– Held: The Court while considering the question of framingcharges under s.227 has the power to sift and weigh the evidencefor the limited purpose of finding out whether or not a prima faciecase has been made out against the accused – If the materialplaced before the court discloses grave suspicion against theaccused, which has not been properly explained, the court will befully justified in framing charges and proceeding with the trial –At this stage, there cannot be a roving enquiry into the pros andcons of the matter, the evidence is not to be weighed as if a trial isbeing conducted.Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973: ss.223, 386, 391 – Held:s.223 provides that persons accused of the same offence, committedin the course of the same transaction, must be jointly charged andtried – In the instant

the deceased, the deceased had invested a substantialamount of money in committees run by accused-SCB and his sonaccused-SB which they were reluctant to return and were alsotrying to usurp share of the deceased in a factory – Statement ofanother brother of the deceased was that he and his son werereceiving threatening calls from accused-NM, accused-LM andtheir associates and that these accused were responsible for murderof deceased – NM, LM and accused-Advocate-RS were arrestedwhen they were travelling in a car and black photo frame, blackcap, black goggles and a photo of the deceased were recoveredfrom the car – NM got the Getz car recovered from the house inhis village, in which the contract killer – JSS allegedly travelledto the site of occurrence to murder the deceased – The unlicensedpistol along with two live cartridges were recovered from the officeof accused-SS – During investigation, the Call Detail Records ofthe accused were collected by the Investigating Officer – As perthe version of the prosecution, NM had asked his cousin brotherLM to carry out the murder – Af ter initial ly agreeing, LMsubsequently backed out – Thereafter, JSS was asked to executethe murder – F.S.L Report recorded that the lead recovered fromthe body of the deceased was fired from the pistol recovered fromthe office of SS – As per the report of the handwriting expert, thespecimen handwriting of JSS matched the writing on the envelopewhich allegedly was carried by JSS to the house of the deceased– NM borrowed a car, unlicenced pistol with five cartridges and took JSS to the place of occurrence and waited in the car for JSSwhile he went to murder the deceased and then helped JSS to getaway – NM was in continuous contact with accused-SB before andafter the incident – The records of the committees run by SCB wereallegedly destroyed by him – This would a strong suspicion aboutthe conduct of SCB – The destruction of the records of thecommittees, which would have revealed the substantial investmentsmade by the deceased was an incriminating factor – Thecircumstance of absconding of accused immediately after themurder would be also admissible as relevant ‘conduct’ under s.8of the Evidence Act – The contemporaneous Call Detail Records(CDRs) between SB and NM, who accompanied JSS would alsoconstitute strong material for framing the charge against all theaccused – Charge Sheet was filed against all the accused –Sessions Court held that there was common intention between NMand JSS in the act of killing the deceased – However LM wasdischarged as there was not sufficient evidence to connect him withthe crime – With respect to RS, it was held that evidence was notsufficient to frame charges against him as he had only tenderedadvice to NM to the effect that he should not use his licensed pistolfor carrying out the murder – With respect to SS, the Sessions Courtheld that the unlicensed pistol along with two live cartridges wererecovered from his office and charged him only for the offence u/S. 25 of the Arms Act for keeping an unlicensed firearm in hispossession – Sessions Court discharged SCB since the prosecutionhad collected evidence against him only in the form of disclosurestatements from the accused persons after arrest – Sessions Courtcharged SB for the offence u/S. 25 of the Arms Act, since he gotthe licensed pistol belonging to NM recovered from his factorypremises – Sessions Court held that the prosecution failed to makeout a prima facie case against RS, LM, SCB who were discharged– The State and the complainant filed Revision before the HighCourt – High Court held that NM, SB, JSS were to be charged u/s.302 read with s.34 IPC read with 120B IPC – The Judgment ofthe Sessions Court ordering discharge of SCB, SS, LM, RS wasaffirmed by the High Court – Hence the instant appeal by the Stateand the complainant – Held: The present case is one where theprosecution has alleged that there was a criminal conspiracy tomurder the deceased by all the accused – The crime was not committed at the spur of the moment, but was preceded bymeticulous planning where each of the accused played a separaterole to achieve the common illegal object of carrying out themurder of the deceased – The manner and circumstances in whichthe offence was committed, and the level of involvement of theaccused persons were relevant factors – Each conspirator playedhis separate part in one integrated and united effort to achievethe common purpose – Each one was aware that he has a part toplay in the general conspiracy, to accomplish the common object– Conspiracy is mostly proved by circumstantial evidence by takinginto account the cumulative effect of the circumstances indicatingthe guilt of the accused, rather than adopting an approach byisolating the role played by each of the accused – The acts orconduct of the parties must be conscious and clear enough to infertheir concurrence as to the common design and its execution – Incases of criminal conspiracy, better evidence than acts andstatements of co-conspirators is hardly ever available – There wasample material brought on record which created a grave suspicionabout the involvement of SCB, LM, SS in the murder of the deceased– Accordingly, Sessions Court is directed to frame charges againstSCB under s.302 r/w s.34 IPC and s.120B and s.201; LM unders.302 r/w s.34 and s.120B; and against SS under s.302 r/w s.34and s.120B and ss.25, 27, 54 and 59 of Arms Act – Penal Code,1860 – s.302 r/w s.34.Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973: ss.227, 228 – Scope of– Held: The Court while considering the question of framingcharges under s.227 has the power to sift and weigh the evidencefor the limited purpose of finding out whether or not a prima faciecase has been made out against the accused – If the materialplaced before the court discloses grave suspicion against theaccused, which has not been properly explained, the court will befully justified in framing charges and proceeding with the trial –At this stage, there cannot be a roving enquiry into the pros andcons of the matter, the evidence is not to be weighed as if a trial isbeing conducted.Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973: ss.223, 386, 391 – Held:s.223 provides that persons accused of the same offence, committedin the course of the same transaction, must be jointly charged andtried – In the instant case, on account of the inconsistency in framing charges by the Sessions Court against the six accused, thetrial got truncated – The trial with respect to three accused i.e. SB,NM and JSS proceeded in

        "HeadNote": "Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973: s.227 – Appeal by Stateand complainant against the discharge of accused persons –Prosecution case was that the victim-deceased was murdered in hishouse – The alleged contract killer came as a courier boy wearingblack cap and goggles – The wife of the complainant identifiedhim in investigation – As per the version of son/nephew andbrothers of the deceased, the deceased had invested a substantialamount of money in committees run by accused-SCB and his sonaccused-SB which they were reluctant to return and were alsotrying to usurp share of the deceased in a factory – Statement ofanother brother of the deceased was that he and his son werereceiving threatening calls from accused-NM, accused-LM andtheir associates and that these accused were responsible for murderof deceased – NM, LM and accused-Advocate-RS were arrestedwhen they were travelling in a car and black photo frame, blackcap, black goggles and a photo of the deceased were recoveredfrom the car – NM got the Getz car recovered from the house inhis village, in which the contract killer – JSS allegedly travelledto the site of occurrence to murder the deceased – The unlicensedpistol along with two live cartridges were recovered from the officeof accused-SS – During investigation, the Call Detail Records ofthe accused were collected by the Investigating Officer – As perthe version of the prosecution, NM had asked his cousin brotherLM to carry out the murder – Af ter initial ly agreeing, LMsubsequently backed out – Thereafter, JSS was asked to executethe murder – F.S.L Report recorded that the lead recovered fromthe body of the deceased was fired from the pistol recovered fromthe office of SS – As per the report of the handwriting expert, thespecimen handwriting of JSS matched the writing on the envelopewhich allegedly was carried by JSS to the house of the deceased– NM borrowed a car, unlicenced pistol with five cartridges and took JSS to the place of occurrence and waited in the car for JSSwhile he went to murder the deceased and then helped JSS to getaway – NM was in continuous contact with accused-SB before andafter the incident – The records of the committees run by SCB wereallegedly destroyed by him – This would a strong suspicion aboutthe conduct of SCB – The destruction of the records of thecommittees, which would have revealed the substantial investmentsmade by the deceased was an incriminating factor – Thecircumstance of absconding of accused immediately after themurder would be also admissible as relevant ‘conduct’ under s.8of the Evidence Act – The contemporaneous Call Detail Records(CDRs) between SB and NM, who accompanied JSS would alsoconstitute strong material for framing the charge against all theaccused – Charge Sheet was filed against all the accused –Sessions Court held that there was common intention between NMand JSS in the act of killing the deceased – However LM wasdischarged as there was not sufficient evidence to connect him withthe crime – With respect to RS, it was held that evidence was notsufficient to frame charges against him as he had only tenderedadvice to NM to the effect that he should not use his licensed pistolfor carrying out the murder – With respect to SS, the Sessions Courtheld that the unlicensed pistol along with two live cartridges wererecovered from his office and charged him only for the offence u/S. 25 of the Arms Act for keeping an unlicensed firearm in hispossession – Sessions Court discharged SCB since the prosecutionhad collected evidence against him only in the form of disclosurestatements from the accused persons after arrest – Sessions Courtcharged SB for the offence u/S. 25 of the Arms Act, since he gotthe licensed pistol belonging to NM recovered from his factorypremises – Sessions Court held that the prosecution failed to makeout a prima facie case against RS, LM, SCB who were discharged– The State and the complainant filed Revision before the HighCourt – High Court held that NM, SB, JSS were to be charged u/s.302 read with s.34 IPC read with 120B IPC – The Judgment ofthe Sessions Court ordering discharge of SCB, SS, LM, RS wasaffirmed by the High Court – Hence the instant appeal by the Stateand the complainant – Held: The present case is one where theprosecution has alleged that there was a criminal conspiracy tomurder the deceased by all the accused – The crime was not committed at the spur of the moment, but was preceded bymeticulous planning where each of the accused played a separaterole to achieve the common illegal object of carrying out themurder of the deceased – The manner and circumstances in whichthe offence was committed, and the level of involvement of theaccused persons were relevant factors – Each conspirator playedhis separate part in one integrated and united effort to achievethe common purpose – Each one was aware that he has a part toplay in the general conspiracy, to accomplish the common object– Conspiracy is mostly proved by circumstantial evidence by takinginto account the cumulative effect of the circumstances indicatingthe guilt of the accused, rather than adopting an approach byisolating the role played by each of the accused – The acts orconduct of the parties must be conscious and clear enough to infertheir concurrence as to the common design and its execution – Incases of criminal conspiracy, better evidence than acts andstatements of co-conspirators is hardly ever available – There wasample material brought on record which created a grave suspicionabout the involvement of SCB, LM, SS in the murder of the deceased– Accordingly, Sessions Court is directed to frame charges againstSCB under s.302 r/w s.34 IPC and s.120B and s.201; LM unders.302 r/w s.34 and s.120B; and against SS under s.302 r/w s.34and s.120B and ss.25, 27, 54 and 59 of Arms Act – Penal Code,1860 – s.302 r/w s.34.Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973: ss.227, 228 – Scope of– Held: The Court while considering the question of framingcharges under s.227 has the power to sift and weigh the evidencefor the limited purpose of finding out whether or not a prima faciecase has been made out against the accused – If the materialplaced before the court discloses grave suspicion against theaccused, which has not been properly explained, the court will befully justified in framing charges and proceeding with the trial –At this stage, there cannot be a roving enquiry into the pros andcons of the matter, the evidence is not to be weighed as if a trial isbeing conducted.Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973: ss.223, 386, 391 – Held:s.223 provides that persons accused of the same offence, committedin the course of the same transaction, must be jointly charged andtried – In the instant case, on account of the inconsistency in framing charges by the Sessions Court against the six accused, thetrial got truncated – The trial with respect to three accused i.e. SB,NM and JSS proceeded in the absence of the other three accusedviz. SCB, LM and SS – This was a case of criminal conspiracybased on circumstantial evidence – Since the trial in the instantcase got truncated, it is necessary that the trial of the remainingthree accused proceeds forthwith in accordance with law – Withrespect to the other three accused i.e. SB, NM and JSS the trialwas conducted in the absence of the other three alleged co-conspirators– The order of acquittal with respect to SB and NMis pending before the High Court – s.386 defines the powers ofthe appellate court in dealing with appeals – Under clause (a) ofs.386, the High Court may reverse the order of acquittal and directthat further enquiry be made, or the accused may be re-tried, ormay find him guilty and pass sentence thereon – As an appellateCourt, the High Court may take further evidence while consideringthe appeals under s.391, if it is considered necessary, and takeadditional evidence on record. The High Court may also permitrecording of statements under s.313 if considered necessary – HighCourt may take up the pending appeals in the case of SB, NM andJSS, after the conclusion of the trial of SCB, LM and SS, theremaining accused by the Sessions Court in this case",

Onlya redacted portion of the report was placed before the Parliamentand in public domain” should be replaced by: “ The Governmenthas already shared the pricing details with the CAG. The report ofthe CAG is examined by the PAC in the usual course of business.Only a redacted version of the report is placed before theParliament and in Public domain”.Rafale Fighter Jets Case – Judgment – Review of – It wascontended by the petitioner that in writ petition a prayer was madefor registration of an FIR and investigation by the CBI, which wasnot dealt with and the contract was reviewed prematurely by theJudiciary without the benefit of investigation and inquiry into thedisputed questions of facts – Held (Per Sanjay Kishan Kaul, J.for himself and Ranjan Gogoi, CJI.) : Not a fair submission forthe reason that all counsels, including counsel representing thepetitioners in this matter addressed elaborate submissions on all the aspects – There was a prayer for registration of F.I.R andfurther investigation but then once all the aspects were examinedon merits, the Supreme Court did not consider it appropriate to issueany directions.Rafale Fighter Jets Case – Judgment – Review of – Pricingof the Jets – Held (Per Sanjay Kishan Kaul, J. for himself andRanjan Gogoi, CJI.) : It is not the function of the Supreme Courtto determine the prices nor for that matter can such aspects bedealt with on mere suspicion of persons who decide to approachthe Court – The internal mechanism of such pricing would takecare of the situation – The pricing of the basic aircraft had to becompared which was competitively marginally lower – As to whatshould be loaded on the aircraft or not and what further pricingshould be added has to be left to the best judgment of thecompetent authorities.Rafale Fighter Jets Case – Judgment – Review of – ContemptPetition – The contempt petition emanates from an allegationagainst the then President of the Indian National Congress onaccount of utterances made in the presence of several mediapersons that the Supreme Court was in consonance with what hisdiscourse was, i.e. that the prime Minister of India stole money fromthe Air Force and give it to a particular business group and PrimeMinister had indulged in corruption – Held (Sanjay Kishan Kaul,J. for himself and Ranjan Gogoi, CJI.): The matter wascompounded by filing a 20 page affidavit with a large number ofdocuments annexed rather than simply accepting the mistake andgiving an unconditional apology – However, a subsequent affidavitwas filed on 08.05.2019 with better wisdom – In view of thesubsequent affidavit, better sense having prevailed – The ContemptProceedings are closed with a word of caution for the contemnorto be more careful in future.Rafale Fighter Jets Case – Judgment – Review of – Thecomplaint is that the Supreme Court totally overlooked the reliefsought in Writ Petition (Criminal) No. 298 of 2018 – In the saidwrit petition, the petitioner had sought registration of an F.I.R. andinvestigation of the offences disclosed – The petitioners in the saidcase, premise their case on the judgment of the Supreme Court in Lalita Kumari v. Government of Uttar Pradesh and others – It iscontended that error is apparent in not even considering the impactof the Constitution Bench and requires to be redressed through theReview Petition – Held (Per K.M. Joseph, J.(concurring)) : Thefour writ petitions were heard together, the Court had proceededto focus on the merits of the matter itself undoubtedly from the standpoint of the limited judicial review which it could undertake in amatter of the nature in question – On basis of the said exercise,the Court has concluded that there were no materials for the Courtto interfere – But this is a far cry from holding that it will not followthe mandate of the Constitution bench of the Supreme Court inregard to the steps to be undertaken by the officer on receipt of acomplaint purporting to make out the commission of a cognizableoffence – The Supreme Court may declare that it was non-suitingthe petitioners seeking judicial review, having regard to the absenceof materials which would have justified holding the award of thecontract in question vulnerable – It would not mean it is eitherprecluded or that it was not duty-bound to still direct that the lawlaid down by the Constitution bench in Lalita Kumari be conformedto – Also, the Constitution Bench in Lalita Kumari had consideredthe necessity for preliminary inquiry in of fences relating tocorruption – Therefore, the petitioners may not be justified inapproaching the Supreme Court seeking the relief of registrationof an F.I.R. and investigation on the same as such – This for thereason as there were allegations of corruption and the petitionerhad not sought relief of a preliminary inquiry – Furthermore, thepetitioners had filed complaint fully knowing that s. 17A of thePrevention of Corruption (Amendment) Act, 2018 constituted a barto any inquiry or enquiry or investigation unless there was previousapproval – The petitioners had requested approval u/s. 17A in thecomplaint but the same relief was not sought in the writ petition –Even proceeding on the basis that on petitioners’ complaint, an FIRmust be registered as it purports to disclose cognizable offencesand the Court must so direct, it will be a futile exercise havingregard to s.17A – In the instant case, the petitioners cannot succeedin the Review petition – However, the judgment sought to bereviewed, would not stand in the way of the first respondent-CBIfrom taking action on the complaint in accordance with law andsubject to obtaining previous approval u/s. 17A of the Act, 2018 Constitution of India – Art.137 – Review – Jurisdiction in –Held (Per K.M. Joseph, J. (concurring)): The principle well-settledin regard to jurisdiction in review, is that a review is not an appealin disguise – The applicant, in a review, is, on most occasions, toldoff the gates, by pointing out that his remedy lay in pursuing anappeal – In the case of a decision rendered by the Supreme Court,it is to be noticed that the underpinning based on availability ofan appeal, is not available as the Supreme Court is the final Courtand no appeal l ies – While a review petit ion has not beenunderstood as an appeal in disguise and a mere erroneous decisionmay not justify a review, a decision which betrays an error whichis apparent, does entitle the Court to exercise its jurisdiction u/Art.137 of the Constitution.Constitution of India – Art.137 – Code of Civil Procedure,1908 – Or. XLVII, r.1 – Review – Maintainability of – Held (PerK.M. Joseph, J.(concurring)): A Review Petition is maintainableif the impugned judgment of the Supreme Court discloses an errorapparent on the face of the record – For granting review u/Art.137 of the Constitution r/w. Or. XLVII, r.1 of the C.P.C., the errorcan be an error of fact or of law – Error has been described as apalpable error or glaring omission – As to what constitutes anerror apparent on the face of record, is a matter to be found incontext of the facts of each case.Police – Police officer – Power of – Power of police officerwider and different from that of writ Court – Held (Per K.M.Joseph, J.(concurring)): In the instant case, the CBI is the premierinvestigation agency of the country – It is equipped to undertakeall forms of investigations, be it technical or otherwise – TheSupreme Court held in the writ petitions filed before this ReviewPetitions, that it is neither appropriate nor with the Court’sexperience to step into what is technically feasible or not – No suchlimitation applies to an investigator of a cognizable offence – Whatis important is that it is the duty of the investigating officer to collectall material, be it technical or otherwise and thereafter, submit anappropriate report to the Court concerned, be it a final report orchallan depending upon the materials unearthed – The Court hadrelied on absence of the substantial materials – However, this isnot the restriction on the Investigating Officer",

Onlya redacted portion of the report was placed before the Parliamentand in public domain” should be replaced by: “ The Governmenthas already shared the pricing details with the CAG. The report ofthe CAG is examined by the PAC in the usual course of business.Only a redacted version of the report is placed before theParliament and in Public domain”.Rafale Fighter Jets Case – Judgment – Review of – It wascontended by the petitioner that in writ petition a prayer was madefor registration of an FIR and investigation by the CBI, which wasnot dealt with and the contract was reviewed prematurely by theJudiciary without the benefit of investigation and inquiry into thedisputed questions of facts – Held (Per Sanjay Kishan Kaul, J.for himself and Ranjan Gogoi, CJI.) : Not a fair submission forthe reason that all counsels, including counsel representing thepetitioners in this matter addressed elaborate submissions on all the aspects – There was a prayer for registration of F.I.R andfurther investigation but then once all the aspects were examinedon merits, the Supreme Court did not consider it appropriate to issueany directions.Rafale Fighter Jets Case – Judgment – Review of – Pricingof the Jets – Held (Per Sanjay Kishan Kaul, J. for himself andRanjan Gogoi, CJI.) : It is not the function of the Supreme Courtto determine the prices nor for that matter can such aspects bedealt with on mere suspicion of persons who decide to approachthe Court – The internal mechanism of such pricing would takecare of the situation – The pricing of the basic aircraft had to becompared which was competitively marginally lower – As to whatshould be loaded on the aircraft or not and what further pricingshould be added has to be left to the best judgment of thecompetent authorities.Rafale Fighter Jets Case – Judgment – Review of – ContemptPetition – The contempt petition emanates from an allegationagainst the then President of the Indian National Congress onaccount of utterances made in the presence of several mediapersons that the Supreme Court was in consonance with what hisdiscourse was, i.e. that the prime Minister of India stole money fromthe Air Force and give it to a particular business group and PrimeMinister had indulged in corruption – Held (Sanjay Kishan Kaul,J. for himself and Ranjan Gogoi, CJI.): The matter wascompounded by filing a 20 page affidavit with a large number ofdocuments annexed rather than simply accepting the mistake andgiving an unconditional apology – However, a subsequent affidavitwas filed on 08.05.2019 with better wisdom – In view of thesubsequent affidavit, better sense having prevailed – The ContemptProceedings are closed with a word of caution for the contemnorto be more careful in future.Rafale Fighter Jets Case – Judgment – Review of – Thecomplaint is that the Supreme Court totally overlooked the reliefsought in Writ Petition (Criminal) No. 298 of 2018 – In the saidwrit petition, the petitioner had sought registration of an F.I.R. andinvestigation of the offences disclosed – The petitioners in the saidcase, premise their case on the judgment of the Supreme Court in Lalita Kumari v. Government of Uttar Pradesh and others – It iscontended that error is apparent in not even considering the impactof the Constitution Bench and requires to be redressed through theReview Petition – Held (Per K.M. Joseph, J.(concurring)) : Thefour writ petitions were heard together, the Court had proceededto focus on the merits of the matter itself undoubtedly from the standpoint of the limited judicial review which it could undertake in amatter of the nature in question – On basis of the said exercise,the Court has concluded that there were no materials for the Courtto interfere – But this is a far cry from holding that it will not followthe mandate of the Constitution bench of the Supreme Court inregard to the steps to be undertaken by the officer on receipt of acomplaint purporting to make out the commission of a cognizableoffence – The Supreme Court may declare that it was non-suitingthe petitioners seeking judicial review, having regard to the absenceof materials which would have justified holding the award of thecontract in question vulnerable – It would not mean it is eitherprecluded or that it was not duty-bound to still direct that the lawlaid down by the Constitution bench in Lalita Kumari be conformedto – Also, the Constitution Bench in Lalita Kumari had consideredthe necessity for preliminary inquiry in of fences relating tocorruption – Therefore, the petitioners may not be justified inapproaching the Supreme Court seeking the relief of registrationof an F.I.R. and investigation on the same as such – This for thereason as there were allegations of corruption and the petitionerhad not sought relief of a preliminary inquiry – Furthermore, thepetitioners had filed complaint fully knowing that s. 17A of thePrevention of Corruption (Amendment) Act, 2018 constituted a barto any inquiry or enquiry or investigation unless there was previousapproval – The petitioners had requested approval u/s. 17A in thecomplaint but the same relief was not sought in the writ petition –Even proceeding on the basis that on petitioners’ complaint, an FIRmust be registered as it purports to disclose cognizable offencesand the Court must so direct, it will be a futile exercise havingregard to s.17A – In the instant case, the petitioners cannot succeedin the Review petition – However, the judgment sought to bereviewed, would not stand in the way of the first respondent-CBIfrom taking action on the complaint in accordance with law andsubject to obtaining previous approval u/s. 17A of the Act, 2018 Constitution of India – Art.137 – Review – Jurisdiction in –Held (Per K.M. Joseph, J. (concurring)): The principle well-settledin regard to jurisdiction in review, is that a review is not an appealin disguise – The applicant, in a review, is, on most occasions, toldoff the gates, by pointing out that his remedy lay in pursuing anappeal – In the case of a decision rendered by the Supreme Court,it is to be noticed that the underpinning based on availability ofan appeal, is not available as the Supreme Court is the final Courtand no appeal l ies – While a review petit ion has not beenunderstood as an appeal in disguise and a mere erroneous decisionmay not justify a review, a decision which betrays an error whichis apparent, does entitle the Court to exercise its jurisdiction u/Art.137 of the Constitution.Constitution of India – Art.137 – Code of Civil Procedure,1908 – Or. XLVII, r.1 – Review – Maintainability of – Held (PerK.M. Joseph, J.(concurring)): A Review Petition is maintainableif the impugned judgment of the Supreme Court discloses an errorapparent on the face of the record – For granting review u/Art.137 of the Constitution r/w. Or. XLVII, r.1 of the C.P.C., the errorcan be an error of fact or of law – Error has been described as apalpable error or glaring omission – As to what constitutes anerror apparent on the face of record, is a matter to be found incontext of the facts of each case.Police – Police officer – Power of – Power of police officerwider and different from that of writ Court – Held (Per K.M.Joseph, J.(concurring)): In the instant case, the CBI is the premierinvestigation agency of the country – It is equipped to undertakeall forms of investigations, be it technical or otherwise – TheSupreme Court held in the writ petitions filed before this ReviewPetitions, that it is neither appropriate nor with the Court’sexperience to step into what is technically feasible or not – No suchlimitation applies to an investigator of a cognizable offence – Whatis important is that it is the duty of the investigating officer to collectall material, be it technical or otherwise and thereafter, submit anappropriate report to the Court concerned, be it a final report orchallan depending upon the materials unearthed – The Court hadrelied on absence of the substantial materials – However, this isnot the restriction on the Investigating Officer",

Onlya redacted portion of the report was placed before the Parliamentand in public domain” should be replaced by: “ The Governmenthas already shared the pricing details with the CAG. The report ofthe CAG is examined by the PAC in the usual course of business.Only a redacted version of the report is placed before theParliament and in Public domain”.Rafale Fighter Jets Case – Judgment – Review of – It wascontended by the petitioner that in writ petition a prayer was madefor registration of an FIR and investigation by the CBI, which wasnot dealt with and the contract was reviewed prematurely by theJudiciary without the benefit of investigation and inquiry into thedisputed questions of facts – Held (Per Sanjay Kishan Kaul, J.for himself and Ranjan Gogoi, CJI.) : Not a fair submission forthe reason that all counsels, including counsel representing thepetitioners in this matter addressed elaborate submissions on all the aspects – There was a prayer for registration of F.I.R andfurther investigation but then once all the aspects were examinedon merits, the Supreme Court did not consider it appropriate to issueany directions.Rafale Fighter Jets Case – Judgment – Review of – Pricingof the Jets – Held (Per Sanjay Kishan Kaul, J. for himself andRanjan Gogoi, CJI.) : It is not the function of the Supreme Courtto determine the prices nor for that matter can such aspects bedealt with on mere suspicion of persons who decide to approachthe Court – The internal mechanism of such pricing would takecare of the situation – The pricing of the basic aircraft had to becompared which was competitively marginally lower – As to whatshould be loaded on the aircraft or not and what further pricingshould be added has to be left to the best judgment of thecompetent authorities.Rafale Fighter Jets Case – Judgment – Review of – ContemptPetition – The contempt petition emanates from an allegationagainst the then President of the Indian National Congress onaccount of utterances made in the presence of several mediapersons that the Supreme Court was in consonance with what hisdiscourse was, i.e. that the prime Minister of India stole money fromthe Air Force and give it to a particular business group and PrimeMinister had indulged in corruption – Held (Sanjay Kishan Kaul,J. for himself and Ranjan Gogoi, CJI.): The matter wascompounded by filing a 20 page affidavit with a large number ofdocuments annexed rather than simply accepting the mistake andgiving an unconditional apology – However, a subsequent affidavitwas filed on 08.05.2019 with better wisdom – In view of thesubsequent affidavit, better sense having prevailed – The ContemptProceedings are closed with a word of caution for the contemnorto be more careful in future.Rafale Fighter Jets Case – Judgment – Review of – Thecomplaint is that the Supreme Court totally overlooked the reliefsought in Writ Petition (Criminal) No. 298 of 2018 – In the saidwrit petition, the petitioner had sought registration of an F.I.R. andinvestigation of the offences disclosed – The petitioners in the saidcase, premise their case on the judgment of the Supreme Court in Lalita Kumari v. Government of Uttar Pradesh and others – It iscontended that error is apparent in not even considering the impactof the Constitution Bench and requires to be redressed through theReview Petition – Held (Per K.M. Joseph, J.(concurring)) : Thefour writ petitions were heard together, the Court had proceededto focus on the merits of the matter itself undoubtedly from the standpoint of the limited judicial review which it could undertake in amatter of the nature in question – On basis of the said exercise,the Court has concluded that there were no materials for the Courtto interfere – But this is a far cry from holding that it will not followthe mandate of the Constitution bench of the Supreme Court inregard to the steps to be undertaken by the officer on receipt of acomplaint purporting to make out the commission of a cognizableoffence – The Supreme Court may declare that it was non-suitingthe petitioners seeking judicial review, having regard to the absenceof materials which would have justified holding the award of thecontract in question vulnerable – It would not mean it is eitherprecluded or that it was not duty-bound to still direct that the lawlaid down by the Constitution bench in Lalita Kumari be conformedto – Also, the Constitution Bench in Lalita Kumari had consideredthe necessity for preliminary inquiry in of fences relating tocorruption – Therefore, the petitioners may not be justified inapproaching the Supreme Court seeking the relief of registrationof an F.I.R. and investigation on the same as such – This for thereason as there were allegations of corruption and the petitionerhad not sought relief of a preliminary inquiry – Furthermore, thepetitioners had filed complaint fully knowing that s. 17A of thePrevention of Corruption (Amendment) Act, 2018 constituted a barto any inquiry or enquiry or investigation unless there was previousapproval – The petitioners had requested approval u/s. 17A in thecomplaint but the same relief was not sought in the writ petition –Even proceeding on the basis that on petitioners’ complaint, an FIRmust be registered as it purports to disclose cognizable offencesand the Court must so direct, it will be a futile exercise havingregard to s.17A – In the instant case, the petitioners cannot succeedin the Review petition – However, the judgment sought to bereviewed, would not stand in the way of the first respondent-CBIfrom taking action on the complaint in accordance with law andsubject to obtaining previous approval u/s. 17A of the Act, 2018 Constitution of India – Art.137 – Review – Jurisdiction in –Held (Per K.M. Joseph, J. (concurring)): The principle well-settledin regard to jurisdiction in review, is that a review is not an appealin disguise – The applicant, in a review, is, on most occasions, toldoff the gates, by pointing out that his remedy lay in pursuing anappeal – In the case of a decision rendered by the Supreme Court,it is to be noticed that the underpinning based on availability ofan appeal, is not available as the Supreme Court is the final Courtand no appeal l ies – While a review petit ion has not beenunderstood as an appeal in disguise and a mere erroneous decisionmay not justify a review, a decision which betrays an error whichis apparent, does entitle the Court to exercise its jurisdiction u/Art.137 of the Constitution.Constitution of India – Art.137 – Code of Civil Procedure,1908 – Or. XLVII, r.1 – Review – Maintainability of – Held (PerK.M. Joseph, J.(concurring)): A Review Petition is maintainableif the impugned judgment of the Supreme Court discloses an errorapparent on the face of the record – For granting review u/Art.137 of the Constitution r/w. Or. XLVII, r.1 of the C.P.C., the errorcan be an error of fact or of law – Error has been described as apalpable error or glaring omission – As to what constitutes anerror apparent on the face of record, is a matter to be found incontext of the facts of each case.Police – Police officer – Power of – Power of police officerwider and different from that of writ Court – Held (Per K.M.Joseph, J.(concurring)): In the instant case, the CBI is the premierinvestigation agency of the country – It is equipped to undertakeall forms of investigations, be it technical or otherwise – TheSupreme Court held in the writ petitions filed before this ReviewPetitions, that it is neither appropriate nor with the Court’sexperience to step into what is technically feasible or not – No suchlimitation applies to an investigator of a cognizable offence – Whatis important is that it is the duty of the investigating officer to collectall material, be it technical or otherwise and thereafter, submit anappropriate report to the Court concerned, be it a final report orchallan depending upon the materials unearthed – The Court hadrelied on absence of the substantial materials – However, this isnot the restriction on the Investigating Officer",

Onlya redacted portion of the report was placed before the Parliamentand in public domain” should be replaced by: “ The Governmenthas already shared the pricing details with the CAG. The report ofthe CAG is examined by the PAC in the usual course of business.Only a redacted version of the report is placed before theParliament and in Public domain”.Rafale Fighter Jets Case – Judgment – Review of – It wascontended by the petitioner that in writ petition a prayer was madefor registration of an FIR and investigation by the CBI, which wasnot dealt with and the contract was reviewed prematurely by theJudiciary without the benefit of investigation and inquiry into thedisputed questions of facts – Held (Per Sanjay Kishan Kaul, J.for himself and Ranjan Gogoi, CJI.) : Not a fair submission forthe reason that all counsels, including counsel representing thepetitioners in this matter addressed elaborate submissions on all the aspects – There was a prayer for registration of F.I.R andfurther investigation but then once all the aspects were examinedon merits, the Supreme Court did not consider it appropriate to issueany directions.Rafale Fighter Jets Case – Judgment – Review of – Pricingof the Jets – Held (Per Sanjay Kishan Kaul, J. for himself andRanjan Gogoi, CJI.) : It is not the function of the Supreme Courtto determine the prices nor for that matter can such aspects bedealt with on mere suspicion of persons who decide to approachthe Court – The internal mechanism of such pricing would takecare of the situation – The pricing of the basic aircraft had to becompared which was competitively marginally lower – As to whatshould be loaded on the aircraft or not and what further pricingshould be added has to be left to the best judgment of thecompetent authorities.Rafale Fighter Jets Case – Judgment – Review of – ContemptPetition – The contempt petition emanates from an allegationagainst the then President of the Indian National Congress onaccount of utterances made in the presence of several mediapersons that the Supreme Court was in consonance with what hisdiscourse was, i.e. that the prime Minister of India stole money fromthe Air Force and give it to a particular business group and PrimeMinister had indulged in corruption – Held (Sanjay Kishan Kaul,J. for himself and Ranjan Gogoi, CJI.): The matter wascompounded by filing a 20 page affidavit with a large number ofdocuments annexed rather than simply accepting the mistake andgiving an unconditional apology – However, a subsequent affidavitwas filed on 08.05.2019 with better wisdom – In view of thesubsequent affidavit, better sense having prevailed – The ContemptProceedings are closed with a word of caution for the contemnorto be more careful in future.Rafale Fighter Jets Case – Judgment – Review of – Thecomplaint is that the Supreme Court totally overlooked the reliefsought in Writ Petition (Criminal) No. 298 of 2018 – In the saidwrit petition, the petitioner had sought registration of an F.I.R. andinvestigation of the offences disclosed – The petitioners in the saidcase, premise their case on the judgment of the Supreme Court in Lalita Kumari v. Government of Uttar Pradesh and others – It iscontended that error is apparent in not even considering the impactof the Constitution Bench and requires to be redressed through theReview Petition – Held (Per K.M. Joseph, J.(concurring)) : Thefour writ petitions were heard together, the Court had proceededto focus on the merits of the matter itself undoubtedly from the standpoint of the limited judicial review which it could undertake in amatter of the nature in question – On basis of the said exercise,the Court has concluded that there were no materials for the Courtto interfere – But this is a far cry from holding that it will not followthe mandate of the Constitution bench of the Supreme Court inregard to the steps to be undertaken by the officer on receipt of acomplaint purporting to make out the commission of a cognizableoffence – The Supreme Court may declare that it was non-suitingthe petitioners seeking judicial review, having regard to the absenceof materials which would have justified holding the award of thecontract in question vulnerable – It would not mean it is eitherprecluded or that it was not duty-bound to still direct that the lawlaid down by the Constitution bench in Lalita Kumari be conformedto – Also, the Constitution Bench in Lalita Kumari had consideredthe necessity for preliminary inquiry in of fences relating tocorruption – Therefore, the petitioners may not be justified inapproaching the Supreme Court seeking the relief of registrationof an F.I.R. and investigation on the same as such – This for thereason as there were allegations of corruption and the petitionerhad not sought relief of a preliminary inquiry – Furthermore, thepetitioners had filed complaint fully knowing that s. 17A of thePrevention of Corruption (Amendment) Act, 2018 constituted a barto any inquiry or enquiry or investigation unless there was previousapproval – The petitioners had requested approval u/s. 17A in thecomplaint but the same relief was not sought in the writ petition –Even proceeding on the basis that on petitioners’ complaint, an FIRmust be registered as it purports to disclose cognizable offencesand the Court must so direct, it will be a futile exercise havingregard to s.17A – In the instant case, the petitioners cannot succeedin the Review petition – However, the judgment sought to bereviewed, would not stand in the way of the first respondent-CBIfrom taking action on the complaint in accordance with law andsubject to obtaining previous approval u/s. 17A of the Act, 2018 Constitution of India – Art.137 – Review – Jurisdiction in –Held (Per K.M. Joseph, J. (concurring)): The principle well-settledin regard to jurisdiction in review, is that a review is not an appealin disguise – The applicant, in a review, is, on most occasions, toldoff the gates, by pointing out that his remedy lay in pursuing anappeal – In the case of a decision rendered by the Supreme Court,it is to be noticed that the underpinning based on availability ofan appeal, is not available as the Supreme Court is the final Courtand no appeal l ies – While a review petit ion has not beenunderstood as an appeal in disguise and a mere erroneous decisionmay not justify a review, a decision which betrays an error whichis apparent, does entitle the Court to exercise its jurisdiction u/Art.137 of the Constitution.Constitution of India – Art.137 – Code of Civil Procedure,1908 – Or. XLVII, r.1 – Review – Maintainability of – Held (PerK.M. Joseph, J.(concurring)): A Review Petition is maintainableif the impugned judgment of the Supreme Court discloses an errorapparent on the face of the record – For granting review u/Art.137 of the Constitution r/w. Or. XLVII, r.1 of the C.P.C., the errorcan be an error of fact or of law – Error has been described as apalpable error or glaring omission – As to what constitutes anerror apparent on the face of record, is a matter to be found incontext of the facts of each case.Police – Police officer – Power of – Power of police officerwider and different from that of writ Court – Held (Per K.M.Joseph, J.(concurring)): In the instant case, the CBI is the premierinvestigation agency of the country – It is equipped to undertakeall forms of investigations, be it technical or otherwise – TheSupreme Court held in the writ petitions filed before this ReviewPetitions, that it is neither appropriate nor with the Court’sexperience to step into what is technically feasible or not – No suchlimitation applies to an investigator of a cognizable offence – Whatis important is that it is the duty of the investigating officer to collectall material, be it technical or otherwise and thereafter, submit anappropriate report to the Court concerned, be it a final report orchallan depending upon the materials unearthed – The Court hadrelied on absence of the substantial materials – However, this isnot the restriction on the Investigating Officer",

Onlya redacted portion of the report was placed before the Parliamentand in public domain” should be replaced by: “ The Governmenthas already shared the pricing details with the CAG. The report ofthe CAG is examined by the PAC in the usual course of business.Only a redacted version of the report is placed before theParliament and in Public domain”.Rafale Fighter Jets Case – Judgment – Review of – It wascontended by the petitioner that in writ petition a prayer was madefor registration of an FIR and investigation by the CBI, which wasnot dealt with and the contract was reviewed prematurely by theJudiciary without the benefit of investigation and inquiry into thedisputed questions of facts – Held (Per Sanjay Kishan Kaul, J.for himself and Ranjan Gogoi, CJI.) : Not a fair submission forthe reason that all counsels, including counsel representing thepetitioners in this matter addressed elaborate submissions on all the aspects – There was a prayer for registration of F.I.R andfurther investigation but then once all the aspects were examinedon merits, the Supreme Court did not consider it appropriate to issueany directions.Rafale Fighter Jets Case – Judgment – Review of – Pricingof the Jets – Held (Per Sanjay Kishan Kaul, J. for himself andRanjan Gogoi, CJI.) : It is not the function of the Supreme Courtto determine the prices nor for that matter can such aspects bedealt with on mere suspicion of persons who decide to approachthe Court – The internal mechanism of such pricing would takecare of the situation – The pricing of the basic aircraft had to becompared which was competitively marginally lower – As to whatshould be loaded on the aircraft or not and what further pricingshould be added has to be left to the best judgment of thecompetent authorities.Rafale Fighter Jets Case – Judgment – Review of – ContemptPetition – The contempt petition emanates from an allegationagainst the then President of the Indian National Congress onaccount of utterances made in the presence of several mediapersons that the Supreme Court was in consonance with what hisdiscourse was, i.e. that the prime Minister of India stole money fromthe Air Force and give it to a particular business group and PrimeMinister had indulged in corruption – Held (Sanjay Kishan Kaul,J. for himself and Ranjan Gogoi, CJI.): The matter wascompounded by filing a 20 page affidavit with a large number ofdocuments annexed rather than simply accepting the mistake andgiving an unconditional apology – However, a subsequent affidavitwas filed on 08.05.2019 with better wisdom – In view of thesubsequent affidavit, better sense having prevailed – The ContemptProceedings are closed with a word of caution for the contemnorto be more careful in future.Rafale Fighter Jets Case – Judgment – Review of – Thecomplaint is that the Supreme Court totally overlooked the reliefsought in Writ Petition (Criminal) No. 298 of 2018 – In the saidwrit petition, the petitioner had sought registration of an F.I.R. andinvestigation of the offences disclosed – The petitioners in the saidcase, premise their case on the judgment of the Supreme Court in Lalita Kumari v. Government of Uttar Pradesh and others – It iscontended that error is apparent in not even considering the impactof the Constitution Bench and requires to be redressed through theReview Petition – Held (Per K.M. Joseph, J.(concurring)) : Thefour writ petitions were heard together, the Court had proceededto focus on the merits of the matter itself undoubtedly from the standpoint of the limited judicial review which it could undertake in amatter of the nature in question – On basis of the said exercise,the Court has concluded that there were no materials for the Courtto interfere – But this is a far cry from holding that it will not followthe mandate of the Constitution bench of the Supreme Court inregard to the steps to be undertaken by the officer on receipt of acomplaint purporting to make out the commission of a cognizableoffence – The Supreme Court may declare that it was non-suitingthe petitioners seeking judicial review, having regard to the absenceof materials which would have justified holding the award of thecontract in question vulnerable – It would not mean it is eitherprecluded or that it was not duty-bound to still direct that the lawlaid down by the Constitution bench in Lalita Kumari be conformedto – Also, the Constitution Bench in Lalita Kumari had consideredthe necessity for preliminary inquiry in of fences relating tocorruption – Therefore, the petitioners may not be justified inapproaching the Supreme Court seeking the relief of registrationof an F.I.R. and investigation on the same as such – This for thereason as there were allegations of corruption and the petitionerhad not sought relief of a preliminary inquiry – Furthermore, thepetitioners had filed complaint fully knowing that s. 17A of thePrevention of Corruption (Amendment) Act, 2018 constituted a barto any inquiry or enquiry or investigation unless there was previousapproval – The petitioners had requested approval u/s. 17A in thecomplaint but the same relief was not sought in the writ petition –Even proceeding on the basis that on petitioners’ complaint, an FIRmust be registered as it purports to disclose cognizable offencesand the Court must so direct, it will be a futile exercise havingregard to s.17A – In the instant case, the petitioners cannot succeedin the Review petition – However, the judgment sought to bereviewed, would not stand in the way of the first respondent-CBIfrom taking action on the complaint in accordance with law andsubject to obtaining previous approval u/s. 17A of the Act, 2018 Constitution of India – Art.137 – Review – Jurisdiction in –Held (Per K.M. Joseph, J. (concurring)): The principle well-settledin regard to jurisdiction in review, is that a review is not an appealin disguise – The applicant, in a review, is, on most occasions, toldoff the gates, by pointing out that his remedy lay in pursuing anappeal – In the case of a decision rendered by the Supreme Court,it is to be noticed that the underpinning based on availability ofan appeal, is not available as the Supreme Court is the final Courtand no appeal l ies – While a review petit ion has not beenunderstood as an appeal in disguise and a mere erroneous decisionmay not justify a review, a decision which betrays an error whichis apparent, does entitle the Court to exercise its jurisdiction u/Art.137 of the Constitution.Constitution of India – Art.137 – Code of Civil Procedure,1908 – Or. XLVII, r.1 – Review – Maintainability of – Held (PerK.M. Joseph, J.(concurring)): A Review Petition is maintainableif the impugned judgment of the Supreme Court discloses an errorapparent on the face of the record – For granting review u/Art.137 of the Constitution r/w. Or. XLVII, r.1 of the C.P.C., the errorcan be an error of fact or of law – Error has been described as apalpable error or glaring omission – As to what constitutes anerror apparent on the face of record, is a matter to be found incontext of the facts of each case.Police – Police officer – Power of – Power of police officerwider and different from that of writ Court – Held (Per K.M.Joseph, J.(concurring)): In the instant case, the CBI is the premierinvestigation agency of the country – It is equipped to undertakeall forms of investigations, be it technical or otherwise – TheSupreme Court held in the writ petitions filed before this ReviewPetitions, that it is neither appropriate nor with the Court’sexperience to step into what is technically feasible or not – No suchlimitation applies to an investigator of a cognizable offence – Whatis important is that it is the duty of the investigating officer to collectall material, be it technical or otherwise and thereafter, submit anappropriate report to the Court concerned, be it a final report orchallan depending upon the materials unearthed – The Court hadrelied on absence of the substantial materials – However, this isnot the restriction on the Investigating Officer",

Onlya redacted portion of the report was placed before the Parliamentand in public domain” should be replaced by: “ The Governmenthas already shared the pricing details with the CAG. The report ofthe CAG is examined by the PAC in the usual course of business.Only a redacted version of the report is placed before theParliament and in Public domain”.Rafale Fighter Jets Case – Judgment – Review of – It wascontended by the petitioner that in writ petition a prayer was madefor registration of an FIR and investigation by the CBI, which wasnot dealt with and the contract was reviewed prematurely by theJudiciary without the benefit of investigation and inquiry into thedisputed questions of facts – Held (Per Sanjay Kishan Kaul, J.for himself and Ranjan Gogoi, CJI.) : Not a fair submission forthe reason that all counsels, including counsel representing thepetitioners in this matter addressed elaborate submissions on all the aspects – There was a prayer for registration of F.I.R andfurther investigation but then once all the aspects were examinedon merits, the Supreme Court did not consider it appropriate to issueany directions.Rafale Fighter Jets Case – Judgment – Review of – Pricingof the Jets – Held (Per Sanjay Kishan Kaul, J. for himself andRanjan Gogoi, CJI.) : It is not the function of the Supreme Courtto determine the prices nor for that matter can such aspects bedealt with on mere suspicion of persons who decide to approachthe Court – The internal mechanism of such pricing would takecare of the situation – The pricing of the basic aircraft had to becompared which was competitively marginally lower – As to whatshould be loaded on the aircraft or not and what further pricingshould be added has to be left to the best judgment of thecompetent authorities.Rafale Fighter Jets Case – Judgment – Review of – ContemptPetition – The contempt petition emanates from an allegationagainst the then President of the Indian National Congress onaccount of utterances made in the presence of several mediapersons that the Supreme Court was in consonance with what hisdiscourse was, i.e. that the prime Minister of India stole money fromthe Air Force and give it to a particular business group and PrimeMinister had indulged in corruption – Held (Sanjay Kishan Kaul,J. for himself and Ranjan Gogoi, CJI.): The matter wascompounded by filing a 20 page affidavit with a large number ofdocuments annexed rather than simply accepting the mistake andgiving an unconditional apology – However, a subsequent affidavitwas filed on 08.05.2019 with better wisdom – In view of thesubsequent affidavit, better sense having prevailed – The ContemptProceedings are closed with a word of caution for the contemnorto be more careful in future.Rafale Fighter Jets Case – Judgment – Review of – Thecomplaint is that the Supreme Court totally overlooked the reliefsought in Writ Petition (Criminal) No. 298 of 2018 – In the saidwrit petition, the petitioner had sought registration of an F.I.R. andinvestigation of the offences disclosed – The petitioners in the saidcase, premise their case on the judgment of the Supreme Court in Lalita Kumari v. Government of Uttar Pradesh and others – It iscontended that error is apparent in not even considering the impactof the Constitution Bench and requires to be redressed through theReview Petition – Held (Per K.M. Joseph, J.(concurring)) : Thefour writ petitions were heard together, the Court had proceededto focus on the merits of the matter itself undoubtedly from the standpoint of the limited judicial review which it could undertake in amatter of the nature in question – On basis of the said exercise,the Court has concluded that there were no materials for the Courtto interfere – But this is a far cry from holding that it will not followthe mandate of the Constitution bench of the Supreme Court inregard to the steps to be undertaken by the officer on receipt of acomplaint purporting to make out the commission of a cognizableoffence – The Supreme Court may declare that it was non-suitingthe petitioners seeking judicial review, having regard to the absenceof materials which would have justified holding the award of thecontract in question vulnerable – It would not mean it is eitherprecluded or that it was not duty-bound to still direct that the lawlaid down by the Constitution bench in Lalita Kumari be conformedto – Also, the Constitution Bench in Lalita Kumari had consideredthe necessity for preliminary inquiry in of fences relating tocorruption – Therefore, the petitioners may not be justified inapproaching the Supreme Court seeking the relief of registrationof an F.I.R. and investigation on the same as such – This for thereason as there were allegations of corruption and the petitionerhad not sought relief of a preliminary inquiry – Furthermore, thepetitioners had filed complaint fully knowing that s. 17A of thePrevention of Corruption (Amendment) Act, 2018 constituted a barto any inquiry or enquiry or investigation unless there was previousapproval – The petitioners had requested approval u/s. 17A in thecomplaint but the same relief was not sought in the writ petition –Even proceeding on the basis that on petitioners’ complaint, an FIRmust be registered as it purports to disclose cognizable offencesand the Court must so direct, it will be a futile exercise havingregard to s.17A – In the instant case, the petitioners cannot succeedin the Review petition – However, the judgment sought to bereviewed, would not stand in the way of the first respondent-CBIfrom taking action on the complaint in accordance with law andsubject to obtaining previous approval u/s. 17A of the Act, 2018 Constitution of India – Art.137 – Review – Jurisdiction in –Held (Per K.M. Joseph, J. (concurring)): The principle well-settledin regard to jurisdiction in review, is that a review is not an appealin disguise – The applicant, in a review, is, on most occasions, toldoff the gates, by pointing out that his remedy lay in pursuing anappeal – In the case of a decision rendered by the Supreme Court,it is to be noticed that the underpinning based on availability ofan appeal, is not available as the Supreme Court is the final Courtand no appeal l ies – While a review petit ion has not beenunderstood as an appeal in disguise and a mere erroneous decisionmay not justify a review, a decision which betrays an error whichis apparent, does entitle the Court to exercise its jurisdiction u/Art.137 of the Constitution.Constitution of India – Art.137 – Code of Civil Procedure,1908 – Or. XLVII, r.1 – Review – Maintainability of – Held (PerK.M. Joseph, J.(concurring)): A Review Petition is maintainableif the impugned judgment of the Supreme Court discloses an errorapparent on the face of the record – For granting review u/Art.137 of the Constitution r/w. Or. XLVII, r.1 of the C.P.C., the errorcan be an error of fact or of law – Error has been described as apalpable error or glaring omission – As to what constitutes anerror apparent on the face of record, is a matter to be found incontext of the facts of each case.Police – Police officer – Power of – Power of police officerwider and different from that of writ Court – Held (Per K.M.Joseph, J.(concurring)): In the instant case, the CBI is the premierinvestigation agency of the country – It is equipped to undertakeall forms of investigations, be it technical or otherwise – TheSupreme Court held in the writ petitions filed before this ReviewPetitions, that it is neither appropriate nor with the Court’sexperience to step into what is technically feasible or not – No suchlimitation applies to an investigator of a cognizable offence – Whatis important is that it is the duty of the investigating officer to collectall material, be it technical or otherwise and thereafter, submit anappropriate report to the Court concerned, be it a final report orchallan depending upon the materials unearthed – The Court hadrelied on absence of the substantial materials – However, this isnot the restriction on the Investigating Officer",

Onlya redacted portion of the report was placed before the Parliamentand in public domain” should be replaced by: “ The Governmenthas already shared the pricing details with the CAG. The report ofthe CAG is examined by the PAC in the usual course of business.Only a redacted version of the report is placed before theParliament and in Public domain”.Rafale Fighter Jets Case – Judgment – Review of – It wascontended by the petitioner that in writ petition a prayer was madefor registration of an FIR and investigation by the CBI, which wasnot dealt with and the contract was reviewed prematurely by theJudiciary without the benefit of investigation and inquiry into thedisputed questions of facts – Held (Per Sanjay Kishan Kaul, J.for himself and Ranjan Gogoi, CJI.) : Not a fair submission forthe reason that all counsels, including counsel representing thepetitioners in this matter addressed elaborate submissions on all the aspects – There was a prayer for registration of F.I.R andfurther investigation but then once all the aspects were examinedon merits, the Supreme Court did not consider it appropriate to issueany directions.Rafale Fighter Jets Case – Judgment – Review of – Pricingof the Jets – Held (Per Sanjay Kishan Kaul, J. for himself andRanjan Gogoi, CJI.) : It is not the function of the Supreme Courtto determine the prices nor for that matter can such aspects bedealt with on mere suspicion of persons who decide to approachthe Court – The internal mechanism of such pricing would takecare of the situation – The pricing of the basic aircraft had to becompared which was competitively marginally lower – As to whatshould be loaded on the aircraft or not and what further pricingshould be added has to be left to the best judgment of thecompetent authorities.Rafale Fighter Jets Case – Judgment – Review of – ContemptPetition – The contempt petition emanates from an allegationagainst the then President of the Indian National Congress onaccount of utterances made in the presence of several mediapersons that the Supreme Court was in consonance with what hisdiscourse was, i.e. that the prime Minister of India stole money fromthe Air Force and give it to a particular business group and PrimeMinister had indulged in corruption – Held (Sanjay Kishan Kaul,J. for himself and Ranjan Gogoi, CJI.): The matter wascompounded by filing a 20 page affidavit with a large number ofdocuments annexed rather than simply accepting the mistake andgiving an unconditional apology – However, a subsequent affidavitwas filed on 08.05.2019 with better wisdom – In view of thesubsequent affidavit, better sense having prevailed – The ContemptProceedings are closed with a word of caution for the contemnorto be more careful in future.Rafale Fighter Jets Case – Judgment – Review of – Thecomplaint is that the Supreme Court totally overlooked the reliefsought in Writ Petition (Criminal) No. 298 of 2018 – In the saidwrit petition, the petitioner had sought registration of an F.I.R. andinvestigation of the offences disclosed – The petitioners in the saidcase, premise their case on the judgment of the Supreme Court in Lalita Kumari v. Government of Uttar Pradesh and others – It iscontended that error is apparent in not even considering the impactof the Constitution Bench and requires to be redressed through theReview Petition – Held (Per K.M. Joseph, J.(concurring)) : Thefour writ petitions were heard together, the Court had proceededto focus on the merits of the matter itself undoubtedly from the standpoint of the limited judicial review which it could undertake in amatter of the nature in question – On basis of the said exercise,the Court has concluded that there were no materials for the Courtto interfere – But this is a far cry from holding that it will not followthe mandate of the Constitution bench of the Supreme Court inregard to the steps to be undertaken by the officer on receipt of acomplaint purporting to make out the commission of a cognizableoffence – The Supreme Court may declare that it was non-suitingthe petitioners seeking judicial review, having regard to the absenceof materials which would have justified holding the award of thecontract in question vulnerable – It would not mean it is eitherprecluded or that it was not duty-bound to still direct that the lawlaid down by the Constitution bench in Lalita Kumari be conformedto – Also, the Constitution Bench in Lalita Kumari had consideredthe necessity for preliminary inquiry in of fences relating tocorruption – Therefore, the petitioners may not be justified inapproaching the Supreme Court seeking the relief of registrationof an F.I.R. and investigation on the same as such – This for thereason as there were allegations of corruption and the petitionerhad not sought relief of a preliminary inquiry – Furthermore, thepetitioners had filed complaint fully knowing that s. 17A of thePrevention of Corruption (Amendment) Act, 2018 constituted a barto any inquiry or enquiry or investigation unless there was previousapproval – The petitioners had requested approval u/s. 17A in thecomplaint but the same relief was not sought in the writ petition –Even proceeding on the basis that on petitioners’ complaint, an FIRmust be registered as it purports to disclose cognizable offencesand the Court must so direct, it will be a futile exercise havingregard to s.17A – In the instant case, the petitioners cannot succeedin the Review petition – However, the judgment sought to bereviewed, would not stand in the way of the first respondent-CBIfrom taking action on the complaint in accordance with law andsubject to obtaining previous approval u/s. 17A of the Act, 2018 Constitution of India – Art.137 – Review – Jurisdiction in –Held (Per K.M. Joseph, J. (concurring)): The principle well-settledin regard to jurisdiction in review, is that a review is not an appealin disguise – The applicant, in a review, is, on most occasions, toldoff the gates, by pointing out that his remedy lay in pursuing anappeal – In the case of a decision rendered by the Supreme Court,it is to be noticed that the underpinning based on availability ofan appeal, is not available as the Supreme Court is the final Courtand no appeal l ies – While a review petit ion has not beenunderstood as an appeal in disguise and a mere erroneous decisionmay not justify a review, a decision which betrays an error whichis apparent, does entitle the Court to exercise its jurisdiction u/Art.137 of the Constitution.Constitution of India – Art.137 – Code of Civil Procedure,1908 – Or. XLVII, r.1 – Review – Maintainability of – Held (PerK.M. Joseph, J.(concurring)): A Review Petition is maintainableif the impugned judgment of the Supreme Court discloses an errorapparent on the face of the record – For granting review u/Art.137 of the Constitution r/w. Or. XLVII, r.1 of the C.P.C., the errorcan be an error of fact or of law – Error has been described as apalpable error or glaring omission – As to what constitutes anerror apparent on the face of record, is a matter to be found incontext of the facts of each case.Police – Police officer – Power of – Power of police officerwider and different from that of writ Court – Held (Per K.M.Joseph, J.(concurring)): In the instant case, the CBI is the premierinvestigation agency of the country – It is equipped to undertakeall forms of investigations, be it technical or otherwise – TheSupreme Court held in the writ petitions filed before this ReviewPetitions, that it is neither appropriate nor with the Court’sexperience to step into what is technically feasible or not – No suchlimitation applies to an investigator of a cognizable offence – Whatis important is that it is the duty of the investigating officer to collectall material, be it technical or otherwise and thereafter, submit anappropriate report to the Court concerned, be it a final report orchallan depending upon the materials unearthed – The Court hadrelied on absence of the substantial materials – However, this isnot the restriction on the Investigating Officer",

Onlya redacted portion of the report was placed before the Parliamentand in public domain” should be replaced by: “ The Governmenthas already shared the pricing details with the CAG. The report ofthe CAG is examined by the PAC in the usual course of business.Only a redacted version of the report is placed before theParliament and in Public domain”.Rafale Fighter Jets Case – Judgment – Review of – It wascontended by the petitioner that in writ petition a prayer was madefor registration of an FIR and investigation by the CBI, which wasnot dealt with and the contract was reviewed prematurely by theJudiciary without the benefit of investigation and inquiry into thedisputed questions of facts – Held (Per Sanjay Kishan Kaul, J.for himself and Ranjan Gogoi, CJI.) : Not a fair submission forthe reason that all counsels, including counsel representing thepetitioners in this matter addressed elaborate submissions on all the aspects – There was a prayer for registration of F.I.R andfurther investigation but then once all the aspects were examinedon merits, the Supreme Court did not consider it appropriate to issueany directions.Rafale Fighter Jets Case – Judgment – Review of – Pricingof the Jets – Held (Per Sanjay Kishan Kaul, J. for himself andRanjan Gogoi, CJI.) : It is not the function of the Supreme Courtto determine the prices nor for that matter can such aspects bedealt with on mere suspicion of persons who decide to approachthe Court – The internal mechanism of such pricing would takecare of the situation – The pricing of the basic aircraft had to becompared which was competitively marginally lower – As to whatshould be loaded on the aircraft or not and what further pricingshould be added has to be left to the best judgment of thecompetent authorities.Rafale Fighter Jets Case – Judgment – Review of – ContemptPetition – The contempt petition emanates from an allegationagainst the then President of the Indian National Congress onaccount of utterances made in the presence of several mediapersons that the Supreme Court was in consonance with what hisdiscourse was, i.e. that the prime Minister of India stole money fromthe Air Force and give it to a particular business group and PrimeMinister had indulged in corruption – Held (Sanjay Kishan Kaul,J. for himself and Ranjan Gogoi, CJI.): The matter wascompounded by filing a 20 page affidavit with a large number ofdocuments annexed rather than simply accepting the mistake andgiving an unconditional apology – However, a subsequent affidavitwas filed on 08.05.2019 with better wisdom – In view of thesubsequent affidavit, better sense having prevailed – The ContemptProceedings are closed with a word of caution for the contemnorto be more careful in future.Rafale Fighter Jets Case – Judgment – Review of – Thecomplaint is that the Supreme Court totally overlooked the reliefsought in Writ Petition (Criminal) No. 298 of 2018 – In the saidwrit petition, the petitioner had sought registration of an F.I.R. andinvestigation of the offences disclosed – The petitioners in the saidcase, premise their case on the judgment of the Supreme Court in Lalita Kumari v. Government of Uttar Pradesh and others – It iscontended that error is apparent in not even considering the impactof the Constitution Bench and requires to be redressed through theReview Petition – Held (Per K.M. Joseph, J.(concurring)) : Thefour writ petitions were heard together, the Court had proceededto focus on the merits of the matter itself undoubtedly from the standpoint of the limited judicial review which it could undertake in amatter of the nature in question – On basis of the said exercise,the Court has concluded that there were no materials for the Courtto interfere – But this is a far cry from holding that it will not followthe mandate of the Constitution bench of the Supreme Court inregard to the steps to be undertaken by the officer on receipt of acomplaint purporting to make out the commission of a cognizableoffence – The Supreme Court may declare that it was non-suitingthe petitioners seeking judicial review, having regard to the absenceof materials which would have justified holding the award of thecontract in question vulnerable – It would not mean it is eitherprecluded or that it was not duty-bound to still direct that the lawlaid down by the Constitution bench in Lalita Kumari be conformedto – Also, the Constitution Bench in Lalita Kumari had consideredthe necessity for preliminary inquiry in of fences relating tocorruption – Therefore, the petitioners may not be justified inapproaching the Supreme Court seeking the relief of registrationof an F.I.R. and investigation on the same as such – This for thereason as there were allegations of corruption and the petitionerhad not sought relief of a preliminary inquiry – Furthermore, thepetitioners had filed complaint fully knowing that s. 17A of thePrevention of Corruption (Amendment) Act, 2018 constituted a barto any inquiry or enquiry or investigation unless there was previousapproval – The petitioners had requested approval u/s. 17A in thecomplaint but the same relief was not sought in the writ petition –Even proceeding on the basis that on petitioners’ complaint, an FIRmust be registered as it purports to disclose cognizable offencesand the Court must so direct, it will be a futile exercise havingregard to s.17A – In the instant case, the petitioners cannot succeedin the Review petition – However, the judgment sought to bereviewed, would not stand in the way of the first respondent-CBIfrom taking action on the complaint in accordance with law andsubject to obtaining previous approval u/s. 17A of the Act, 2018 Constitution of India – Art.137 – Review – Jurisdiction in –Held (Per K.M. Joseph, J. (concurring)): The principle well-settledin regard to jurisdiction in review, is that a review is not an appealin disguise – The applicant, in a review, is, on most occasions, toldoff the gates, by pointing out that his remedy lay in pursuing anappeal – In the case of a decision rendered by the Supreme Court,it is to be noticed that the underpinning based on availability ofan appeal, is not available as the Supreme Court is the final Courtand no appeal l ies – While a review petit ion has not beenunderstood as an appeal in disguise and a mere erroneous decisionmay not justify a review, a decision which betrays an error whichis apparent, does entitle the Court to exercise its jurisdiction u/Art.137 of the Constitution.Constitution of India – Art.137 – Code of Civil Procedure,1908 – Or. XLVII, r.1 – Review – Maintainability of – Held (PerK.M. Joseph, J.(concurring)): A Review Petition is maintainableif the impugned judgment of the Supreme Court discloses an errorapparent on the face of the record – For granting review u/Art.137 of the Constitution r/w. Or. XLVII, r.1 of the C.P.C., the errorcan be an error of fact or of law – Error has been described as apalpable error or glaring omission – As to what constitutes anerror apparent on the face of record, is a matter to be found incontext of the facts of each case.Police – Police officer – Power of – Power of police officerwider and different from that of writ Court – Held (Per K.M.Joseph, J.(concurring)): In the instant case, the CBI is the premierinvestigation agency of the country – It is equipped to undertakeall forms of investigations, be it technical or otherwise – TheSupreme Court held in the writ petitions filed before this ReviewPetitions, that it is neither appropriate nor with the Court’sexperience to step into what is technically feasible or not – No suchlimitation applies to an investigator of a cognizable offence – Whatis important is that it is the duty of the investigating officer to collectall material, be it technical or otherwise and thereafter, submit anappropriate report to the Court concerned, be it a final report orchallan depending upon the materials unearthed – The Court hadrelied on absence of the substantial materials – However, this isnot the restriction on the Investigating Officer",

Onlya redacted portion of the report was placed before the Parliamentand in public domain” should be replaced by: “ The Governmenthas already shared the pricing details with the CAG. The report ofthe CAG is examined by the PAC in the usual course of business.Only a redacted version of the report is placed before theParliament and in Public domain”.Rafale Fighter Jets Case – Judgment – Review of – It wascontended by the petitioner that in writ petition a prayer was madefor registration of an FIR and investigation by the CBI, which wasnot dealt with and the contract was reviewed prematurely by theJudiciary without the benefit of investigation and inquiry into thedisputed questions of facts – Held (Per Sanjay Kishan Kaul, J.for himself and Ranjan Gogoi, CJI.) : Not a fair submission forthe reason that all counsels, including counsel representing thepetitioners in this matter addressed elaborate submissions on all the aspects – There was a prayer for registration of F.I.R andfurther investigation but then once all the aspects were examinedon merits, the Supreme Court did not consider it appropriate to issueany directions.Rafale Fighter Jets Case – Judgment – Review of – Pricingof the Jets – Held (Per Sanjay Kishan Kaul, J. for himself andRanjan Gogoi, CJI.) : It is not the function of the Supreme Courtto determine the prices nor for that matter can such aspects bedealt with on mere suspicion of persons who decide to approachthe Court – The internal mechanism of such pricing would takecare of the situation – The pricing of the basic aircraft had to becompared which was competitively marginally lower – As to whatshould be loaded on the aircraft or not and what further pricingshould be added has to be left to the best judgment of thecompetent authorities.Rafale Fighter Jets Case – Judgment – Review of – ContemptPetition – The contempt petition emanates from an allegationagainst the then President of the Indian National Congress onaccount of utterances made in the presence of several mediapersons that the Supreme Court was in consonance with what hisdiscourse was, i.e. that the prime Minister of India stole money fromthe Air Force and give it to a particular business group and PrimeMinister had indulged in corruption – Held (Sanjay Kishan Kaul,J. for himself and Ranjan Gogoi, CJI.): The matter wascompounded by filing a 20 page affidavit with a large number ofdocuments annexed rather than simply accepting the mistake andgiving an unconditional apology – However, a subsequent affidavitwas filed on 08.05.2019 with better wisdom – In view of thesubsequent affidavit, better sense having prevailed – The ContemptProceedings are closed with a word of caution for the contemnorto be more careful in future.Rafale Fighter Jets Case – Judgment – Review of – Thecomplaint is that the Supreme Court totally overlooked the reliefsought in Writ Petition (Criminal) No. 298 of 2018 – In the saidwrit petition, the petitioner had sought registration of an F.I.R. andinvestigation of the offences disclosed – The petitioners in the saidcase, premise their case on the judgment of the Supreme Court in Lalita Kumari v. Government of Uttar Pradesh and others – It iscontended that error is apparent in not even considering the impactof the Constitution Bench and requires to be redressed through theReview Petition – Held (Per K.M. Joseph, J.(concurring)) : Thefour writ petitions were heard together, the Court had proceededto focus on the merits of the matter itself undoubtedly from the standpoint of the limited judicial review which it could undertake in amatter of the nature in question – On basis of the said exercise,the Court has concluded that there were no materials for the Courtto interfere – But this is a far cry from holding that it will not followthe mandate of the Constitution bench of the Supreme Court inregard to the steps to be undertaken by the officer on receipt of acomplaint purporting to make out the commission of a cognizableoffence – The Supreme Court may declare that it was non-suitingthe petitioners seeking judicial review, having regard to the absenceof materials which would have justified holding the award of thecontract in question vulnerable – It would not mean it is eitherprecluded or that it was not duty-bound to still direct that the lawlaid down by the Constitution bench in Lalita Kumari be conformedto – Also, the Constitution Bench in Lalita Kumari had consideredthe necessity for preliminary inquiry in of fences relating tocorruption – Therefore, the petitioners may not be justified inapproaching the Supreme Court seeking the relief of registrationof an F.I.R. and investigation on the same as such – This for thereason as there were allegations of corruption and the petitionerhad not sought relief of a preliminary inquiry – Furthermore, thepetitioners had filed complaint fully knowing that s. 17A of thePrevention of Corruption (Amendment) Act, 2018 constituted a barto any inquiry or enquiry or investigation unless there was previousapproval – The petitioners had requested approval u/s. 17A in thecomplaint but the same relief was not sought in the writ petition –Even proceeding on the basis that on petitioners’ complaint, an FIRmust be registered as it purports to disclose cognizable offencesand the Court must so direct, it will be a futile exercise havingregard to s.17A – In the instant case, the petitioners cannot succeedin the Review petition – However, the judgment sought to bereviewed, would not stand in the way of the first respondent-CBIfrom taking action on the complaint in accordance with law andsubject to obtaining previous approval u/s. 17A of the Act, 2018 Constitution of India – Art.137 – Review – Jurisdiction in –Held (Per K.M. Joseph, J. (concurring)): The principle well-settledin regard to jurisdiction in review, is that a review is not an appealin disguise – The applicant, in a review, is, on most occasions, toldoff the gates, by pointing out that his remedy lay in pursuing anappeal – In the case of a decision rendered by the Supreme Court,it is to be noticed that the underpinning based on availability ofan appeal, is not available as the Supreme Court is the final Courtand no appeal l ies – While a review petit ion has not beenunderstood as an appeal in disguise and a mere erroneous decisionmay not justify a review, a decision which betrays an error whichis apparent, does entitle the Court to exercise its jurisdiction u/Art.137 of the Constitution.Constitution of India – Art.137 – Code of Civil Procedure,1908 – Or. XLVII, r.1 – Review – Maintainability of – Held (PerK.M. Joseph, J.(concurring)): A Review Petition is maintainableif the impugned judgment of the Supreme Court discloses an errorapparent on the face of the record – For granting review u/Art.137 of the Constitution r/w. Or. XLVII, r.1 of the C.P.C., the errorcan be an error of fact or of law – Error has been described as apalpable error or glaring omission – As to what constitutes anerror apparent on the face of record, is a matter to be found incontext of the facts of each case.Police – Police officer – Power of – Power of police officerwider and different from that of writ Court – Held (Per K.M.Joseph, J.(concurring)): In the instant case, the CBI is the premierinvestigation agency of the country – It is equipped to undertakeall forms of investigations, be it technical or otherwise – TheSupreme Court held in the writ petitions filed before this ReviewPetitions, that it is neither appropriate nor with the Court’sexperience to step into what is technically feasible or not – No suchlimitation applies to an investigator of a cognizable offence – Whatis important is that it is the duty of the investigating officer to collectall material, be it technical or otherwise and thereafter, submit anappropriate report to the Court concerned, be it a final report orchallan depending upon the materials unearthed – The Court hadrelied on absence of the substantial materials – However, this isnot the restriction on the Investigating Officer",

Khanwilkar, Indu Malhotra, JJ.) – Debate aboutconstitutional validity of practices entailing into restriction of entryof women generally in the place of worship is not limited to thiscase, but also arises in respect of entry of Muslim women inDurgah/Mosque; Parsi women married to a non-Parsi into the holyfire place of an Agyari – Another seminal issue pendingconsideration in Supreme Court relates to female genital mutilationin Dawoodi Bohra community – Issues arising in such pendingcases may be overlapping and covered by the judgment underreview – Prospect of the issues arising therein being referred tolarger bench cannot be ruled out – Further, conflict betweendecision of the Seven Judges bench in Commissioner, Hindu ReligiousEndowments, Madras v. Shri Lakshmindra Tirtha Swamiar of ShirurMutt (Shirur Mutt) reported as [1954] SCR 1005 and the subsequentview of Five Judges bench in Durgah Committee, Ajmer v. SyedHussain Ali & Ors. reported as [1962] 1 SCR 383 requiresconsideration by a larger bench – Larger bench may also considerit appropriate to decide all issues, including the question as towhether the 1965 Rules govern the temple in question at all – Review petitions and the writ petitions may remain pending untildetermination of the questions, as indicated, by a Larger Benchas may be constituted by the Hon’ble the Chief Justice of India –Per R.F. Nariman, J. (for himself and Dr. D.Y. Chandrachud, J.)(Dissenting) Only thing that is before this Court is the narrowquestion as to whether grounds for review and for filing of thewrit petitions have been made out qua the judgment under reviewin Indian Young Lawyers Association and Ors. v. State of Keralareported as [2018] 9 SCR 561 – What a future constitution bench/larger bench, if constituted by the Chief Justice of India, may ormay not do when considering the other issues pending before thisCourt is not before this Court at all – In the five-Judge BenchIndian Young Lawyers Association’s case, four majority judgmentshad clear consensus on the issues- (i) that the devotees of LordAyyappado not constitute a separate religious denomination andthus, cannot claim the benefit of Art.26 or the proviso to s.3 ofthe 1965 Act; (ii) aforesaid four judgments specifically groundedthe right of women between the ages of 10 to 50, excluded frompracticing their religion, u/Art.25(1) emphasizing the expression“all persons” and the expression “equally” occurring in thatArticle, so that this right is equally available to both men andwomen of all ages professing the same religion and; (iii) that s.3of the 1965 Act traces its origin to Art.25(2)(b) and would applynotwithstanding any custom to the contrary, to enable Hindu womenthe right of entry in all public temples open to Hindus, so that theymay exercise the right of worship therein and as a concomitant,r.3(b) of the 1965 Rules is violative of Art.25(1) and ultra viress.3 of the 1965 Act – Further, observations of Chandrachud, J.on Art.17 cannot be said to be a material error manifest on theface of the record undermining the soundness of the threeconclusions reached by all the majority judgments – On whetherthe exclusion of women from Hindu temples is an essential part ofthe Hindu religion, three Judges clearly held that it is not – Thereis no error apparent here again – Also, “constitutional morality”has now reached the level of stare decisis, and has been explainedin several Constitution Bench judgments, reliance thereon cannotbe said to suffer from any error apparent– Extreme arguments thatbelief and faith are not judicially reviewable by courts, and thatthis Court cannot interfere by stating that a particular section ofpersons shall not hold a particular belief and act in accordance thereto, not only do not constitute “errors apparent”, but arearguments that fly in the face of Art.25 – Given the consensus onthe three issues by the four majority judgments, no ground forreview of the majority judgments made out – Review petitionsdismissed – Writ petitions also dismissed as not being maintainable– State of Kerala to give wide publicity to this judgment throughthe medium of television, newspapers, etc. – Organised acts ofresistance to thwart the implementation of the judgment be putdown firmly – State government to ensure that the rule of law ispreserved – Supreme Court Rules, 2013 – Or.XLVII – Kerala HinduPlaces of Public Worship (Authorisation of Entry) Act, 1965 – s.3– Kerala Hindu Places of Public Worship (Authorisation of Entry)Rules,1965–r.3(b)–Doctrine of stare decisis – Public InterestLitigation – Principle of Res Judicata.",

Khanwilkar, Indu Malhotra, JJ.) – Debate aboutconstitutional validity of practices entailing into restriction of entryof women generally in the place of worship is not limited to thiscase, but also arises in respect of entry of Muslim women inDurgah/Mosque; Parsi women married to a non-Parsi into the holyfire place of an Agyari – Another seminal issue pendingconsideration in Supreme Court relates to female genital mutilationin Dawoodi Bohra community – Issues arising in such pendingcases may be overlapping and covered by the judgment underreview – Prospect of the issues arising therein being referred tolarger bench cannot be ruled out – Further, conflict betweendecision of the Seven Judges bench in Commissioner, Hindu ReligiousEndowments, Madras v. Shri Lakshmindra Tirtha Swamiar of ShirurMutt (Shirur Mutt) reported as [1954] SCR 1005 and the subsequentview of Five Judges bench in Durgah Committee, Ajmer v. SyedHussain Ali & Ors. reported as [1962] 1 SCR 383 requiresconsideration by a larger bench – Larger bench may also considerit appropriate to decide all issues, including the question as towhether the 1965 Rules govern the temple in question at all – Review petitions and the writ petitions may remain pending untildetermination of the questions, as indicated, by a Larger Benchas may be constituted by the Hon’ble the Chief Justice of India –Per R.F. Nariman, J. (for himself and Dr. D.Y. Chandrachud, J.)(Dissenting) Only thing that is before this Court is the narrowquestion as to whether grounds for review and for filing of thewrit petitions have been made out qua the judgment under reviewin Indian Young Lawyers Association and Ors. v. State of Keralareported as [2018] 9 SCR 561 – What a future constitution bench/larger bench, if constituted by the Chief Justice of India, may ormay not do when considering the other issues pending before thisCourt is not before this Court at all – In the five-Judge BenchIndian Young Lawyers Association’s case, four majority judgmentshad clear consensus on the issues- (i) that the devotees of LordAyyappado not constitute a separate religious denomination andthus, cannot claim the benefit of Art.26 or the proviso to s.3 ofthe 1965 Act; (ii) aforesaid four judgments specifically groundedthe right of women between the ages of 10 to 50, excluded frompracticing their religion, u/Art.25(1) emphasizing the expression“all persons” and the expression “equally” occurring in thatArticle, so that this right is equally available to both men andwomen of all ages professing the same religion and; (iii) that s.3of the 1965 Act traces its origin to Art.25(2)(b) and would applynotwithstanding any custom to the contrary, to enable Hindu womenthe right of entry in all public temples open to Hindus, so that theymay exercise the right of worship therein and as a concomitant,r.3(b) of the 1965 Rules is violative of Art.25(1) and ultra viress.3 of the 1965 Act – Further, observations of Chandrachud, J.on Art.17 cannot be said to be a material error manifest on theface of the record undermining the soundness of the threeconclusions reached by all the majority judgments – On whetherthe exclusion of women from Hindu temples is an essential part ofthe Hindu religion, three Judges clearly held that it is not – Thereis no error apparent here again – Also, “constitutional morality”has now reached the level of stare decisis, and has been explainedin several Constitution Bench judgments, reliance thereon cannotbe said to suffer from any error apparent– Extreme arguments thatbelief and faith are not judicially reviewable by courts, and thatthis Court cannot interfere by stating that a particular section ofpersons shall not hold a particular belief and act in accordance thereto, not only do not constitute “errors apparent”, but arearguments that fly in the face of Art.25 – Given the consensus onthe three issues by the four majority judgments, no ground forreview of the majority judgments made out – Review petitionsdismissed – Writ petitions also dismissed as not being maintainable– State of Kerala to give wide publicity to this judgment throughthe medium of television, newspapers, etc. – Organised acts ofresistance to thwart the implementation of the judgment be putdown firmly – State government to ensure that the rule of law ispreserved – Supreme Court Rules, 2013 – Or.XLVII – Kerala HinduPlaces of Public Worship (Authorisation of Entry) Act, 1965 – s.3– Kerala Hindu Places of Public Worship (Authorisation of Entry)Rules,1965–r.3(b)–Doctrine of stare decisis – Public InterestLitigation – Principle of Res Judicata.",

Nariman, J. (for himself and Dr. D.Y.

State of Keralareported as [2018] 9 SCR 561 – What a future constitution bench/larger bench, if constituted by the Chief Justice of India, may ormay not do when considering the other issues pending before thisCourt is not before this Court at all – In the five-Judge BenchIndian Young Lawyers Association’s case, four majority judgmentshad clear consensus on the issues- (i) that the devotees of LordAyyappado not constitute a separate religious denomination andthus, cannot claim the benefit of Art.26 or the proviso to s.3 ofthe 1965 Act; (ii) aforesaid four judgments specifically groundedthe right of women between the ages of 10 to 50, excluded frompracticing their religion, u/Art.25(1) emphasizing the expression“all persons” and the expression “equally” occurring in thatArticle, so that this right is equally available to both men andwomen of all ages professing the same religion and; (iii) that s.3of the 1965 Act traces its origin to Art.25(2)(b) and would applynotwithstanding any custom to the contrary, to enable Hindu womenthe right of entry in all public temples open to Hindus, so that theymay exercise the right of worship therein and as a concomitant,r.3(b) of the 1965 Rules is violative of Art.25(1) and ultra viress.3 of the 1965 Act – Further, observations of Chandrachud, J.on Art.17 cannot be said to be a material error manifest on theface of the record undermining the soundness of the threeconclusions reached by all the majority judgments – On whetherthe exclusion of women from Hindu temples is an essential part ofthe Hindu religion, three Judges clearly held that it is not – Thereis no error apparent here again – Also, “constitutional morality”has now reached the level of stare decisis, and has been explainedin several Constitution Bench judgments, reliance thereon cannotbe said to suffer from any error apparent– Extreme arguments thatbelief and faith are not judicially reviewable by courts, and thatthis Court cannot interfere by stating that a particular section ofpersons shall not hold a particular belief and act in accordance thereto, not only do not constitute “errors apparent”, but arearguments that fly in the face of Art.25 – Given the consensus onthe three issues by the four majority judgments, no ground forreview of the majority judgments made out – Review petitionsdismissed – Writ petitions also dismissed as not being maintainable– State of Kerala to give wide publicity to this judgment throughthe medium of television, newspapers, etc. – Organised acts ofresistance to thwart the implementation of the judgment be putdown firmly – State government to ensure that the rule of law ispreserved – Supreme Court Rules, 2013 – Or.XLVII – Kerala HinduPlaces of Public Worship (Authorisation of Entry) Act, 1965 – s.3– Kerala Hindu Places of Public Worship (Authorisation of Entry)Rules,1965–r.3(b)–Doctrine of stare decisis – Public InterestLitigation – Principle of Res Judicata.",

Shri Lakshmindra Tirtha Swamiar of ShirurMutt (Shirur Mutt) reported as [1954] SCR 1005 and the subsequentview of Five Judges bench in Durgah Committee, Ajmer v.

Nariman, J. (for himself and Dr. D.Y.

State of Keralareported as [2018] 9 SCR 561 – What a future constitution bench/larger bench, if constituted by the Chief Justice of India, may ormay not do when considering the other issues pending before thisCourt is not before this Court at all – In the five-Judge BenchIndian Young Lawyers Association’s case, four majority judgmentshad clear consensus on the issues- (i) that the devotees of LordAyyappado not constitute a separate religious denomination andthus, cannot claim the benefit of Art.26 or the proviso to s.3 ofthe 1965 Act; (ii) aforesaid four judgments specifically groundedthe right of women between the ages of 10 to 50, excluded frompracticing their religion, u/Art.25(1) emphasizing the expression“all persons” and the expression “equally” occurring in thatArticle, so that this right is equally available to both men andwomen of all ages professing the same religion and; (iii) that s.3of the 1965 Act traces its origin to Art.25(2)(b) and would applynotwithstanding any custom to the contrary, to enable Hindu womenthe right of entry in all public temples open to Hindus, so that theymay exercise the right of worship therein and as a concomitant,r.3(b) of the 1965 Rules is violative of Art.25(1) and ultra viress.3 of the 1965 Act – Further, observations of Chandrachud, J.on Art.17 cannot be said to be a material error manifest on theface of the record undermining the soundness of the threeconclusions reached by all the majority judgments – On whetherthe exclusion of women from Hindu temples is an essential part ofthe Hindu religion, three Judges clearly held that it is not – Thereis no error apparent here again – Also, “constitutional morality”has now reached the level of stare decisis, and has been explainedin several Constitution Bench judgments, reliance thereon cannotbe said to suffer from any error apparent– Extreme arguments thatbelief and faith are not judicially reviewable by courts, and thatthis Court cannot interfere by stating that a particular section ofpersons shall not hold a particular belief and act in accordance thereto, not only do not constitute “errors apparent”, but arearguments that fly in the face of Art.25 – Given the consensus onthe three issues by the four majority judgments, no ground forreview of the majority judgments made out – Review petitionsdismissed – Writ petitions also dismissed as not being maintainable– State of Kerala to give wide publicity to this judgment throughthe medium of television, newspapers, etc. – Organised acts ofresistance to thwart the implementation of the judgment be putdown firmly – State government to ensure that the rule of law ispreserved – Supreme Court Rules, 2013 – Or.XLVII – Kerala HinduPlaces of Public Worship (Authorisation of Entry) Act, 1965 – s.3– Kerala Hindu Places of Public Worship (Authorisation of Entry)Rules,1965–r.3(b)–Doctrine of stare decisis – Public InterestLitigation – Principle of Res Judicata.",

Khanwilkar, Indu Malhotra, JJ.) – Debate aboutconstitutional validity of practices entailing into restriction of entryof women generally in the place of worship is not limited to thiscase, but also arises in respect of entry of Muslim women inDurgah/Mosque; Parsi women married to a non-Parsi into the holyfire place of an Agyari – Another seminal issue pendingconsideration in Supreme Court relates to female genital mutilationin Dawoodi Bohra community – Issues arising in such pendingcases may be overlapping and covered by the judgment underreview – Prospect of the issues arising therein being referred tolarger bench cannot be ruled out – Further, conflict betweendecision of the Seven Judges bench in Commissioner, Hindu ReligiousEndowments, Madras v. Shri Lakshmindra Tirtha Swamiar of ShirurMutt (Shirur Mutt) reported as [1954] SCR 1005 and the subsequentview of Five Judges bench in Durgah Committee, Ajmer v. SyedHussain Ali & Ors. reported as [1962] 1 SCR 383 requiresconsideration by a larger bench – Larger bench may also considerit appropriate to decide all issues, including the question as towhether the 1965 Rules govern the temple in question at all – Review petitions and the writ petitions may remain pending untildetermination of the questions, as indicated, by a Larger Benchas may be constituted by the Hon’ble the Chief Justice of India –Per R.F. Nariman, J. (for himself and Dr. D.Y. Chandrachud, J.)(Dissenting) Only thing that is before this Court is the narrowquestion as to whether grounds for review and for filing of thewrit petitions have been made out qua the judgment under reviewin Indian Young Lawyers Association and Ors. v. State of Keralareported as [2018] 9 SCR 561 – What a future constitution bench/larger bench, if constituted by the Chief Justice of India, may ormay not do when considering the other issues pending before thisCourt is not before this Court at all – In the five-Judge BenchIndian Young Lawyers Association’s case, four majority judgmentshad clear consensus on the issues- (i) that the devotees of LordAyyappado not constitute a separate religious denomination andthus, cannot claim the benefit of Art.26 or the proviso to s.3 ofthe 1965 Act; (ii) aforesaid four judgments specifically groundedthe right of women between the ages of 10 to 50, excluded frompracticing their religion, u/Art.25(1) emphasizing the expression“all persons” and the expression “equally” occurring in thatArticle, so that this right is equally available to both men andwomen of all ages professing the same religion and; (iii) that s.3of the 1965 Act traces its origin to Art.25(2)(b) and would applynotwithstanding any custom to the contrary, to enable Hindu womenthe right of entry in all public temples open to Hindus, so that theymay exercise the right of worship therein and as a concomitant,r.3(b) of the 1965 Rules is violative of Art.25(1) and ultra viress.3 of the 1965 Act – Further, observations of Chandrachud, J.on Art.17 cannot be said to be a material error manifest on theface of the record undermining the soundness of the threeconclusions reached by all the majority judgments – On whetherthe exclusion of women from Hindu temples is an essential part ofthe Hindu religion, three Judges clearly held that it is not – Thereis no error apparent here again – Also, “constitutional morality”has now reached the level of stare decisis, and has been explainedin several Constitution Bench judgments, reliance thereon cannotbe said to suffer from any error apparent– Extreme arguments thatbelief and faith are not judicially reviewable by courts, and thatthis Court cannot interfere by stating that a particular section ofpersons shall not hold a particular belief and act in accordance thereto, not only do not constitute “errors apparent”, but arearguments that fly in the face of Art.25 – Given the consensus onthe three issues by the four majority judgments, no ground forreview of the majority judgments made out – Review petitionsdismissed – Writ petitions also dismissed as not being maintainable– State of Kerala to give wide publicity to this judgment throughthe medium of television, newspapers, etc. – Organised acts ofresistance to thwart the implementation of the judgment be putdown firmly – State government to ensure that the rule of law ispreserved – Supreme Court Rules, 2013 – Or.XLVII – Kerala HinduPlaces of Public Worship (Authorisation of Entry) Act, 1965 – s.3– Kerala Hindu Places of Public Worship (Authorisation of Entry)Rules,1965–r.3(b)–Doctrine of stare decisis – Public InterestLitigation – Principle of Res Judicata.",

conditionaldelegat ion and is valid and permissible – Once a policy ofextension of laws has been laid down by the Parliament and isclear and permissible, it would only seem as an inevitable falloutthat the executive should be permitted to extend future amendmentsto the existing laws – Thus, the challenge predicated on thedoctrine of excessive delegation, separation of powers, doctrineof the law of agency, cannot be accepted – Administrative law –Conditional delegation – East Punjab Urban Rent Restriction(Amendment) Act, 2001 – Punjab Re-organisation Act, 1966 –s. 87 s. 13-B – Amendments made vide the Amendment Act withregard to the rights of Non-Resident Indians by the State Legislatureof Punjab – Legislative competence of the State – Held:Amendment Act enacted by the State legislature was well within itscompetence – Amendment Act on its true construction and byreference to the doctrine of “pith and substance” is relatable tothe relat ionship of landlord and tenant for housing andaccommodation and falls under the Concurrent List – Dominantintention or “pith and substance” of the legislation is to regulatethe relationship between Non-Resident Indian landlords and tenantsfor housing and accommodation – Merely because the AmendmentAct to achieve its object touches upon the subject matter in respectof Non-Resident Indian landlords in the Rent Act, does not makethe Amendment or the Rent Act ultra vires the Constitution – In thecontext of the Union Territory of Chandigarh and as the subjectmatter falls within the Concurrent List, it would be immaterial todecide on the competence of the legislating body – Power to makelaws in respect of a Union Territory vests with the Parliament underArt.246(4) – In terms of s. 87 of the Re-organisation Act, the powerto extend laws to the Union Territory of Chandigarh vests with theCentral Government, that is the Parliament or the CentralExecutive, as the case may be, and is permissible – Constitutionof India – Art. 246(4) – East Punjab Urban Rent Restriction(Amendment) Act, 2001 – Punjab Re-organisation Act, 1966 –s. 87. s. 13-B – Plea that s. 13-B creates a special class of NRIlandlords, however, does not afford any legal remedy to the tenants– Reasonability of – Held: By providing for a simplified procedureof eviction by the Non-Resident Indians, s. 13-B does not dilutethe rights of tenants – It gives a chance to the tenants on merits toestablish their case and when justified and necessary to take thematter to trial – Thus, s. 13-B cannot be held to be arbitrary andunreasonable.s. 13-B – s. 13-B classifying non-Resident Indian landlordsas a separate category – Validity of Section 13-B – Held: Section13-B cannot be treated as an arbitrary classification that infringesand violates Article 14 – It cannot be held to be unconstitutionalbecause it grants a right to claim eviction for bona fide need bysummary procedure to a certain group of landlords-Non-Resident Indians subject to and on the satisfaction of statutory conditionswhich incorporate a check on frivolous evictions – It rests withthe legislature to make laws and extend it to other similarly situatedpersons – Rent Act(s) invariably give similar rights by a controlledmechanism and alluded riders to various other classes/groups oflandlords, namely, government servants, members of armed forces,the retired or soon to retire employees of the Central and the StateGovernments, widows, etc – Constitution of India – Art.14.s. 13-B – Restrictions and conditions imposed on landlordseeking eviction under – Purpose of – Held: In terms of Section13-B, the condition imposed upon the landlord is that he shouldhave been the owner of the premises for five years before theeviction petition is filed – Such landlord/owner is permitted to filean eviction petition only once during the lifetime and in respect ofone building – Landlord cannot sell or give the premises on leasefor a period of five years from the date of taking possession fromthe tenant – On breach of the same, the tenant has a right to seekrestoration of possession – In case the landlord does not occupythe premises for a continuous period of three months after gettingan eviction order or lets out the whole or any part of the premisesto a third person other than the tenant in contravention of theprovisions of s. 13 B(3), punishment is imposed-– Thus, theserestrictions and conditions are strong in-built checks to ensure thatthe need of the landlord should be genuine and bona fide and thetenant should not be subjected to frivolous and dubious evictionorder by relying on false assertions.s.18-A and s.13-B – Right of Non-Resident Indians to initiateeviction under the summary procedure – Nature of – Held: Is notan unfettered and absolute right – It is subject to satisfaction ofvarious pre-requisites and imperatives that ensure and checkpotential abuse by resorting to a short-circui t procedure –Requirement should arise from a genuine need of the Non-ResidentIndian landlord or his dependent – Furthermore, thesepre-conditions and post possession restrictions stated thereinsuggest that s. 13-B serves a specific policy objective to ensurethe right of Non-Resident Indians to occupy their property in theUnion Territory of Chandigarh and the State of Punjab as the casemay be, after “returning” to their country – This right has to bebalanced with the right of the tenants to establish their case on merits by disproving the genuine requirement of the Non-ResidentIndians – Constitution of India – Art. 14.Doctrines/Principles: Doctrine of Pith and substance –Meaning of – Held: Pith and substance doctrine states that if thelegislation is covered by an entry, that is, it is within the permittedjurisdiction of the legislature, any incidental encroachment in therival field has to be disregarded – Only when wide constructionof an entry leads to heads-on-clash with another entry in the sameor different List, the principle of harmonious construction isapplied to reconcile the conflict and to give effect to each of them.Constitution of India: Art. 254 – Repugnancy – Whenattracted – Held: Repugnancy arises between a Central and a StateAct when there is a direct and irreconcilable conflict between thetwo enactments and in that case, the Central Legislation prevailsby virtue of Art. 254 – Such repugnancy or inconsistency is not tobe readily inferred as the entries in the three Lists permit incidentalencroachment – Thus, every attempt must be made to placate theconflict and only when and in case of oppugnant clash, the courtshould proceed to strike down the legislation as trespassing beyondits legitimate and legal confines.Legislature: Function of – Held: Primary function of thelegislature is to make laws for all or different groups or classes ofpersons – Lawmakers as elected representatives are in a betterposition to know the needs, requirements and expectations ofcitizens – Thus, the legislature possesses the power to distinguishand classify persons or things subjected to such laws – Such aclassification, however, must pass the muster of Art. 14 whichproscribe hostile and invidious discrimination – Art. 14 does notentirely prohibit classification by grouping certain persons withspecial peculiarities in a special category to meet certain specificends.Legislation: Rent control legislation – Object of –

possession fromthe tenant – On breach of the same, the tenant has a right to seekrestoration of possession – In case the landlord does not occupythe premises for a continuous period of three months after gettingan eviction order or lets out the whole or any part of the premisesto a third person other than the tenant in contravention of theprovisions of s. 13 B(3), punishment is imposed-– Thus, theserestrictions and conditions are strong in-built checks to ensure thatthe need of the landlord should be genuine and bona fide and thetenant should not be subjected to frivolous and dubious evictionorder by relying on false assertions.s.18-A and s.13-B – Right of Non-Resident Indians to initiateeviction under the summary procedure – Nature of – Held: Is notan unfettered and absolute right – It is subject to satisfaction ofvarious pre-requisites and imperatives that ensure and checkpotential abuse by resorting to a short-circui t procedure –Requirement should arise from a genuine need of the Non-ResidentIndian landlord or his dependent – Furthermore, thesepre-conditions and post possession restrictions stated thereinsuggest that s. 13-B serves a specific policy objective to ensurethe right of Non-Resident Indians to occupy their property in theUnion Territory of Chandigarh and the State of Punjab as the casemay be, after “returning” to their country – This right has to bebalanced with the right of the tenants to establish their case on merits by disproving the genuine requirement of the Non-ResidentIndians – Constitution of India – Art. 14.Doctrines/Principles:

and a StateAct when there is a direct and irreconcilable conflict between thetwo enactments and in that case, the Central Legislation prevailsby virtue of Art. 254 – Such repugnancy or inconsistency is not tobe readily inferred as the entries in the three Lists permit incidentalencroachment – Thus, every attempt must be made to placate theconflict and only when and in case of oppugnant clash, the courtshould proceed to strike down the legislation as trespassing beyondits legitimate and legal confines.Legislature: Function of – Held: Primary function of thelegislature is to make laws for all or different groups or classes ofpersons – Lawmakers as elected representatives are in a betterposition to know the needs, requirements and expectations ofcitizens – Thus, the legislature possesses the power to distinguishand classify persons or things subjected to such laws – Such aclassification, however, must pass the muster of Art. 14 whichproscribe hostile and invidious discrimination – Art. 14

theAmendment Act to the Union Territory of Chandigarh by executiveaction – Validity of – Held: Extension of the Amendment Act to theUnion Territory of Chandigarh falls within the ambit of conditionaldelegat ion and is valid and permissible – Once a policy ofextension of laws has been laid down by the Parliament and isclear and permissible, it would only seem as an inevitable falloutthat the executive should be permitted to extend future amendmentsto the existing laws – Thus, the challenge predicated on thedoctrine of excessive delegation, separation of powers, doctrineof

Amendments made vide the Amendment Act withregard to the rights of Non-Resident Indians by the State Legislatureof Punjab – Legislative competence of the State – Held:Amendment Act enacted by the State legislature was well within itscompetence – Amendment Act on its true construction and byreference to the doctrine of “pith and substance” is relatable tothe relat ionship of landlord and tenant for housing andaccommodation and falls under the Concurrent List – Dominantintention or “pith and substance” of the legislation is to regulatethe relationship between Non-Resident Indian landlords and tenantsfor housing and accommodation – Merely because the AmendmentAct to achieve its object touches upon the subject matter in respectof Non-Resident Indian landlords in the Rent Act, does not makethe Amendment or the Rent Act ultra vires the Constitution – In thecontext of the Union Territory of Chandigarh and as the subjectmatter falls within the Concurrent List, it would be immaterial todecide on the competence of the legislating body – Power to makelaws in respect of a Union Territory vests with the Parliament underArt.246(4) – In terms of s. 87 of the Re-organisation Act, the powerto extend laws to the Union Territory of Chandigarh vests with theCentral Government, that is the Parliament or the CentralExecutive, as the case may be, and is permissible – Constitutionof India

not afford any legal remedy to the tenants– Reasonability of – Held: By providing for a simplified procedureof eviction by the Non-Resident Indians, s. 13-B does not dilutethe rights of tenants – It gives a chance to the tenants on merits toestablish their case and when justified and necessary to take thematter to trial – Thus, s. 13-B cannot be held to be arbitrary andunreasonable.s. 13-B – s. 13-B classifying non-Resident Indian landlordsas a separate category – Validity of Section 13-B – Held: Section13-B cannot be treated as an arbitrary classification that infringesand violates Article 14 – It cannot be held to be unconstitutionalbecause it grants a right to claim eviction for bona fide need bysummary procedure to a certain group of landlords-Non-Resident Indians subject to and on the satisfaction of statutory conditionswhich incorporate a check on frivolous evictions – It rests withthe legislature to make laws and extend it to other similarly situatedpersons – Rent Act(s) invariably give similar rights by a controlledmechanism and alluded riders to various other classes/groups oflandlords, namely, government servants, members of armed forces,the retired or soon to retire employees of the Central and the StateGovernments, widows, etc – Constitution of India – Art.14.s. 13-B – Restrictions and conditions imposed on landlordseeking eviction under – Purpose of – Held: In terms of Section13-B, the condition imposed upon the landlord is that he shouldhave been the owner of the premises for five years before theeviction petition is filed – Such landlord/owner is permitted to filean eviction petition only once during the lifetime and in respect ofone building – Landlord cannot sell or give the premises on leasefor a period of five years from the date of taking possession fromthe tenant – On breach of the same, the tenant has a right to seekrestoration of possession – In case the landlord does not occupythe premises for a continuous period of three months after gettingan eviction order or lets out the whole or any part of the premisesto a third person other than the tenant in contravention of theprovisions of s. 13 B(3), punishment is imposed-– Thus, theserestrictions and conditions are strong in-built checks to ensure thatthe need of the landlord should be genuine and bona fide and thetenant should not be subjected to frivolous and dubious evictionorder by relying on false assertions.s.18-A and s.13-B – Right of Non-Resident Indians to initiateeviction under the summary procedure – Nature of – Held: Is notan unfettered and absolute right – It is subject to satisfaction ofvarious pre-requisites and imperatives that ensure and checkpotential abuse by resorting to a short-circui t procedure –Requirement should arise from a genuine need of the Non-ResidentIndian landlord or his dependent – Furthermore, thesepre-conditions and post possession restrictions stated thereinsuggest that s. 13-B serves a specific policy objective to ensurethe right of Non-Resident Indians to occupy their property in theUnion Territory of Chandigarh and the State of Punjab as the casemay be, after “returning” to their country – This right has to bebalanced with the right of the tenants to establish their case on merits by disproving the genuine requirement of the Non-ResidentIndians – Constitution of India – Art. 14.Doctrines/Principles: Doctrine of Pith and substance –Meaning of – Held: Pith and substance doctrine states that if thelegislation is covered by an entry, that is, it is within the permittedjurisdiction of the legislature, any incidental encroachment in therival field has to be disregarded – Only when wide constructionof an entry leads to heads-on-clash with another entry in the sameor different List, the principle of harmonious construction isapplied to reconcile the conflict and to give effect to each of them.Constitution of India: Art. 254 – Repugnancy – Whenattracted – Held: Repugnancy arises between a Central and a StateAct when there is a direct and irreconcilable conflict between thetwo enactments and in that case, the Central Legislation prevailsby virtue of Art. 254 – Such repugnancy or inconsistency is not tobe readily inferred as the entries in the three Lists permit incidentalencroachment – Thus, every attempt must be made to placate theconflict and only when and in case of oppugnant clash, the

sections(inserted in the Rent Act vide East Punjab Urban Rent Restriction(Amendment) Act, 2001) to the Union Territory of Chandigarh –Provision of s. 13-B giving preferential right to claim eviction tonon-resident Indian – Constitutional validity of s. 13-B – Held:Section 13-B is constitutional valid as also its extension andapplicability to the Union Territory of Chandigarh – East PunjabUrban Rent Restriction (Amendment) Act , 2001 – PunjabRe-organisation Act, 1966 – s. 87.s. 13-B – Issuance of Notification dated 09.10.2009, u/s. 87of the Re-organisation Act, extending Section 13-B in theAmendment Act to the Union Territory of Chandigarh by executiveaction – Validity of – Held: Extension of the Amendment Act to theUnion Territory of Chandigarh falls within the ambit of conditionaldelegat ion and is valid and permissible – Once a policy ofextension of laws has been laid down by the Parliament and isclear and permissible, it would only seem as an inevitable falloutthat the executive should be permitted to extend future amendmentsto the existing laws – Thus, the challenge predicated on thedoctrine of excessive delegation, separation of powers, doctrineof the law of agency, cannot be accepted – Administrative law –Conditional delegation – East Punjab Urban Rent Restriction(Amendment) Act, 2001 – Punjab Re-organisation Act, 1966 –s. 87 s. 13-B – Amendments made vide the Amendment Act withregard to the rights of Non-Resident Indians by the State Legislatureof Punjab – Legislative competence of the State – Held:Amendment Act enacted by the State legislature was well within itscompetence – Amendment Act on its true construction and byreference to the doctrine of “pith and substance” is relatable tothe relat ionship of landlord and tenant for housing andaccommodation and falls under the Concurrent List – Dominantintention or “pith and substance” of the legislation is to regulatethe relationship between Non-Resident Indian landlords and tenantsfor housing and accommodation – Merely because the AmendmentAct to achieve its object touches upon the subject matter in respectof Non-Resident Indian landlords in the Rent Act, does not makethe Amendment or the Rent Act ultra vires the Constitution – In thecontext of the Union Territory of Chandigarh and as the subjectmatter falls within the Concurrent List, it would be immaterial todecide on the competence of the legislating body – Power to makelaws in respect of a Union Territory vests with the Parliament underArt.246(4) – In terms of s. 87 of the Re-organisation Act, the powerto extend laws to the Union Territory of Chandigarh vests with theCentral Government, that is the Parliament or the CentralExecutive, as the case may be, and is permissible – Constitutionof India – Art. 246(4) – East Punjab Urban Rent Restriction(Amendment) Act, 2001 – Punjab Re-organisation Act, 1966 –s. 87. s. 13-B – Plea that s. 13-B creates a special class of NRIlandlords, however, does not afford any legal remedy to the tenants– Reasonability of – Held: By providing for a simplified procedureof eviction by the Non-Resident Indians, s. 13-B does not dilutethe rights of tenants – It gives a chance to the tenants on merits toestablish their case and when justified and necessary to take thematter to trial – Thus, s. 13-B cannot be held to be arbitrary andunreasonable.s. 13-B – s. 13-B classifying non-Resident Indian landlordsas a separate category – Validity of Section 13-B – Held: Section13-B cannot be treated as an arbitrary classification that infringesand violates Article 14 – It cannot be held to be unconstitutionalbecause it grants a right to claim eviction for bona fide need bysummary procedure to a certain group of landlords-Non-Resident Indians subject to and on the satisfaction of statutory conditionswhich incorporate a check on frivolous evictions – It rests withthe legislature to make laws and extend it to other similarly situatedpersons – Rent Act(s) invariably give similar rights by a controlledmechanism and alluded riders to various other classes/groups oflandlords, namely, government servants, members of armed forces,the retired or soon to retire employees of the Central and the StateGovernments, widows, etc – Constitution of India – Art.14.s. 13-B – Restrictions and conditions imposed on landlordseeking eviction under – Purpose of – Held: In terms of Section13-B, the condition imposed upon the landlord is that he shouldhave been the owner of the premises for five years before theeviction petition is filed – Such landlord/owner is permitted to filean eviction petition only once during the lifetime and in respect ofone building – Landlord cannot sell or give the premises on leasefor a period of five years from the date of taking possession fromthe tenant – On breach of the same, the tenant has a right to seekrestoration of possession – In case the landlord does not occupythe premises for a continuous period of three months after gettingan eviction order or lets out the whole or any part of the premisesto a third person other than the tenant in contravention of theprovisions of s. 13 B(3), punishment is imposed-– Thus, theserestrictions and conditions are strong in-built checks to ensure thatthe need of the landlord should be genuine and bona fide and thetenant should not be subjected to frivolous and dubious evictionorder by relying on false assertions.s.18-A and s.13-B – Right of Non-Resident Indians to initiateeviction under the summary procedure – Nature of – Held: Is notan unfettered and absolute right – It is subject to satisfaction ofvarious pre-requisites and imperatives that ensure and checkpotential abuse by resorting to a short-circui t procedure –Requirement should arise from a genuine need of the Non-ResidentIndian landlord or his dependent – Furthermore, thesepre-conditions and post possession restrictions stated thereinsuggest that s. 13-B serves a specific policy objective to ensurethe right of Non-Resident Indians to occupy their property in theUnion Territory of Chandigarh and the State of Punjab as the casemay be, after “returning” to their country – This right has to bebalanced with the right of the tenants to establish their case on merits by disproving the genuine requirement of the Non-ResidentIndians – Constitution of India – Art. 14.Doctrines/Principles: Doctrine of Pith and substance –Meaning of – Held: Pith and substance doctrine states that if thelegislation is covered by an entry, that is, it is within the permittedjurisdiction of the legislature, any incidental encroachment in therival field has to be disregarded – Only when wide constructionof an entry leads to heads-on-clash with another entry in the sameor different List, the principle of harmonious construction isapplied to reconcile the conflict and to give effect to each of them.Constitution of India: Art. 254 – Repugnancy – Whenattracted – Held: Repugnancy arises between a Central and a StateAct when there is a direct and irreconcilable conflict between thetwo enactments and in that case, the Central Legislation prevailsby virtue of Art. 254 – Such repugnancy or inconsistency is not tobe readily inferred as the entries in the three Lists permit incidentalencroachment – Thus, every attempt must be made to placate theconflict and only when and in case of oppugnant clash, the courtshould proceed to strike down the legislation as trespassing beyondits legitimate and legal confines.Legislature: Function of – Held: Primary function of thelegislature is to make laws for all or different groups or classes ofpersons – Lawmakers as elected representatives are in a betterposition to know the needs, requirements and expectations ofcitizens – Thus, the legislature possesses the power to distinguishand classify persons or things subjected to such laws – Such aclassification, however, must pass the muster of Art. 14 whichproscribe hostile and invidious discrimination – Art. 14 does notentirely prohibit classification by grouping certain persons withspecial peculiarities in a special category to meet certain specificends.Legislation: Rent control legislation – Object of –

sections(inserted in the Rent Act vide East Punjab Urban Rent Restriction(Amendment) Act, 2001) to the Union Territory of Chandigarh –Provision of s. 13-B giving preferential right to claim eviction tonon-resident Indian – Constitutional validity of s. 13-B – Held:Section 13-B is constitutional valid as also its extension andapplicability to the Union Territory of Chandigarh – East PunjabUrban Rent Restriction (Amendment) Act , 2001 – PunjabRe-organisation Act, 1966 – s. 87.s. 13-B – Issuance of Notification dated 09.10.2009, u/s. 87of the Re-organisation Act, extending Section 13-B in theAmendment Act to the Union Territory of Chandigarh by executiveaction – Validity of – Held: Extension of the Amendment Act to theUnion Territory of Chandigarh falls within the ambit of conditionaldelegat ion and is valid and permissible – Once a policy ofextension of laws has been laid down by the Parliament and isclear and permissible, it would only seem as an inevitable falloutthat the executive should be permitted to extend future amendmentsto the existing laws – Thus, the challenge predicated on thedoctrine of excessive delegation, separation of powers, doctrineof the law of agency, cannot be accepted – Administrative law –Conditional delegation – East Punjab Urban Rent Restriction(Amendment) Act, 2001 – Punjab Re-organisation Act, 1966 –s. 87 s. 13-B – Amendments made vide the Amendment Act withregard to the rights of Non-Resident Indians by the State Legislatureof Punjab – Legislative competence of the State – Held:Amendment Act enacted by the State legislature was well within itscompetence – Amendment Act on its true construction and byreference to the doctrine of “pith and substance” is relatable tothe relat ionship of landlord and tenant for housing andaccommodation and falls under the Concurrent List – Dominantintention or “pith and substance” of the legislation is to regulatethe relationship between Non-Resident Indian landlords and tenantsfor housing and accommodation – Merely because the AmendmentAct to achieve its object touches upon the subject matter in respectof Non-Resident Indian landlords in the Rent Act, does not makethe Amendment or the Rent Act ultra vires the Constitution – In thecontext of the Union Territory of Chandigarh and as the subjectmatter falls within the Concurrent List, it would be immaterial todecide on the competence of the legislating body – Power to makelaws in respect of a Union Territory vests with the Parliament underArt.246(4) – In terms of s. 87 of the Re-organisation Act, the powerto extend laws to the Union Territory of Chandigarh vests with theCentral Government, that is the Parliament or the CentralExecutive, as the case may be, and is permissible – Constitutionof India – Art. 246(4) – East Punjab Urban Rent Restriction(Amendment) Act, 2001 – Punjab Re-organisation Act, 1966 –s. 87. s. 13-B – Plea that s. 13-B creates a special class of NRIlandlords, however, does not afford any legal remedy to the tenants– Reasonability of – Held: By providing for a simplified procedureof eviction by the Non-Resident Indians, s. 13-B does not dilutethe rights of tenants – It gives a chance to the tenants on merits toestablish their case and when justified and necessary to take thematter to trial – Thus, s. 13-B cannot be held to be arbitrary andunreasonable.s. 13-B – s. 13-B classifying non-Resident Indian landlordsas a separate category – Validity of Section 13-B – Held: Section13-B cannot be treated as an arbitrary classification that infringesand violates Article 14 – It cannot be held to be unconstitutionalbecause it grants a right to claim eviction for bona fide need bysummary procedure to a certain group of landlords-Non-Resident Indians subject to and on the satisfaction of statutory conditionswhich incorporate a check on frivolous evictions – It rests withthe legislature to make laws and extend it to other similarly situatedpersons – Rent Act(s) invariably give similar rights by a controlledmechanism and alluded riders to various other classes/groups oflandlords, namely, government servants, members of armed forces,the retired or soon to retire employees of the Central and the StateGovernments, widows, etc – Constitution of India – Art.14.s. 13-B – Restrictions and conditions imposed on landlordseeking eviction under – Purpose of – Held: In terms of Section13-B, the condition imposed upon the landlord is that he shouldhave been the owner of the premises for five years before theeviction petition is filed – Such landlord/owner is permitted to filean eviction petition only once during the lifetime and in respect ofone building – Landlord cannot sell or give the premises on leasefor a period of five years from the date of taking possession fromthe tenant – On breach of the same, the tenant has a right to seekrestoration of possession – In case the landlord does not occupythe premises for a continuous period of three months after gettingan eviction order or lets out the whole or any part of the premisesto a third person other than the tenant in contravention of theprovisions of s. 13 B(3), punishment is imposed-– Thus, theserestrictions and conditions are strong in-built checks to ensure thatthe need of the landlord should be genuine and bona fide and thetenant should not be subjected to frivolous and dubious evictionorder by relying on false assertions.s.18-A and s.13-B – Right of Non-Resident Indians to initiateeviction under the summary procedure – Nature of – Held: Is notan unfettered and absolute right – It is subject to satisfaction ofvarious pre-requisites and imperatives that ensure and checkpotential abuse by resorting to a short-circui t procedure –Requirement should arise from a genuine need of the Non-ResidentIndian landlord or his dependent – Furthermore, thesepre-conditions and post possession restrictions stated thereinsuggest that s. 13-B serves a specific policy objective to ensurethe right of Non-Resident Indians to occupy their property in theUnion Territory of Chandigarh and the State of Punjab as the casemay be, after “returning” to their country – This right has to bebalanced with the right of the tenants to establish their case on merits by disproving the genuine requirement of the Non-ResidentIndians – Constitution of India – Art. 14.Doctrines/Principles: Doctrine of Pith and substance –Meaning of – Held: Pith and substance doctrine states that if thelegislation is covered by an entry, that is, it is within the permittedjurisdiction of the legislature, any incidental encroachment in therival field has to be disregarded – Only when wide constructionof an entry leads to heads-on-clash with another entry in the sameor different List, the principle of harmonious construction isapplied to reconcile the conflict and to give effect to each of them.Constitution of India: Art. 254 – Repugnancy – Whenattracted – Held: Repugnancy arises between a Central and a StateAct when there is a direct and irreconcilable conflict between thetwo enactments and in that case, the Central Legislation prevailsby virtue of Art. 254 – Such repugnancy or inconsistency is not tobe readily inferred as the entries in the three Lists permit incidentalencroachment – Thus, every attempt must be made to placate theconflict and only when and in case of oppugnant clash, the courtshould proceed to strike down the legislation as trespassing beyondits legitimate and legal confines.Legislature: Function of – Held: Primary function of thelegislature is to make laws for all or different groups or classes ofpersons – Lawmakers as elected representatives are in a betterposition to know the needs, requirements and expectations ofcitizens – Thus, the legislature possesses the power to distinguishand classify persons or things subjected to such laws – Such aclassification, however, must pass the muster of Art. 14 whichproscribe hostile and invidious discrimination – Art. 14 does notentirely prohibit classification by grouping certain persons withspecial peculiarities in a special category to meet certain specificends.Legislation: Rent control legislation – Object of –

sections(inserted in the Rent Act vide East Punjab Urban Rent Restriction(Amendment) Act, 2001) to the Union Territory of Chandigarh –Provision of s. 13-B giving preferential right to claim eviction tonon-resident Indian – Constitutional validity of s. 13-B – Held:Section 13-B is constitutional valid as also its extension andapplicability to the Union Territory of Chandigarh – East PunjabUrban Rent Restriction (Amendment) Act , 2001 – PunjabRe-organisation Act, 1966 – s. 87.s. 13-B – Issuance of Notification dated 09.10.2009, u/s. 87of the Re-organisation Act, extending Section 13-B in theAmendment Act to the Union Territory of Chandigarh by executiveaction – Validity of – Held: Extension of the Amendment Act to theUnion Territory of Chandigarh falls within the ambit of conditionaldelegat ion and is valid and permissible – Once a policy ofextension of laws has been laid down by the Parliament and isclear and permissible, it would only seem as an inevitable falloutthat the executive should be permitted to extend future amendmentsto the existing laws – Thus, the challenge predicated on thedoctrine of excessive delegation, separation of powers, doctrineof the law of agency, cannot be accepted – Administrative law –Conditional delegation – East Punjab Urban Rent Restriction(Amendment) Act, 2001 – Punjab Re-organisation Act, 1966 –s. 87 s. 13-B – Amendments made vide the Amendment Act withregard to the rights of Non-Resident Indians by the State Legislatureof Punjab – Legislative competence of the State – Held:Amendment Act enacted by the State legislature was well within itscompetence – Amendment Act on its true construction and byreference to the doctrine of “pith and substance” is relatable tothe relat ionship of landlord and tenant for housing andaccommodation and falls under the Concurrent List – Dominantintention or “pith and substance” of the legislation is to regulatethe relationship between Non-Resident Indian landlords and tenantsfor housing and accommodation – Merely because the AmendmentAct to achieve its object touches upon the subject matter in respectof Non-Resident Indian landlords in the Rent Act, does not makethe Amendment or the Rent Act ultra vires the Constitution – In thecontext of the Union Territory of Chandigarh and as the subjectmatter falls within the Concurrent List, it would be immaterial todecide on the competence of the legislating body – Power to makelaws in respect of a Union Territory vests with the Parliament underArt.246(4) – In terms of s. 87 of the Re-organisation Act, the powerto extend laws to the Union Territory of Chandigarh vests with theCentral Government, that is the Parliament or the CentralExecutive, as the case may be, and is permissible – Constitutionof India – Art. 246(4) – East Punjab Urban Rent Restriction(Amendment) Act, 2001 – Punjab Re-organisation Act, 1966 –s. 87. s. 13-B – Plea that s. 13-B creates a special class of NRIlandlords, however, does not afford any legal remedy to the tenants– Reasonability of – Held: By providing for a simplified procedureof eviction by the Non-Resident Indians, s. 13-B does not dilutethe rights of tenants – It gives a chance to the tenants on merits toestablish their case and when justified and necessary to take thematter to trial – Thus, s. 13-B cannot be held to be arbitrary andunreasonable.s. 13-B – s. 13-B classifying non-Resident Indian landlordsas a separate category – Validity of Section 13-B – Held: Section13-B cannot be treated as an arbitrary classification that infringesand violates Article 14 – It cannot be held to be unconstitutionalbecause it grants a right to claim eviction for bona fide need bysummary procedure to a certain group of landlords-Non-Resident Indians subject to and on the satisfaction of statutory conditionswhich incorporate a check on frivolous evictions – It rests withthe legislature to make laws and extend it to other similarly situatedpersons – Rent Act(s) invariably give similar rights by a controlledmechanism and alluded riders to various other classes/groups oflandlords, namely, government servants, members of armed forces,the retired or soon to retire employees of the Central and the StateGovernments, widows, etc – Constitution of India – Art.14.s. 13-B – Restrictions and conditions imposed on landlordseeking eviction under – Purpose of – Held: In terms of Section13-B, the condition imposed upon the landlord is that he shouldhave been the owner of the premises for five years before theeviction petition is filed – Such landlord/owner is permitted to filean eviction petition only once during the lifetime and in respect ofone building – Landlord cannot sell or give the premises on leasefor a period of five years from the date of taking possession fromthe tenant – On breach of the same, the tenant has a right to seekrestoration of possession – In case the landlord does not occupythe premises for a continuous period of three months after gettingan eviction order or lets out the whole or any part of the premisesto a third person other than the tenant in contravention of theprovisions of s. 13 B(3), punishment is imposed-– Thus, theserestrictions and conditions are strong in-built checks to ensure thatthe need of the landlord should be genuine and bona fide and thetenant should not be subjected to frivolous and dubious evictionorder by relying on false assertions.s.18-A and s.13-B – Right of Non-Resident Indians to initiateeviction under the summary procedure – Nature of – Held: Is notan unfettered and absolute right – It is subject to satisfaction ofvarious pre-requisites and imperatives that ensure and checkpotential abuse by resorting to a short-circui t procedure –Requirement should arise from a genuine need of the Non-ResidentIndian landlord or his dependent – Furthermore, thesepre-conditions and post possession restrictions stated thereinsuggest that s. 13-B serves a specific policy objective to ensurethe right of Non-Resident Indians to occupy their property in theUnion Territory of Chandigarh and the State of Punjab as the casemay be, after “returning” to their country – This right has to bebalanced with the right of the tenants to establish their case on merits by disproving the genuine requirement of the Non-ResidentIndians – Constitution of India – Art. 14.Doctrines/Principles: Doctrine of Pith and substance –Meaning of – Held: Pith and substance doctrine states that if thelegislation is covered by an entry, that is, it is within the permittedjurisdiction of the legislature, any incidental encroachment in therival field has to be disregarded – Only when wide constructionof an entry leads to heads-on-clash with another entry in the sameor different List, the principle of harmonious construction isapplied to reconcile the conflict and to give effect to each of them.Constitution of India: Art. 254 – Repugnancy – Whenattracted – Held: Repugnancy arises between a Central and a StateAct when there is a direct and irreconcilable conflict between thetwo enactments and in that case, the Central Legislation prevailsby virtue of Art. 254 – Such repugnancy or inconsistency is not tobe readily inferred as the entries in the three Lists permit incidentalencroachment – Thus, every attempt must be made to placate theconflict and only when and in case of oppugnant clash, the courtshould proceed to strike down the legislation as trespassing beyondits legitimate and legal confines.Legislature: Function of – Held: Primary function of thelegislature is to make laws for all or different groups or classes ofpersons – Lawmakers as elected representatives are in a betterposition to know the needs, requirements and expectations ofcitizens – Thus, the legislature possesses the power to distinguishand classify persons or things subjected to such laws – Such aclassification, however, must pass the muster of Art. 14 whichproscribe hostile and invidious discrimination – Art. 14 does notentirely prohibit classification by grouping certain persons withspecial peculiarities in a special category to meet certain specificends.Legislation: Rent control legislation – Object of –

sections(inserted in the Rent Act vide East Punjab Urban Rent Restriction(Amendment) Act, 2001) to the Union Territory of Chandigarh –Provision of s. 13-B giving preferential right to claim eviction tonon-resident Indian – Constitutional validity of s. 13-B – Held:Section 13-B is constitutional valid as also its extension andapplicability to the Union Territory of Chandigarh – East PunjabUrban Rent Restriction (Amendment) Act , 2001 – PunjabRe-organisation Act, 1966 – s. 87.s. 13-B – Issuance of Notification dated 09.10.2009, u/s. 87of the Re-organisation Act, extending Section 13-B in theAmendment Act to the Union Territory of Chandigarh by executiveaction – Validity of – Held: Extension of the Amendment Act to theUnion Territory of Chandigarh falls within the ambit of conditionaldelegat ion and is valid and permissible – Once a policy ofextension of laws has been laid down by the Parliament and isclear and permissible, it would only seem as an inevitable falloutthat the executive should be permitted to extend future amendmentsto the existing laws – Thus, the challenge predicated on thedoctrine of excessive delegation, separation of powers, doctrineof the law of agency, cannot be accepted – Administrative law –Conditional delegation – East Punjab Urban Rent Restriction(Amendment) Act, 2001 – Punjab Re-organisation Act, 1966 –s. 87 s. 13-B – Amendments made vide the Amendment Act withregard to the rights of Non-Resident Indians by the State Legislatureof Punjab – Legislative competence of the State – Held:Amendment Act enacted by the State legislature was well within itscompetence – Amendment Act on its true construction and byreference to the doctrine of “pith and substance” is relatable tothe relat ionship of landlord and tenant for housing andaccommodation and falls under the Concurrent List – Dominantintention or “pith and substance” of the legislation is to regulatethe relationship between Non-Resident Indian landlords and tenantsfor housing and accommodation – Merely because the AmendmentAct to achieve its object touches upon the subject matter in respectof Non-Resident Indian landlords in the Rent Act, does not makethe Amendment or the Rent Act ultra vires the Constitution – In thecontext of the Union Territory of Chandigarh and as the subjectmatter falls within the Concurrent List, it would be immaterial todecide on the competence of the legislating body – Power to makelaws in respect of a Union Territory vests with the Parliament underArt.246(4) – In terms of s. 87 of the Re-organisation Act, the powerto extend laws to the Union Territory of Chandigarh vests with theCentral Government, that is the Parliament or the CentralExecutive, as the case may be, and is permissible – Constitutionof India – Art. 246(4) – East Punjab Urban Rent Restriction(Amendment) Act, 2001 – Punjab Re-organisation Act, 1966 –s. 87. s. 13-B – Plea that s. 13-B creates a special class of NRIlandlords, however, does not afford any legal remedy to the tenants– Reasonability of – Held: By providing for a simplified procedureof eviction by the Non-Resident Indians, s. 13-B does not dilutethe rights of tenants – It gives a chance to the tenants on merits toestablish their case and when justified and necessary to take thematter to trial – Thus, s. 13-B cannot be held to be arbitrary andunreasonable.s. 13-B – s. 13-B classifying non-Resident Indian landlordsas a separate category – Validity of Section 13-B – Held: Section13-B cannot be treated as an arbitrary classification that infringesand violates Article 14 – It cannot be held to be unconstitutionalbecause it grants a right to claim eviction for bona fide need bysummary procedure to a certain group of landlords-Non-Resident Indians subject to and on the satisfaction of statutory conditionswhich incorporate a check on frivolous evictions – It rests withthe legislature to make laws and extend it to other similarly situatedpersons – Rent Act(s) invariably give similar rights by a controlledmechanism and alluded riders to various other classes/groups oflandlords, namely, government servants, members of armed forces,the retired or soon to retire employees of the Central and the StateGovernments, widows, etc – Constitution of India – Art.14.s. 13-B – Restrictions and conditions imposed on landlordseeking eviction under – Purpose of – Held: In terms of Section13-B, the condition imposed upon the landlord is that he shouldhave been the owner of the premises for five years before theeviction petition is filed – Such landlord/owner is permitted to filean eviction petition only once during the lifetime and in respect ofone building – Landlord cannot sell or give the premises on leasefor a period of five years from the date of taking possession fromthe tenant – On breach of the same, the tenant has a right to seekrestoration of possession – In case the landlord does not occupythe premises for a continuous period of three months after gettingan eviction order or lets out the whole or any part of the premisesto a third person other than the tenant in contravention of theprovisions of s. 13 B(3), punishment is imposed-– Thus, theserestrictions and conditions are strong in-built checks to ensure thatthe need of the landlord should be genuine and bona fide and thetenant should not be subjected to frivolous and dubious evictionorder by relying on false assertions.s.18-A and s.13-B – Right of Non-Resident Indians to initiateeviction under the summary procedure – Nature of – Held: Is notan unfettered and absolute right – It is subject to satisfaction ofvarious pre-requisites and imperatives that ensure and checkpotential abuse by resorting to a short-circui t procedure –Requirement should arise from a genuine need of the Non-ResidentIndian landlord or his dependent – Furthermore, thesepre-conditions and post possession restrictions stated thereinsuggest that s. 13-B serves a specific policy objective to ensurethe right of Non-Resident Indians to occupy their property in theUnion Territory of Chandigarh and the State of Punjab as the casemay be, after “returning” to their country – This right has to bebalanced with the right of the tenants to establish their case on merits by disproving the genuine requirement of the Non-ResidentIndians – Constitution of India – Art. 14.Doctrines/Principles: Doctrine of Pith and substance –Meaning of – Held: Pith and substance doctrine states that if thelegislation is covered by an entry, that is, it is within the permittedjurisdiction of the legislature, any incidental encroachment in therival field has to be disregarded – Only when wide constructionof an entry leads to heads-on-clash with another entry in the sameor different List, the principle of harmonious construction isapplied to reconcile the conflict and to give effect to each of them.Constitution of India: Art. 254 – Repugnancy – Whenattracted – Held: Repugnancy arises between a Central and a StateAct when there is a direct and irreconcilable conflict between thetwo enactments and in that case, the Central Legislation prevailsby virtue of Art. 254 – Such repugnancy or inconsistency is not tobe readily inferred as the entries in the three Lists permit incidentalencroachment – Thus, every attempt must be made to placate theconflict and only when and in case of oppugnant clash, the courtshould proceed to strike down the legislation as trespassing beyondits legitimate and legal confines.Legislature: Function of – Held: Primary function of thelegislature is to make laws for all or different groups or classes ofpersons – Lawmakers as elected representatives are in a betterposition to know the needs, requirements and expectations ofcitizens – Thus, the legislature possesses the power to distinguishand classify persons or things subjected to such laws – Such aclassification, however, must pass the muster of Art. 14 whichproscribe hostile and invidious discrimination – Art. 14 does notentirely prohibit classification by grouping certain persons withspecial peculiarities in a special category to meet certain specificends.Legislation: Rent control legislation – Object of –

sections(inserted in the Rent Act vide East Punjab Urban Rent Restriction(Amendment) Act, 2001) to the Union Territory of Chandigarh –Provision of s. 13-B giving preferential right to claim eviction tonon-resident Indian – Constitutional validity of s. 13-B – Held:Section 13-B is constitutional valid as also its extension andapplicability to the Union Territory of Chandigarh – East PunjabUrban Rent Restriction (Amendment) Act , 2001 – PunjabRe-organisation Act, 1966 – s. 87.s. 13-B – Issuance of Notification dated 09.10.2009, u/s. 87of the Re-organisation Act, extending Section 13-B in theAmendment Act to the Union Territory of Chandigarh by executiveaction – Validity of – Held: Extension of the Amendment Act to theUnion Territory of Chandigarh falls within the ambit of conditionaldelegat ion and is valid and permissible – Once a policy ofextension of laws has been laid down by the Parliament and isclear and permissible, it would only seem as an inevitable falloutthat the executive should be permitted to extend future amendmentsto the existing laws – Thus, the challenge predicated on thedoctrine of excessive delegation, separation of powers, doctrineof the law of agency, cannot be accepted – Administrative law –Conditional delegation – East Punjab Urban Rent Restriction(Amendment) Act, 2001 – Punjab Re-organisation Act, 1966 –s. 87 s. 13-B – Amendments made vide the Amendment Act withregard to the rights of Non-Resident Indians by the State Legislatureof Punjab – Legislative competence of the State – Held:Amendment Act enacted by the State legislature was well within itscompetence – Amendment Act on its true construction and byreference to the doctrine of “pith and substance” is relatable tothe relat ionship of landlord and tenant for housing andaccommodation and falls under the Concurrent List – Dominantintention or “pith and substance” of the legislation is to regulatethe relationship between Non-Resident Indian landlords and tenantsfor housing and accommodation – Merely because the AmendmentAct to achieve its object touches upon the subject matter in respectof Non-Resident Indian landlords in the Rent Act, does not makethe Amendment or the Rent Act ultra vires the Constitution – In thecontext of the Union Territory of Chandigarh and as the subjectmatter falls within the Concurrent List, it would be immaterial todecide on the competence of the legislating body – Power to makelaws in respect of a Union Territory vests with the Parliament underArt.246(4) – In terms of s. 87 of the Re-organisation Act, the powerto extend laws to the Union Territory of Chandigarh vests with theCentral Government, that is the Parliament or the CentralExecutive, as the case may be, and is permissible – Constitutionof India – Art. 246(4) – East Punjab Urban Rent Restriction(Amendment) Act, 2001 – Punjab Re-organisation Act, 1966 –s. 87. s. 13-B – Plea that s. 13-B creates a special class of NRIlandlords, however, does not afford any legal remedy to the tenants– Reasonability of – Held: By providing for a simplified procedureof eviction by the Non-Resident Indians, s. 13-B does not dilutethe rights of tenants – It gives a chance to the tenants on merits toestablish their case and when justified and necessary to take thematter to trial – Thus, s. 13-B cannot be held to be arbitrary andunreasonable.s. 13-B – s. 13-B classifying non-Resident Indian landlordsas a separate category – Validity of Section 13-B – Held: Section13-B cannot be treated as an arbitrary classification that infringesand violates Article 14 – It cannot be held to be unconstitutionalbecause it grants a right to claim eviction for bona fide need bysummary procedure to a certain group of landlords-Non-Resident Indians subject to and on the satisfaction of statutory conditionswhich incorporate a check on frivolous evictions – It rests withthe legislature to make laws and extend it to other similarly situatedpersons – Rent Act(s) invariably give similar rights by a controlledmechanism and alluded riders to various other classes/groups oflandlords, namely, government servants, members of armed forces,the retired or soon to retire employees of the Central and the StateGovernments, widows, etc – Constitution of India – Art.14.s. 13-B – Restrictions and conditions imposed on landlordseeking eviction under – Purpose of – Held: In terms of Section13-B, the condition imposed upon the landlord is that he shouldhave been the owner of the premises for five years before theeviction petition is filed – Such landlord/owner is permitted to filean eviction petition only once during the lifetime and in respect ofone building – Landlord cannot sell or give the premises on leasefor a period of five years from the date of taking possession fromthe tenant – On breach of the same, the tenant has a right to seekrestoration of possession – In case the landlord does not occupythe premises for a continuous period of three months after gettingan eviction order or lets out the whole or any part of the premisesto a third person other than the tenant in contravention of theprovisions of s. 13 B(3), punishment is imposed-– Thus, theserestrictions and conditions are strong in-built checks to ensure thatthe need of the landlord should be genuine and bona fide and thetenant should not be subjected to frivolous and dubious evictionorder by relying on false assertions.s.18-A and s.13-B – Right of Non-Resident Indians to initiateeviction under the summary procedure – Nature of – Held: Is notan unfettered and absolute right – It is subject to satisfaction ofvarious pre-requisites and imperatives that ensure and checkpotential abuse by resorting to a short-circui t procedure –Requirement should arise from a genuine need of the Non-ResidentIndian landlord or his dependent – Furthermore, thesepre-conditions and post possession restrictions stated thereinsuggest that s. 13-B serves a specific policy objective to ensurethe right of Non-Resident Indians to occupy their property in theUnion Territory of Chandigarh and the State of Punjab as the casemay be, after “returning” to their country – This right has to bebalanced with the right of the tenants to establish their case on merits by disproving the genuine requirement of the Non-ResidentIndians – Constitution of India – Art. 14.Doctrines/Principles: Doctrine of Pith and substance –Meaning of – Held: Pith and substance doctrine states that if thelegislation is covered by an entry, that is, it is within the permittedjurisdiction of the legislature, any incidental encroachment in therival field has to be disregarded – Only when wide constructionof an entry leads to heads-on-clash with another entry in the sameor different List, the principle of harmonious construction isapplied to reconcile the conflict and to give effect to each of them.Constitution of India: Art. 254 – Repugnancy – Whenattracted – Held: Repugnancy arises between a Central and a StateAct when there is a direct and irreconcilable conflict between thetwo enactments and in that case, the Central Legislation prevailsby virtue of Art. 254 – Such repugnancy or inconsistency is not tobe readily inferred as the entries in the three Lists permit incidentalencroachment – Thus, every attempt must be made to placate theconflict and only when and in case of oppugnant clash, the courtshould proceed to strike down the legislation as trespassing beyondits legitimate and legal confines.Legislature: Function of – Held: Primary function of thelegislature is to make laws for all or different groups or classes ofpersons – Lawmakers as elected representatives are in a betterposition to know the needs, requirements and expectations ofcitizens – Thus, the legislature possesses the power to distinguishand classify persons or things subjected to such laws – Such aclassification, however, must pass the muster of Art. 14 whichproscribe hostile and invidious discrimination – Art. 14 does notentirely prohibit classification by grouping certain persons withspecial peculiarities in a special category to meet certain specificends.Legislation: Rent control legislation – Object of –

sections(inserted in the Rent Act vide East Punjab Urban Rent Restriction(Amendment) Act, 2001) to the Union Territory of Chandigarh –Provision of s. 13-B giving preferential right to claim eviction tonon-resident Indian – Constitutional validity of s. 13-B – Held:Section 13-B is constitutional valid as also its extension andapplicability to the Union Territory of Chandigarh – East PunjabUrban Rent Restriction (Amendment) Act , 2001 – PunjabRe-organisation Act, 1966 – s. 87.s. 13-B – Issuance of Notification dated 09.10.2009, u/s. 87of the Re-organisation Act, extending Section 13-B in theAmendment Act to the Union Territory of Chandigarh by executiveaction – Validity of – Held: Extension of the Amendment Act to theUnion Territory of Chandigarh falls within the ambit of conditionaldelegat ion and is valid and permissible – Once a policy ofextension of laws has been laid down by the Parliament and isclear and permissible, it would only seem as an inevitable falloutthat the executive should be permitted to extend future amendmentsto the existing laws – Thus, the challenge predicated on thedoctrine of excessive delegation, separation of powers, doctrineof the law of agency, cannot be accepted – Administrative law –Conditional delegation – East Punjab Urban Rent Restriction(Amendment) Act, 2001 – Punjab Re-organisation Act, 1966 –s. 87 s. 13-B – Amendments made vide the Amendment Act withregard to the rights of Non-Resident Indians by the State Legislatureof Punjab – Legislative competence of the State – Held:Amendment Act enacted by the State legislature was well within itscompetence – Amendment Act on its true construction and byreference to the doctrine of “pith and substance” is relatable tothe relat ionship of landlord and tenant for housing andaccommodation and falls under the Concurrent List – Dominantintention or “pith and substance” of the legislation is to regulatethe relationship between Non-Resident Indian landlords and tenantsfor housing and accommodation – Merely because the AmendmentAct to achieve its object touches upon the subject matter in respectof Non-Resident Indian landlords in the Rent Act, does not makethe Amendment or the Rent Act ultra vires the Constitution – In thecontext of the Union Territory of Chandigarh and as the subjectmatter falls within the Concurrent List, it would be immaterial todecide on the competence of the legislating body – Power to makelaws in respect of a Union Territory vests with the Parliament underArt.246(4) – In terms of s. 87 of the Re-organisation Act, the powerto extend laws to the Union Territory of Chandigarh vests with theCentral Government, that is the Parliament or the CentralExecutive, as the case may be, and is permissible – Constitutionof India – Art. 246(4) – East Punjab Urban Rent Restriction(Amendment) Act, 2001 – Punjab Re-organisation Act, 1966 –s. 87. s. 13-B – Plea that s. 13-B creates a special class of NRIlandlords, however, does not afford any legal remedy to the tenants– Reasonability of – Held: By providing for a simplified procedureof eviction by the Non-Resident Indians, s. 13-B does not dilutethe rights of tenants – It gives a chance to the tenants on merits toestablish their case and when justified and necessary to take thematter to trial – Thus, s. 13-B cannot be held to be arbitrary andunreasonable.s. 13-B – s. 13-B classifying non-Resident Indian landlordsas a separate category – Validity of Section 13-B – Held: Section13-B cannot be treated as an arbitrary classification that infringesand violates Article 14 – It cannot be held to be unconstitutionalbecause it grants a right to claim eviction for bona fide need bysummary procedure to a certain group of landlords-Non-Resident Indians subject to and on the satisfaction of statutory conditionswhich incorporate a check on frivolous evictions – It rests withthe legislature to make laws and extend it to other similarly situatedpersons – Rent Act(s) invariably give similar rights by a controlledmechanism and alluded riders to various other classes/groups oflandlords, namely, government servants, members of armed forces,the retired or soon to retire employees of the Central and the StateGovernments, widows, etc – Constitution of India – Art.14.s. 13-B – Restrictions and conditions imposed on landlordseeking eviction under – Purpose of – Held: In terms of Section13-B, the condition imposed upon the landlord is that he shouldhave been the owner of the premises for five years before theeviction petition is filed – Such landlord/owner is permitted to filean eviction petition only once during the lifetime and in respect ofone building – Landlord cannot sell or give the premises on leasefor a period of five years from the date of taking possession fromthe tenant – On breach of the same, the tenant has a right to seekrestoration of possession – In case the landlord does not occupythe premises for a continuous period of three months after gettingan eviction order or lets out the whole or any part of the premisesto a third person other than the tenant in contravention of theprovisions of s. 13 B(3), punishment is imposed-– Thus, theserestrictions and conditions are strong in-built checks to ensure thatthe need of the landlord should be genuine and bona fide and thetenant should not be subjected to frivolous and dubious evictionorder by relying on false assertions.s.18-A and s.13-B – Right of Non-Resident Indians to initiateeviction under the summary procedure – Nature of – Held: Is notan unfettered and absolute right – It is subject to satisfaction ofvarious pre-requisites and imperatives that ensure and checkpotential abuse by resorting to a short-circui t procedure –Requirement should arise from a genuine need of the Non-ResidentIndian landlord or his dependent – Furthermore, thesepre-conditions and post possession restrictions stated thereinsuggest that s. 13-B serves a specific policy objective to ensurethe right of Non-Resident Indians to occupy their property in theUnion Territory of Chandigarh and the State of Punjab as the casemay be, after “returning” to their country – This right has to bebalanced with the right of the tenants to establish their case on merits by disproving the genuine requirement of the Non-ResidentIndians – Constitution of India – Art. 14.Doctrines/Principles: Doctrine of Pith and substance –Meaning of – Held: Pith and substance doctrine states that if thelegislation is covered by an entry, that is, it is within the permittedjurisdiction of the legislature, any incidental encroachment in therival field has to be disregarded – Only when wide constructionof an entry leads to heads-on-clash with another entry in the sameor different List, the principle of harmonious construction isapplied to reconcile the conflict and to give effect to each of them.Constitution of India: Art. 254 – Repugnancy – Whenattracted – Held: Repugnancy arises between a Central and a StateAct when there is a direct and irreconcilable conflict between thetwo enactments and in that case, the Central Legislation prevailsby virtue of Art. 254 – Such repugnancy or inconsistency is not tobe readily inferred as the entries in the three Lists permit incidentalencroachment – Thus, every attempt must be made to placate theconflict and only when and in case of oppugnant clash, the courtshould proceed to strike down the legislation as trespassing beyondits legitimate and legal confines.Legislature: Function of – Held: Primary function of thelegislature is to make laws for all or different groups or classes ofpersons – Lawmakers as elected representatives are in a betterposition to know the needs, requirements and expectations ofcitizens – Thus, the legislature possesses the power to distinguishand classify persons or things subjected to such laws – Such aclassification, however, must pass the muster of Art. 14 whichproscribe hostile and invidious discrimination – Art. 14 does notentirely prohibit classification by grouping certain persons withspecial peculiarities in a special category to meet certain specificends.Legislation: Rent control legislation – Object of –

VIII, r.6A regardingthe filing of counter-claim by defendant in suit – Answering thereference, held: Per N.V. Ramana, Mohan M. Shantanagoudar andAjay Rastogi, JJ. To avoid multiplicity of proceedings, the counterclaimby way of r.6A was inserted in the CPC by 1976 AmendmentAct – Or. VIII, r. 6A does not put an embargo on filing the counterclaimafter filing the written statement, rather the restriction is onlywith respect to the accrual of the cause of action– However, thisdoes not give absolute right to the defendant to file the counterclaimwith substantive delay, even if the limitation periodprescribed has not elapsed – Court has to take into considerationthe outer limit for filing the counter-claim which is pegged till theissues are framed, after evaluating inclusive factors, which are onlyillustrative and not exhaustive, viz., period of delay; prescribedlimitation period for the cause of action pleaded; reason for thedelay etc. – Per Mohan M. Shantanagoudar, J. (PartlySupplementing and Partly Dissenting) Court may exercise itsdiscretion and permit the filing of counter-claim after the writtenstatement, till the stage of framing of the issues of the trial –However, in exceptional circumstances, the subsequent filing ofcounter-claim may be permitted till the stage of commencement of recording of the evidence on behalf of the plaintiff as there is nosignificant development in the legal proceedings during theintervening period between framing of issues and commencementof recording of evidence – Code of Civil Procedure (Amendment)Act of 1976 – Code of Civil Procedure (Amendment) Act, 2002 –Limitation Act, 1963 – s.3(2)(b)(ii).Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 – Or.

(Supplementing) Conjoint and harmoniousreading of rr. 6A, 9 & 10 of Or. VIII and Or. VI, r. 17, CPC revealsthat the Court is vested with the discretion to allow the filing ofcounter-claim even after the filing of the written statement, as longas the same is within the limitation prescribed under the 1963 Act– Limitation Act, 1963.Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 – Or. VIII, r. 6A, 6B – Pleaof respondent, relying on r.6B, that r.6A(1) requires that the causeof action for counter-claim should arise before the filing of thewritten statement – Held: Per Mohan M. Shantanagoudar, J.(Supplementing) Not agreed with, for two reasons- (i) It is possiblethat at the time of filing the written statement, the defendant isunaware of the facts giving rise to the cause of action for hiscounter-claim (ii) perusal of Or.VIII, r. 6B suggests that it is onlylimited to cases where the counter-claim is made along with thewritten statement – Provisions u/Or.

VIII, r.6A regardingthe filing of counter-claim by defendant in suit – Answering thereference, held: Per N.V. Ramana, Mohan M. Shantanagoudar andAjay Rastogi, JJ. To avoid multiplicity of proceedings, the counterclaimby way of r.6A was inserted in the CPC by 1976 AmendmentAct – Or. VIII, r. 6A does not put an embargo on filing the counterclaimafter filing the written statement, rather the restriction is onlywith respect to the accrual of the cause of action– However, thisdoes not give absolute right to the defendant to file the counterclaimwith substantive delay, even if the limitation periodprescribed has not elapsed – Court has to take into considerationthe outer limit for filing the counter-claim which is pegged till theissues are framed, after evaluating inclusive factors, which are onlyillustrative and not exhaustive, viz., period of delay; prescribedlimitation period for the cause of action pleaded; reason for thedelay etc. – Per Mohan M. Shantanagoudar, J. (PartlySupplementing and Partly Dissenting) Court may exercise itsdiscretion and permit the filing of counter-claim after the writtenstatement, till the stage of framing of the issues of the trial –However, in exceptional circumstances, the subsequent filing ofcounter-claim may be permitted till the stage of commencement of recording of the evidence on behalf of the plaintiff as there is nosignificant development in the legal proceedings during theintervening period between framing of issues and commencementof recording of evidence – Code of Civil Procedure (Amendment)Act of 1976 – Code of Civil Procedure (Amendment) Act, 2002 –Limitation Act, 1963 – s.3(2)(b)(ii).Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 – Or.

(Supplementing) Conjoint and harmoniousreading of rr. 6A, 9 & 10 of Or. VIII and Or. VI, r. 17, CPC revealsthat the Court is vested with the discretion to allow the filing ofcounter-claim even after the filing of the written statement, as longas the same is within the limitation prescribed under the 1963 Act– Limitation Act, 1963.Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 – Or. VIII, r. 6A, 6B – Pleaof respondent, relying on r.6B, that r.6A(1) requires that the causeof action for counter-claim should arise before the filing of thewritten statement – Held: Per Mohan M. Shantanagoudar, J.(Supplementing) Not agreed with, for two reasons- (i) It is possiblethat at the time of filing the written statement, the defendant isunaware of the facts giving rise to the cause of action for hiscounter-claim (ii) perusal of Or.VIII, r. 6B suggests that it is onlylimited to cases where the counter-claim is made along with thewritten statement – Provisions u/Or. VIII should not be read inisolation, but in a conjoint and harmonious manner – Rule 6Bcannot be read as limitation on the Court’s discretion to permit thefiling of belated counter-claim Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 – Or.

To avoid multiplicity of proceedings, the counterclaimby way of r.6A was inserted in the CPC by 1976 AmendmentAct – Or. VIII, r. 6A does not put an embargo on filing the counterclaimafter filing the written statement, rather the restriction is onlywith respect to the accrual of the cause of action– However, thisdoes not give absolute right to the defendant to file the counterclaimwith substantive delay, even if the limitation periodprescribed has not elapsed – Court has to take into considerationthe outer limit for filing the counter-claim which is pegged till theissues are framed, after evaluating inclusive factors, which are onlyillustrative and not exhaustive, viz., period of delay; prescribedlimitation period for the cause of action pleaded; reason for thedelay etc. – Per Mohan M. Shantanagoudar, J. (PartlySupplementing and Partly Dissenting) Court may exercise itsdiscretion and permit the filing of counter-claim after the writtenstatement, till the stage of framing of the issues of the trial –However, in exceptional circumstances, the subsequent filing ofcounter-claim may be permitted till the stage of commencement of recording of the evidence on behalf of the plaintiff as there is nosignificant development in the legal proceedings during theintervening period between framing of issues and commencementof recording of evidence – Code of Civil Procedure (Amendment)Act of 1976 – Code of Civil Procedure (Amendment) Act, 2002 –Limitation Act, 1963 – s.3(2)(b)(ii).Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 – Or.

VIII, r. 6A, 6B – Pleaof respondent, relying on r.6B, that r.6A(1) requires that the causeof action for counter-claim should arise before the filing of thewritten statement – Held: Per Mohan M. Shantanagoudar, J.(Supplementing) Not agreed with, for two reasons- (i) It is possiblethat at the time of filing the written statement, the defendant isunaware of the facts giving rise to the cause of action for hiscounter-claim (ii) perusal of Or.VIII, r. 6B suggests that it is onlylimited to cases where the counter-claim is made along with thewritten statement – Provisions u/Or.

VIII, r.6A regardingthe filing of counter-claim by defendant in suit – Answering thereference, held: Per N.V. Ramana, Mohan M. Shantanagoudar andAjay Rastogi, JJ. To avoid multiplicity of proceedings, the counterclaimby way of r.6A was inserted in the CPC by 1976 AmendmentAct – Or. VIII, r. 6A does not put an embargo on filing the counterclaimafter filing the written statement, rather the restriction is onlywith respect to the accrual of the cause of action– However, thisdoes not give absolute right to the defendant to file the counterclaimwith substantive delay, even if the limitation periodprescribed has not elapsed – Court has to take into considerationthe outer limit for filing the counter-claim which is pegged till theissues are framed, after evaluating inclusive factors, which are onlyillustrative and not exhaustive, viz., period of delay; prescribedlimitation period for the cause of action pleaded; reason for thedelay etc. – Per Mohan M. Shantanagoudar, J. (PartlySupplementing and Partly Dissenting) Court may exercise itsdiscretion and permit the filing of counter-claim after the writtenstatement, till the stage of framing of the issues of the trial –However, in exceptional circumstances, the subsequent filing ofcounter-claim may be permitted till the stage of commencement of recording of the evidence on behalf of the plaintiff as there is nosignificant development in the legal proceedings during theintervening period between framing of issues and commencementof recording of evidence – Code of Civil Procedure (Amendment)Act of 1976 – Code of Civil Procedure (Amendment) Act, 2002 –Limitation Act, 1963 – s.3(2)(b)(ii).Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 – Or.

(Supplementing) Conjoint and harmoniousreading of rr. 6A, 9 & 10 of Or. VIII and Or. VI, r. 17, CPC revealsthat the Court is vested with the discretion to allow the filing ofcounter-claim even after the filing of the written statement, as longas the same is within the limitation prescribed under the 1963 Act– Limitation Act, 1963.Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 – Or. VIII, r. 6A, 6B – Pleaof respondent, relying on r.6B, that r.6A(1) requires that the causeof action for counter-claim should arise before the filing of thewritten statement – Held: Per Mohan M. Shantanagoudar, J.(Supplementing) Not agreed with, for two reasons- (i) It is possiblethat at the time of filing the written statement, the defendant isunaware of the facts giving rise to the cause of action for hiscounter-claim (ii) perusal of Or.VIII, r. 6B suggests that it is onlylimited to cases where the counter-claim is made along with thewritten statement – Provisions u/Or. VIII should not be read inisolation, but in a conjoint and harmonious manner – Rule 6Bcannot be read as limitation on the Court’s discretion to permit thefiling of belated counter-claim Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 – Or.

VIII, r.6A regardingthe filing of counter-claim by defendant in suit – Answering thereference, held: Per N.V. Ramana, Mohan M. Shantanagoudar andAjay Rastogi, JJ. To avoid multiplicity of proceedings, the counterclaimby way of r.6A was inserted in the CPC by 1976 AmendmentAct – Or. VIII, r. 6A does not put an embargo on filing the counterclaimafter filing the written statement, rather the restriction is onlywith respect to the accrual of the cause of action– However, thisdoes not give absolute right to the defendant to file the counterclaimwith substantive delay, even if the limitation periodprescribed has not elapsed – Court has to take into considerationthe outer limit for filing the counter-claim which is pegged till theissues are framed, after evaluating inclusive factors, which are onlyillustrative and not exhaustive, viz., period of delay; prescribedlimitation period for the cause of action pleaded; reason for thedelay etc. – Per Mohan M. Shantanagoudar, J. (PartlySupplementing and Partly Dissenting) Court may exercise itsdiscretion and permit the filing of counter-claim after the writtenstatement, till the stage of framing of the issues of the trial –However, in exceptional circumstances, the subsequent filing ofcounter-claim may be permitted till the stage of commencement of recording of the evidence on behalf of the plaintiff as there is nosignificant development in the legal proceedings during theintervening period between framing of issues and commencementof recording of evidence – Code of Civil Procedure (Amendment)Act of 1976 – Code of Civil Procedure (Amendment) Act, 2002 –Limitation Act, 1963 – s.3(2)(b)(ii).Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 – Or.

(Supplementing) Conjoint and harmoniousreading of rr. 6A, 9 & 10 of Or. VIII and Or. VI, r. 17, CPC revealsthat the Court is vested with the discretion to allow the filing ofcounter-claim even after the filing of the written statement, as longas the same is within the limitation prescribed under the 1963 Act– Limitation Act, 1963.Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 – Or. VIII, r. 6A, 6B – Pleaof respondent, relying on r.6B, that r.6A(1) requires that the causeof action for counter-claim should arise before the filing of thewritten statement – Held: Per Mohan M. Shantanagoudar, J.(Supplementing) Not agreed with, for two reasons- (i) It is possiblethat at the time of filing the written statement, the defendant isunaware of the facts giving rise to the cause of action for hiscounter-claim (ii) perusal of Or.VIII, r. 6B suggests that it is onlylimited to cases where the counter-claim is made along with thewritten statement – Provisions u/Or.
