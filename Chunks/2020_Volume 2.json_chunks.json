        "content": "  Conservation of Foreign Exchange and Prevention of Smuggling Activities Act, 1974: s.3(1) – Detention order made under s.3 by an officer specially empowered for that purpose by the Government – Whether the representation can independently be made to and must be considered by the Detaining Authority who is a special empowered officer of the concerned government and whether in certain circumstance the Detaining Authority ought to defer consideration of such representation till the report is received from the Advisory Board – Held: (Per Majority) Where the detention order is made inter alia under s.3 by an officer specially empowered for that purpose either by the Central Government or the State Government, the person detained has a right to make a representation to the said officer; and the said officer is obliged to consider the said representation; and the failure on his part to do so would result in denial of right conferred on the person detained to make a representation – A specially empowered officer who passes the order of detention, in exercise of special empowerment, has no statutory role to play at the stage when the report is received from the Advisory Board – The report is to be considered by the appropriate Government and not by the specially empowered officer – In terms of s.8, the report of the Advisory Board is meant only for the consumption of the appropriate Government and apart from the operative part of the report which is to be specified in a separate paragraph as per sub-section (c), the mandate in terms of sub-section (e) is to keep the report of the Advisory Board completely confidential – Thus, a specially empowered officer who may have passed the order of detention, by statutory intent is not to be privy to the report nor does the statute contemplate any role for such specially empowered officer at the stage of consideration of the opinion of vthe Advisory Board – Thus, the Detaining Authority is obliged to consider the representation without waiting for the opinion of the Central Advisory Board – In the instant case, there was no valid explanation for non-consideration of the representation of detenues from 27.11.2019 till 14.01.2020 – Therefore, complete inaction on part of the Detaining Authority in considering the representation caused prejudice to the detenues and violated their constitutional rights – Detention orders are quashed – (Dissenting - Per Hemant Gupta, J.) – s.3 empowers the Central Government, the State Government or the specially empowered officer to make an order, directing a person to be detained – Once the detention order has been made by any of the authorities competent to detain in terms of s.3(1), the representation to seek revocation of the detention order can be considered and decided by the Detaining Authority dehors the decision of the Advisory Board and the acceptance of recommendation by the appropriate Government – The consideration for revocation of a detention order is limited to examining whether the order conforms with the provisions of law whereas the recommendation of the Advisory Board is on the sufficiency of material for detention, which alone is either confirmed or not accepted by the appropriate Government – It would be a matter of prudence and propriety for the Detaining Authority to defer the decision on the representation to revoke the detention order, when the matter is being considered by the Advisory Board, consisting of three sitting Judges of the High Court – The consideration of the representation by the Detaining Authority in these circumstances cannot be said to be delayed as the representation was received after the matter was referred to the Advisory Board "

        "HeadNote": "  Maharashtra Village Panchayats Act, 1959: s.14B – Election of Gram Panchayat – Appellant elected as member of village Panchayat – Disqualification of appellant on account of non- submission of election expenses within the period prescribed – Held: A perusal of s.14B shows that the State Election Commission is to be satisfied as to whether a person has no good reason or justification for the failure to furnish account of election expenses – Secondly in terms of sub-section (2) for the reasons to be recorded, the disqualification under sub-section (1) can be removed or the period of disqualification can be reduced – In the instant case, explanation of appellant that he was advised bed rest on account of hypertension and diabetes which caused unintended delay in furnishing election expenses was not accepted – Collector passed order disqualifying the appellant for a period of five years to be member of Gram Panchayat – Appeal dismissed for the reason that the medical certificate was not issued by the Competent Authority – High Court while disposing of writ petition held that copy of medical certificate tendered by the appellant had no particulars such as name, diagnosis, date and reference number and the said certificate was issued by the private hospital bearing only a stamp of doctor and the said document cannot be relied upon and if the authorities did not accept it, there was no error in the said view – There is no reason to take a different view than the view affirmed by the High Court. Maharashtra Village Panchayats Act, 1959: s.14B – Plea of appellant was that there was delay of 15 days in submitting the election expenses and, therefore, disqualification for a period of five years was disproportionate to the default committed by her – Held: s.14B empowers the Election Commission to pass a just order of disqualification – The extent of period of disqualification has to be in proportion to the default – In the instant case, the order of disqualification for a period of five years was without taking into consideration the extent of default committed by the appellant – Such mechanical exercise of power without any adequate reasons, rendered the order of disqualification for a period of five years as illegal and untenable – Consequently, the order passed by the Collector and subsequent orders in appeal and in the writ petition are set aside in part to the extent of prescribing disqualification for a period of five years – Matter remitted to the Collector to take into consideration the period of delay/default, the purport for which the election expenses are sought to be furnished and that the order of disqualification operates from the date of the order including delay in passing the order of disqualification – Election laws. Maharashtra Village Panchayats Act, 1959: s.14B – Whether provision of s.14B, mandatory or directory – Held: In s.14B, there is no prohibitive or negative expressions used as it empowers the Election Commission to pass a just order of disqualification – Sub- section (1) of s.14B empowers the State Election Commission to pass an order of disqualification of a candidate, if the candidate fails to lodge account of election expenses for lack of good reason or without any justification – Such satisfaction is required to be recorded by the Election Commission – Since authority is vested with power to reduce the period of disqualification, therefore, makes the provision directory. Maharashatra Zilla Parishads and Panchayat Samitis Act, 1961: s.15B – Elections of Panchayat Samiti – Disqualification of appellant for contesting elections for the period of five years on account of non-submission of election expenses within period prescribed – Meanwhile, elections of Gram Panchayat were notified and appellant submitted his nomination for the post of Sarpanch – Objection against it was rejected by the Returning Officer and appellant was duly elected to the post of Sarpanch – Returning Officer held that disqualification was applicable only for the elections of Zilla Parishads and Panchayat Samitis and not for elections of Gram Panchayat – Order of Returning Officer rejecting objection challenged before High Court – Writ petition also filed by appellant challenging disqualification order passed by Collector – High Court dismissed writ petition of the appellant while writ petition filed by objector was partly allowed by setting aside the order passed by Returning officer rejecting the objections raised by him – On appeal, held: Art.243-O of the Constitution of India provides that no election to any panchayats shall be called in question except by an election petition presented to such authority and in such manner as provided for by or under any law made under the legislature of the State – The dispute in these appeals did not pertain to election to either House of the Parliament but to a local body – The constitutional bar is contained in Art.243-O of the Constitution of India in furtherance of which s.15A was inserted in the year 1994 – s.10A of the 1959 Act and s.9A of the 1961 Act read with Arts.243-K and 243-O, are pari materia with Art.324 of the Constitution of India – The remedy of an aggrieved person accepting or rejecting nomination of a candidate is by way of an election petition in view of the bar created under s.15A of the 1959 Act – The said Act is a complete Code providing machinery for redressal to the grievances pertaining to election as contained in s.15 of the 1959 Act – High Court though exercises extraordinary jurisdiction under Art.226 of the Constitution of India but such jurisdiction is discretionary in nature and may not be exercised in view of the fact that an efficacious alternative remedy is available and more so exercise restraint in terms of Art.243-O of the Constitution of India – Once alternate machinery is provided by the statute, the recourse to writ jurisdiction is not an appropriate remedy – It is a prudent discretion to be exercised by the High Court not to interfere in the election matters, especially after declaration of the results of the elections but relegate the parties to the remedy contemplated by the statute – In view of this, writ petition should not have been entertained by the High Court – However, the order of the High Court that the appellant has not furnished the election expenses incurred on the date of election did not warrant any interference – Constitution of India – Arts.243K, 243O and 324 – Election-Laws.

Offence where maximum sentence is more than 7 years imprisonment, but no minimum sentence of less than 7 years is provided) – There is a gap in the legislation – The court cannot fill the gap by saying that these offences should be treated as heinous offences – The legislature should take a call in this matter – However, till the Legislature takes the call, the court in exercise of power u/ Art. 142 of the Constitution directs that from the date the Act came into force, all the 4th category offences shall be treated as ‘serious offence’. Interpretation of Statutes:  Correction of errors in legislation – Held: If the intention of the legislature is clear from the objects and reasons of the statute, the court can correct errors in the legislation and may write down or omit/delete/add words to serve the purpose of legislation – But when intention of legislature is not clear, the Court cannot add or subtract words from the statute.

carry out earth work, drainage behind lining and cement concrete lining – Estimated cost of project was Rs.31 lakhs and contract amount for the work was fixed at Rs.59.86 lakhs – Claimant raised demand for additional payment on the ground that during execution, the scope of work was considerably increased on account of various decisions by department regarding rebuilding of river banks and changes in the strata encountered during excavation due to incorrect geological data observations by department prior to inviting tender – Demand of additional payment led to arbitral dispute – Arbitrator accepted claim and passed award with 18% interest – Award presented before Sub-judge for making ‘rule of court’ – Opposite party filed objection that no reason was indicated for giving the award – Sub-judge accepted the objection to the extent of rejection of Claim no.1 and reduction of interest to 12% p.a. and in other respects the Award was made ‘Rule of Court’ – First appellate court rejected the claim in toto taking note of Clause 39 of the Contract Agreement which provided that the contractor was required to deliver in the office of the Executive Engineer every month during continuance of the work, the return showing details of extra work done with value of such work and if the details are not indicated, it shall be deemed that the contractor has waived all claims not included in such returns and will have no right to enforce any such claim not so included – In that light since the claim was ultimately found as not included in the monthly statement, the First Appellate Court held that the requirement of the conditions of the contract was not adhered to and set aside the Award of the Arbitrator – High Court also took note of Clause 39 of the contract and declined the claim except claim no.1 – In the instant appeal, it was contended by appellant-claimant that Note 6 to the schedule of work which formed a part of the contract provided that extra or other items of work shall be paid at the rate worked out on the basis of relevant Punjab Common Schedule of Rates Basis Plus Sanctioned Premium at the time of tendering – The difference between the estimated cost of Rs.31 lakhs and contract amount of Rs.59.86 lakhs was the sanctioned premium which corresponded to the overall premium of 93.12% on the work for computing the rates of extra items/quantity or work done – Insofar as the remaining claims, 93.12% would become applicable – It was contended that when the contract agreement is explicit insofar as the value and the difference being the sanctioned premium and the percentage being evident at 93.12%, the decision of the Arbitrator not indicating any further reasons in the Award would not be fatal – Opposite party (State of Punjab), referred to Clause 63 of the contract which provides for reference of the disputes to arbitration – The said clause specified the requirement that all Awards shall be in writing and in case of awards amounting to Rs.1 lakh and above, such Award shall state the reason for the amount awarded – Held: The quantum of the contract amount as against the estimated cost by itself could not have formed the basis to conclude the claim as made by the claimant towards sanctioned premium – Claim No.8 related to the work carried out on Daldal land wherein the soil was marshy and extra construction material was required to complete the work – Arbitrator awarded Rs.19.15 lakhs after indicating the amount for the said work on the same basis and deducting the agreed rate – Clause 39, no doubt, prescribes a method by which the claim is to be put forth in the statement every month – The said requirement will have to be construed as being put in the agreement so as to ensure that the additional work has actually been done, the claim is put forth along with details so that baseless claim is not made at a distant point in time when it will not be possible to determine – Though the Clause also indicates that if such claim is not made, it would amount to waiver, in a circumstance where the claim is ultimately put forth in the forum where an adjudication is made and based on the material if the adjudicating authority is satisfied that the actual work had been done and the contractor being entitled to the extra amount spent by him to carry out the work in an appropriate manner, it would not be just and proper to deny such claim only on the ground that it had not been indicated strictly in the manner as provided in the contract specially keeping in view the nature of work undertaken – When the fact remains that the Daldal land was situated in the area, work was carried out and extra material was used, the claim cannot be rejected outright adopting a technical view of the matter – However, the claim for the extra item will have to be calculated with premium at the same rate of 35.02% over and above the agreed rate and not at 93.12% – Regarding Claim No.16, no reason to interfere with the impugned orders – Further with regard to the interest sought under Claim No.18 in the absence of agreement with regard to the rate of interest, the interest as awarded by the Arbitrator was on the higher side and the First Appellate Court was justified in reducing the same to 12% p.a. – Claimant is entitled to the claim for extra items as put forth under Claim Nos. 2, 3, 8 and 12 by working out the difference of cost on the tender premium at 35.02% – On arriving at the quantum of the amount, the same shall be payable with interest at 12% p.a. in the manner as ordered by the First Appellate Court – Claim No.1 ordered by the High Court is sustained.

Zamindari Abolition and Land Reforms Act, 1950 – ss.157-B, 161, 166, 167 – Respondents entered into an exchange with a member of Scheduled Tribe by way of registered exchange deed – Respondents gave 4½ Muthi of land in return for 12 Nali of agricultural land – Assistant Collector held that the exchange violates s.161(1) and the exchange deed being in violation of provisions of the 1950 Act is void – Respondents filed appeal – Dismissed – Revision petition – Dismissed – Writ petition filed by the respondents – Allowed – Held: s.161 pertains to exchange of land, as per which a bhumidhar may exchange land with another bhumidhar or with any Gaon Sabha or local authority, with the prior permission of an Assistant Collector – Insofar as the land belonging to a member of Scheduled Tribe, exchange is not permissible – Under s.157-B, no bhumidhar or asami belonging to a Scheduled Tribe, shall have the right to transfer by way of “sale, gift, mortgage or lease or otherwise any land to a person not belonging to a Scheduled Tribe” – Language used in s.157-B “or otherwise” emphasizes that the land belonging to a Scheduled Tribe cannot be transferred in any manner whatsoever – Further, in the instant case admittedly, even no prior permission was sought from the Assistant Collector – Also, respondents did not explain as to why a member of Scheduled Tribe wanted to exchange his large extent of land i.e.12 Nali (2400 sq. mtrs.) with a much smaller piece of land i.e. 4½ Muthi (56.25 sq. mtrs.) – This raises doubt about the genuineness of exchange deed strengthened by the fact that respondents’ names were mutated in the land exchanged while that of the member of Scheduled Tribe was not – Since the exchange deed violated s.157-B, the transfer is void u/s.166 – No justification to consider respondents’ request on the basis they are running Hotel on the land – No ground for considering questions of equity – When there is a clear statutory provision barring the transfer, it was not open to the High Court to substitute its view in place of that provision – Such interpretation would defeat the benevolent object of the provisions of the 1950 Act and the constitutional scheme providing for social and economic empowerment of the Scheduled Tribes – Judgment of High Court set aside – Appellants at liberty to proceed in accordance with law – Interpretation of Statutes – Equity – Indian Stamp Act – Article 31 of Schedule 1-B. U.P. Zamindari Abolition and Land Reforms Act, 1950 – s.161 – Exchange of land – Requirement of prior permission u/s.161 – Discussed. U.P. Zamindari Abolition and Land Reforms Act, 1950 – ss.3(14), 143, 144 – Respondents entered into a land exchange with a member of Scheduled Tribe and gave 4½ Muthi of land in return for 12 Nali of agricultural land – Exchange deed was held to be void being in violation of provisions of the 1950 Act – Respondents inter alia pleaded that the land in question is not an “agricultural land” and does not fall within the definition of “land” u/s.3(14) thus, provisions of Chapter VIII of the Act are not applicable – Held: For changing the nature of land from “agricultural” to “abadi”, declaration as stipulated in ss.143 & 144 is required – Respondents did not produce any such document which shows that such declaration was made much less registered – In absence thereof, the land is deemed to be an “agricultural land” as per s.3(14) and the provisions of the 1950 Act are applicable to the land in question.
