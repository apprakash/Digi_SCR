Pay scale – Entitlement to – Employees seeking pay scale equivalent to their counterparts in the State of Punjab from 1.1.1986, though revised pay scale was allowed by the Federation w.e.f. 1.1.1994 – High Court holding that employees were entitled to pay scale – Held: Not justified – Principle of equal pay for equal work not applicable to them in as much as Grade I is a higher post having higher duties and responsibilities than Grade II – Milk Procurement Assistants Grade-I is a promotion alavenue for Milk Procurement Assistants Grade-II – Educational qualifications and the responsibilities of the two posts are quite different.",

Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973: s.31(1) – Held: s.31(1) vests complete discretion with the Court to order the sentences for two or more offences at one trial to run concurrently having regard to the nature of offences and the surrounding factors – There cannot be any straitjacket approach in the matter of exercise of such discretion by the Court; but this discretion has to be judiciously exercised with reference to the nature of the offence/s committed and the facts and circumstances of the case – However, if the sentences (other than life imprisonment) are not provided to run concurrently, one would run after the other, in such order as the Court may direct. Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973: s.220 – The ‘single transaction’ principle is essentially referable to s.220 which provides that if more offences than one are committed in one series of acts so connected together as to form the same transaction, then the accused may be charged with and tried at one trial for every such offence – In a given case, after such trial for multiple offences, if the accused is convicted and awarded different punishments, concurrent running thereof may be provided depending on the facts and the relevant surrounding factors.",

XXIII provides that where it is proved to the satisfaction of the Court that a suit has been adjusted wholly or in part by any lawful agreement or compromise, the Court shall order such agreement or compromise to be recorded and pass a decree in accordance therewith – r.3 uses the expression “lawful agreement or compromise” – A conjoint reading of ss.10, 13 and 14 of Indian Contract Act indicates that when consent is obtained by coercion, undue influence, fraud, misrepresentation or mistake, such consent is not free consent and the contract becomes voidable at the option of the party whose consent was caused due to coercion, fraud or misrepresentation – An agreement, which is void or voidable under the Indian Contract Act, shall not be deemed to be lawful as is provided by Explanation to r.3 of Or.XXIII – Contract Act, 1872. Code of Civil Procedure, 1908: Or.XXIII r.3A – In the plaint, plaintiff pleaded that compromise recorded on 06.08.1984 was not lawful compromise having been obtained by fraud and misrepresentation – Plaintiff’s case was that they were represented by D1 that the compromise was entered only to save the family property since the plaintiff has given personal guarantee to the Bank for obtaining loan for business – Pleadings clearly made out the case of the plaintiff that the consent which he gave for compromise by signing the compromise deed was not free consent – The compromise, thus, became voidable at the instance of the plaintiff – Thus, bar under r.3A shall be attracted. Consent decree: Challenge against – A party to a consent decree based on a compromise to challenge the compromise decree on the ground that the decree was not lawful, i.e., it was void or voidable has to approach the same court, which recorded the compromise and a separate suit challenging the consent decree has been held to be not maintainable. Hindu law: Joint Hindu Family – Under Hindu Law, any member of the joint family can separate himself from joint family – The intention of the parties to terminate the status of joint family is a relevant factor to determine the status of Hindu Undivided Family – In the instant case, real intendment of three branches to partition their properties was not that they did not want Hindu Undivided Family to continue rather the said partition was with object to get away from application of Land Ceiling Act, 1961 – Partition Deed dated 07.11.1960 being a registered Partition Deed between three branches, the same cannot be ignored – Properties admittedly were divided in three branches by the said partition – However even after 07.11.1960, the family continued as a Joint Family – There was reunion between three brothers to revert to the status of Joint Hindu Family, which is amply proved from the acts and conducts of the parties subsequent to 07.11.1960 – The purchase of various immovable properties in the names of the three branches clearly indicated the intention that all the three branches were joint and they were purchasing the properties in the name of all the three branches – Plaintiff never admitted the agreement dated 08.03.1981 or alleged partition of 08.03.1981 – It is, thus, clear that parties remained joint and properties standing in the names of three branches remained joint till the consent decree was passed on 06.08.1984 – Thus, in the year 1979 when residential property of Tatabad was obtained in the name of defendant No.1, all three branches were part of the joint Hindu family and the house property purchased in the name of one member of joint Hindu family was for the benefit of all – Both the Courts below although accepted the partition dated 18.03.1981 as pleaded by D-1 but erred in not considering the consequence of such pleading – When partition of all immovable and movable properties is claimed on 08.03.1981, the conclusion is irresistible that the family was joined till then – Thus, the theory set up by D-1 that all the three branches were separate after 07.11.1960 is denied/belied by claim of partition on 08.03.1981.",

Code of Civil Procedure, 1908: Or.XXIII r.3A – In the plaint, plaintiff pleaded that compromise recorded on 06.08.1984 was not lawful compromise having been obtained by fraud and misrepresentation – Plaintiff’s case was that they were represented by D1 that the compromise was entered only to save the family property since the plaintiff has given personal guarantee to the Bank for obtaining loan for business – Pleadings clearly made out the case of the plaintiff that the consent which he gave for compromise by signing the compromise deed was not free consent – The compromise, thus, became voidable at the instance of the plaintiff – Thus, bar under r.3A shall be attracted. Consent decree: Challenge against – A party to a consent decree based on a compromise to challenge the compromise decree on the ground that the decree was not lawful, i.e., it was void or voidable has to approach the same court, which recorded the compromise and a separate suit challenging the consent decree has been held to be not maintainable.

        "content": "Cyber attack: Pegasus suite of spywares – Allegation of cyber attack on citizens of India/infiltration of software into individual device – Petitioners seeking independent investigation into the allegations – Held: Every citizen of India ought to be protected against the violations of privacy – Right to privacy is directly infringed when there is surveillance or spying done on an individual, either by the State or by any external agency – Of course, if done by State, the same must be justified on constitutional grounds – In the instant matter, time was granted to Union of India to place on record facts pertaining to the events highlighted by the petitioners – Despite repeated assurances and opportunities given, the respondent-Union of India placed on record only a “limited affidavit” which did not shed any light on their stand or provide any clarity as to the facts of the matter at hand – Such a course of action taken by the respondent-Union of India especially in proceedings of the present nature which touches upon the fundamental rights of the citizens of the country is not accepted – Complaint of petitioners is about the misuse or likely misuse of spyware in violations of the right to privacy of citizens – Apprehension of the respondent-Union of India is that any inquiry in this behalf should not jeopardize national security and the steps taken by it to protect national security – There is, thus, a broad consensus that unauthorized surveillance/accessing of stored data from the phones and other devices of citizens for reasons other than nation’s security would be illegal, objectionable and a matter of concern – Petitioners had placed certain material that prima facie merit consideration by this Court – There was no specific denial by Union of India of any of the facts averred by the petitioner – Omnibus and vague denial in the “limited affidavit” is not found sufficient – Prima facie case of petitioners accepted to examine the allegations made – A Technical Committee is constituted comprising of three members, including experts in cyber security, digital forensics, networks and hardware whose functioning would be overseen by a retired Judge of Supreme Court – The Committee is requested to prepare a report after thorough inquiry and place it before this court expeditiously – Matter to be listed after eight weeks."

Tech courses – In a writ petition, the High Court allowed institutions to grant of admission to students for B.Tech (Engineering) Degree Course on the basis of the marks obtained in the qualifying examination – High Court while holding that there was an error apparent in the letter issued by AICTE, issued mandamus that the same benefit should be given to students of the Engineering degree stream as was granted to students for PGDM/MBA courses – On appeal, held: Direction by the High Court to the State Government to admit students to the B. Tech Degree Courses on the basis of the marks obtained in the qualifying examination contrary to the terms of s. 3(1) – AICTE clearly indicated that B. Tech courses cannot be placed at par with PGDM/MBA courses and left it to the decision of the State Government – State Government was duty bound to comply with provision s of s.3(1) – Thus, the High Court not justified in issuing mandamus – Order passed by the High Court set aside – However, students granted admission under the direct entry and under the lateral entry to the B.Tech Degree Courses not to be disturbed – Constitution of India – Art. 142.

Presidential assent u/Art. 254(2) – Requirement of – Plea that that the actual repugnancy was not pointed out to the President while obtaining assent and thus, requirements of Art.254(2) unfilled – Held: Letter written by the State Government seeking presidential assent clearly demonstrates the communication was in compliance with the mandate of Art. 254 – Constitution of India – Art. 254.

Enactment of a retrospective validating Act – Legislative competence of the State legislature – Held: When voidness is a result of repugnancy between the State law and law made by the Parliament, the State legislature can revive of such State law by enacting a subsequent amendment substantively changing the basis of the voidness and applying it retrospectively from a prior date.

Retrospective commencement of date of 2019 Act – Effect of – Held: A law is said to be made on the day it obtains Presidential assent u/Art. 111 or u/Art. 254 or of Governor u/Art. 200 – Commencement of law, unlike making of law, is not a part of the legislative process – For checking repugnancy, the relevant point of time would be the date of assent and not date of commencement – It may appear anomalous to operationalise the 2019 Act from 26.09.2013, a day prior to the making of the 2013 Act, but it does not make any impact on the validity thereof or its substance – Date has been chosen by the State legislature only by way of abundant caution and, rightly – It is relevant to overcome the repugnancy corresponding to the commencement of the 2013 Act – Adopting any other interpretation would not only be unwarranted but would also strike at the very purpose of a retrospective reviving and validating enactment – Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013– Constitution of India – Art. 254. Presidential assent u/Art. 254(2) – Requirement of – Plea that that the actual repugnancy was not pointed out to the President while obtaining assent and thus, requirements of Art.254(2) unfilled – Held: Letter written by the State Government seeking presidential assent clearly demonstrates the communication was in compliance with the mandate of Art. 254 – Constitution of India – Art. 254. Retrospective operation: Retrospective operation of a statute – Concept of – Held: Retrospectivity is to cure including validate certain transactions of the past by making a law in the present and not to compete with the laws existing in the past at that point of time. Enactment of a retrospective validating Act – Legislative competence of the State legislature – Held: When voidness is a result of repugnancy between the State law and law made by the Parliament, the State legislature can revive of such State law by enacting a subsequent amendment substantively changing the basis of the voidness and applying it retrospectively from a prior date. Constitution of India:Art. 254 – Concept of repugnancy and its functioning under – Explained.",

Enactment of the 2019 Act by the State legislature – Legislative competence of – State legislature enacted three State land acquisition statutes-the 1978 Act, the 1997 Act and the 2001 Act – Union legislature thereafter enacted the 2013 Act for land acquisition across the country – Repugnancy between the Union and State enactments – In view thereof, Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement (Tamil Nadu Amendment) Act, 2014 was effected to the 2013 Act whereby s. 105-A inserted in the 2013 Act, making the provisions of the 2013 Act inapplicable to acquisition of land under the three State enactments – Thereafter, the 2014 Act, along with the 1997 Act and 2001 Act, challenged before the High Court on the grounds of repugnancy with the 2013 Act and violation of Article 14 – High Court struck down and declared all three State laws to be void for repugnancy and set aside all land acquisitions thereunder post coming into effect of the 2013 Act – To protect the nullified State enactments, the State legislature brought the 2019 Act – 2019 Act was applied retrospectively from 26.09.2013 with the objective to validate all pending acquisitions on and after that date under the State enactments, otherwise quashed by the High Court – State legislature enacting the 2019 Act, if transgressed the limits of its legislative competence having the effect of nullifying/overruling the judgment of the High Court – Held: Legislative intent behind the 2019 Act and more particularly, the assent accorded thereto by the Governor and the President of India for overcoming repugnancy with the Act made by the Parliament, was to revive the operation of the State enactments declared as null and void being unconstitutional and repugnant to the Act made by the Parliament and to amend the same, as well as, validate the actions already taken by the State authorities – Concerned constitutional bodies understood the substance of what is placed before them – Concern is with the substance of the legislature and not its form – 2019 Act is a conscious attempt by the State legislature to bring four material aspects of land acquisition under the three State enactments at par with the 2013 Act-compensation, rehabilitation, resettlement and infrastructure facilities – Effect of the 2019 Act is to change the law retrospectively and not to overrule the judgment of the Court – There is no irreconcilability between the High Court judgment and the 2019 Act – Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013 – Tamil Nadu Acquisition of Land for Harijan Welfare Schemes Act, 1978 – Tamil Nadu Acquisition of Land for Industrial Purposes Act, 1997 – Tamil Nadu Highways Act, 2001 – Constitution of India – Art. 254. Retrospective commencement of date of 2019 Act – Effect of – Held: A law is said to be made on the day it obtains Presidential assent u/Art. 111 or u/Art. 254 or of Governor u/Art. 200 – Commencement of law, unlike making of law, is not a part of the legislative process – For checking repugnancy, the relevant point of time would be the date of assent and not date of commencement – It may appear anomalous to operationalise the 2019 Act from 26.09.2013, a day prior to the making of the 2013 Act, but it does not make any impact on the validity thereof or its substance – Date has been chosen by the State legislature only by way of abundant caution and, rightly – It is relevant to overcome the repugnancy corresponding to the commencement of the 2013 Act – Adopting any other interpretation would not only be unwarranted but would also strike at the very purpose of a retrospective reviving and validating enactment – Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013– Constitution of India – Art. 254. Presidential assent u/Art. 254(2) – Requirement of – Plea that that the actual repugnancy was not pointed out to the President while obtaining assent and thus, requirements of Art.254(2) unfilled – Held: Letter written by the State Government seeking presidential assent clearly demonstrates the communication was in compliance with the mandate of Art. 254 – Constitution of India – Art. 254. Retrospective operation: Retrospective operation of a statute – Concept of – Held: Retrospectivity is to cure including validate certain transactions of the past by making a law in the present and not to compete with the laws existing in the past at that point of time. Enactment of a retrospective validating Act – Legislative competence of the State legislature – Held: When voidness is a result of repugnancy between the State law and law made by the Parliament, the State legislature can revive of such State law by enacting a subsequent amendment substantively changing the basis of the voidness and applying it retrospectively from a prior date.

Enactment of the 2019 Act by the State legislature – Legislative competence of – State legislature enacted three State land acquisition statutes-the 1978 Act, the 1997 Act and the 2001 Act – Union legislature thereafter enacted the 2013 Act for land acquisition across the country – Repugnancy between the Union and State enactments – In view thereof, Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement (Tamil Nadu Amendment) Act, 2014 was effected to the 2013 Act whereby s. 105-A inserted in the 2013 Act, making the provisions of the 2013 Act inapplicable to acquisition of land under the three State enactments – Thereafter, the 2014 Act, along with the 1997 Act and 2001 Act, challenged before the High Court on the grounds of repugnancy with the 2013 Act and violation of Article 14 – High Court struck down and declared all three State laws to be void for repugnancy and set aside all land acquisitions thereunder post coming into effect of the 2013 Act – To protect the nullified State enactments, the State legislature brought the 2019 Act – 2019 Act was applied retrospectively from 26.09.2013 with the objective to validate all pending acquisitions on and after that date under the State enactments, otherwise quashed by the High Court – State legislature enacting the 2019 Act, if transgressed the limits of its legislative competence having the effect of nullifying/overruling the judgment of the High Court – Held: Legislative intent behind the 2019 Act and more particularly, the assent accorded thereto by the Governor and the President of India for overcoming repugnancy with the Act made by the Parliament, was to revive the operation of the State enactments declared as null and void being unconstitutional and repugnant to the Act made by the Parliament and to amend the same, as well as, validate the actions already taken by the State authorities – Concerned constitutional bodies understood the substance of what is placed before them – Concern is with the substance of the legislature and not its form – 2019 Act is a conscious attempt by the State legislature to bring four material aspects of land acquisition under the three State enactments at par with the 2013 Act-compensation, rehabilitation, resettlement and infrastructure facilities – Effect of the 2019 Act is to change the law retrospectively and not to overrule the judgment of the Court – There is no irreconcilability between the High Court judgment and the 2019 Act – Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013 – Tamil Nadu Acquisition of Land for Harijan Welfare Schemes Act, 1978 – Tamil Nadu Acquisition of Land for Industrial Purposes Act, 1997 – Tamil Nadu Highways Act, 2001 – Constitution of India – Art. 254. Retrospective commencement of date of 2019 Act – Effect of – Held: A law is said to be made on the day it obtains Presidential assent u/Art. 111 or u/Art. 254 or of Governor u/Art. 200 – Commencement of law, unlike making of law, is not a part of the legislative process – For checking repugnancy, the relevant point of time would be the date of assent and not date of commencement – It may appear anomalous to operationalise the 2019 Act from 26.09.2013, a day prior to the making of the 2013 Act, but it does not make any impact on the validity thereof or its substance – Date has been chosen by the State legislature only by way of abundant caution and, rightly – It is relevant to overcome the repugnancy corresponding to the commencement of the 2013 Act – Adopting any other interpretation would not only be unwarranted but would also strike at the very purpose of a retrospective reviving and validating enactment – Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013– Constitution of India – Art. 254. Presidential assent u/Art. 254(2) – Requirement of – Plea that that the actual repugnancy was not pointed out to the President while obtaining assent and thus, requirements of Art.254(2) unfilled – Held: Letter written by the State Government seeking presidential assent clearly demonstrates the communication was in compliance with the mandate of Art. 254 – Constitution of India – Art. 254. Retrospective operation: Retrospective operation of a statute – Concept of – Held: Retrospectivity is to cure including validate certain transactions of the past by making a law in the present and not to compete with the laws existing in the past at that point of time. Enactment of a retrospective validating Act – Legislative competence of the State legislature – Held: When voidness is a result of repugnancy between the State law and law made by the Parliament, the State legislature can revive of such State law by enacting a subsequent amendment substantively changing the basis of the voidness and applying it retrospectively from a prior date.

Enactment of the 2019 Act by the State legislature – Legislative competence of – State legislature enacted three State land acquisition statutes-the 1978 Act, the 1997 Act and the 2001 Act – Union legislature thereafter enacted the 2013 Act for land acquisition across the country – Repugnancy between the Union and State enactments – In view thereof, Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement (Tamil Nadu Amendment) Act, 2014 was effected to the 2013 Act whereby s. 105-A inserted in the 2013 Act, making the provisions of the 2013 Act inapplicable to acquisition of land under the three State enactments – Thereafter, the 2014 Act, along with the 1997 Act and 2001 Act, challenged before the High Court on the grounds of repugnancy with the 2013 Act and violation of Article 14 – High Court struck down and declared all three State laws to be void for repugnancy and set aside all land acquisitions thereunder post coming into effect of the 2013 Act – To protect the nullified State enactments, the State legislature brought the 2019 Act – 2019 Act was applied retrospectively from 26.09.2013 with the objective to validate all pending acquisitions on and after that date under the State enactments, otherwise quashed by the High Court – State legislature enacting the 2019 Act, if transgressed the limits of its legislative competence having the effect of nullifying/overruling the judgment of the High Court – Held: Legislative intent behind the 2019 Act and more particularly, the assent accorded thereto by the Governor and the President of India for overcoming repugnancy with the Act made by the Parliament, was to revive the operation of the State enactments declared as null and void being unconstitutional and repugnant to the Act made by the Parliament and to amend the same, as well as, validate the actions already taken by the State authorities – Concerned constitutional bodies understood the substance of what is placed before them – Concern is with the substance of the legislature and not its form – 2019 Act is a conscious attempt by the State legislature to bring four material aspects of land acquisition under the three State enactments at par with the 2013 Act-compensation, rehabilitation, resettlement and infrastructure facilities – Effect of the 2019 Act is to change the law retrospectively and not to overrule the judgment of the Court – There is no irreconcilability between the High Court judgment and the 2019 Act – Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013 – Tamil Nadu Acquisition of Land for Harijan Welfare Schemes Act, 1978 – Tamil Nadu Acquisition of Land for Industrial Purposes Act, 1997 – Tamil Nadu Highways Act, 2001 – Constitution of India – Art. 254. Retrospective commencement of date of 2019 Act – Effect of – Held: A law is said to be made on the day it obtains Presidential assent u/Art. 111 or u/Art. 254 or of Governor u/Art. 200 – Commencement of law, unlike making of law, is not a part of the legislative process – For checking repugnancy, the relevant point of time would be the date of assent and not date of commencement – It may appear anomalous to operationalise the 2019 Act from 26.09.2013, a day prior to the making of the 2013 Act, but it does not make any impact on the validity thereof or its substance – Date has been chosen by the State legislature only by way of abundant caution and, rightly – It is relevant to overcome the repugnancy corresponding to the commencement of the 2013 Act – Adopting any other interpretation would not only be unwarranted but would also strike at the very purpose of a retrospective reviving and validating enactment – Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013– Constitution of India – Art. 254. Presidential assent u/Art. 254(2) – Requirement of – Plea that that the actual repugnancy was not pointed out to the President while obtaining assent and thus, requirements of Art.254(2) unfilled – Held: Letter written by the State Government seeking presidential assent clearly demonstrates the communication was in compliance with the mandate of Art. 254 – Constitution of India – Art. 254. Retrospective operation: Retrospective operation of a statute – Concept of – Held: Retrospectivity is to cure including validate certain transactions of the past by making a law in the present and not to compete with the laws existing in the past at that point of time. Enactment of a retrospective validating Act – Legislative competence of the State legislature – Held: When voidness is a result of repugnancy between the State law and law made by the Parliament, the State legislature can revive of such State law by enacting a subsequent amendment substantively changing the basis of the voidness and applying it retrospectively from a prior date.

Enactment of the 2019 Act by the State legislature – Legislative competence of – State legislature enacted three State land acquisition statutes-the 1978 Act, the 1997 Act and the 2001 Act – Union legislature thereafter enacted the 2013 Act for land acquisition across the country – Repugnancy between the Union and State enactments – In view thereof, Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement (Tamil Nadu Amendment) Act, 2014 was effected to the 2013 Act whereby s. 105-A inserted in the 2013 Act, making the provisions of the 2013 Act inapplicable to acquisition of land under the three State enactments – Thereafter, the 2014 Act, along with the 1997 Act and 2001 Act, challenged before the High Court on the grounds of repugnancy with the 2013 Act and violation of Article 14 – High Court struck down and declared all three State laws to be void for repugnancy and set aside all land acquisitions thereunder post coming into effect of the 2013 Act – To protect the nullified State enactments, the State legislature brought the 2019 Act – 2019 Act was applied retrospectively from 26.09.2013 with the objective to validate all pending acquisitions on and after that date under the State enactments, otherwise quashed by the High Court – State legislature enacting the 2019 Act, if transgressed the limits of its legislative competence having the effect of nullifying/overruling the judgment of the High Court – Held: Legislative intent behind the 2019 Act and more particularly, the assent accorded thereto by the Governor and the President of India for overcoming repugnancy with the Act made by the Parliament, was to revive the operation of the State enactments declared as null and void being unconstitutional and repugnant to the Act made by the Parliament and to amend the same, as well as, validate the actions already taken by the State authorities – Concerned constitutional bodies understood the substance of what is placed before them – Concern is with the substance of the legislature and not its form – 2019 Act is a conscious attempt by the State legislature to bring four material aspects of land acquisition under the three State enactments at par with the 2013 Act-compensation, rehabilitation, resettlement and infrastructure facilities – Effect of the 2019 Act is to change the law retrospectively and not to overrule the judgment of the Court – There is no irreconcilability between the High Court judgment and the 2019 Act – Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013 – Tamil Nadu Acquisition of Land for Harijan Welfare Schemes Act, 1978 – Tamil Nadu Acquisition of Land for Industrial Purposes Act, 1997 – Tamil Nadu Highways Act, 2001 – Constitution of India – Art. 254. Retrospective commencement of date of 2019 Act – Effect of – Held: A law is said to be made on the day it obtains Presidential assent u/Art. 111 or u/Art. 254 or of Governor u/Art. 200 – Commencement of law, unlike making of law, is not a part of the legislative process – For checking repugnancy, the relevant point of time would be the date of assent and not date of commencement – It may appear anomalous to operationalise the 2019 Act from 26.09.2013, a day prior to the making of the 2013 Act, but it does not make any impact on the validity thereof or its substance – Date has been chosen by the State legislature only by way of abundant caution and, rightly – It is relevant to overcome the repugnancy corresponding to the commencement of the 2013 Act – Adopting any other interpretation would not only be unwarranted but would also strike at the very purpose of a retrospective reviving and validating enactment – Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013– Constitution of India – Art. 254. Presidential assent u/Art. 254(2) – Requirement of – Plea that that the actual repugnancy was not pointed out to the President while obtaining assent and thus, requirements of Art.254(2) unfilled – Held: Letter written by the State Government seeking presidential assent clearly demonstrates the communication was in compliance with the mandate of Art. 254 – Constitution of India – Art. 254. Retrospective operation: Retrospective operation of a statute – Concept of – Held: Retrospectivity is to cure including validate certain transactions of the past by making a law in the present and not to compete with the laws existing in the past at that point of time. Enactment of a retrospective validating Act – Legislative competence of the State legislature – Held: When voidness is a result of repugnancy between the State law and law made by the Parliament, the State legislature can revive of such State law by enacting a subsequent amendment substantively changing the basis of the voidness and applying it retrospectively from a prior date. Constitution of India:Art. 254 – Concept of repugnancy and its functioning under – Explained.",

Enactment of the 2019 Act by the State legislature – Legislative competence of – State legislature enacted three State land acquisition statutes-the 1978 Act, the 1997 Act and the 2001 Act – Union legislature thereafter enacted the 2013 Act for land acquisition across the country – Repugnancy between the Union and State enactments – In view thereof, Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement (Tamil Nadu Amendment) Act, 2014 was effected to the 2013 Act whereby s. 105-A inserted in the 2013 Act, making the provisions of the 2013 Act inapplicable to acquisition of land under the three State enactments – Thereafter, the 2014 Act, along with the 1997 Act and 2001 Act, challenged before the High Court on the grounds of repugnancy with the 2013 Act and violation of Article 14 – High Court struck down and declared all three State laws to be void for repugnancy and set aside all land acquisitions thereunder post coming into effect of the 2013 Act – To protect the nullified State enactments, the State legislature brought the 2019 Act – 2019 Act was applied retrospectively from 26.09.2013 with the objective to validate all pending acquisitions on and after that date under the State enactments, otherwise quashed by the High Court – State legislature enacting the 2019 Act, if transgressed the limits of its legislative competence having the effect of nullifying/overruling the judgment of the High Court – Held: Legislative intent behind the 2019 Act and more particularly, the assent accorded thereto by the Governor and the President of India for overcoming repugnancy with the Act made by the Parliament, was to revive the operation of the State enactments declared as null and void being unconstitutional and repugnant to the Act made by the Parliament and to amend the same, as well as, validate the actions already taken by the State authorities – Concerned constitutional bodies understood the substance of what is placed before them – Concern is with the substance of the legislature and not its form – 2019 Act is a conscious attempt by the State legislature to bring four material aspects of land acquisition under the three State enactments at par with the 2013 Act-compensation, rehabilitation, resettlement and infrastructure facilities – Effect of the 2019 Act is to change the law retrospectively and not to overrule the judgment of the Court – There is no irreconcilability between the High Court judgment and the 2019 Act – Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013 – Tamil Nadu Acquisition of Land for Harijan Welfare Schemes Act, 1978 – Tamil Nadu Acquisition of Land for Industrial Purposes Act, 1997 – Tamil Nadu Highways Act, 2001 – Constitution of India – Art. 254. Retrospective commencement of date of 2019 Act – Effect of – Held: A law is said to be made on the day it obtains Presidential assent u/Art. 111 or u/Art. 254 or of Governor u/Art. 200 – Commencement of law, unlike making of law, is not a part of the legislative process – For checking repugnancy, the relevant point of time would be the date of assent and not date of commencement – It may appear anomalous to operationalise the 2019 Act from 26.09.2013, a day prior to the making of the 2013 Act, but it does not make any impact on the validity thereof or its substance – Date has been chosen by the State legislature only by way of abundant caution and, rightly – It is relevant to overcome the repugnancy corresponding to the commencement of the 2013 Act – Adopting any other interpretation would not only be unwarranted but would also strike at the very purpose of a retrospective reviving and validating enactment – Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013– Constitution of India – Art. 254. Presidential assent u/Art. 254(2) – Requirement of – Plea that that the actual repugnancy was not pointed out to the President while obtaining assent and thus, requirements of Art.254(2) unfilled – Held: Letter written by the State Government seeking presidential assent clearly demonstrates the communication was in compliance with the mandate of Art. 254 – Constitution of India – Art. 254. Retrospective operation: Retrospective operation of a statute – Concept of – Held: Retrospectivity is to cure including validate certain transactions of the past by making a law in the present and not to compete with the laws existing in the past at that point of time. Enactment of a retrospective validating Act – Legislative competence of the State legislature – Held: When voidness is a result of repugnancy between the State law and law made by the Parliament, the State legislature can revive of such State law by enacting a subsequent amendment substantively changing the basis of the voidness and applying it retrospectively from a prior date.

Covid-19 Pandemic: Disaster Management Act, 2005 – ss. 12, 2(d), 2(e), 2(i), 2(m), 6, 10, 19, 46 and 48 – Prayer for directions to National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA)/Central Government/State Governments to provide ex gratia monetary compensation to the families of the deceased persons who succumbed to the pandemic of Covid-19 – Whether a writ of mandamus can be issued directing the Central Government/National Authority/State Governments to pay a particular amount by way of ex gratia assistance, more particularly Rs. 4 lacs, as prayed by the petitioners – Whether the Court can/may direct to pay a particular amount by way of ex gratia assistance – Held: The Government should be free to take policy decisions/decide priorities (of course to achieve the ultimate goal of DMA 2005, government should be free to take its own decisions/priorities while providing minimum standards of relief and even towards preparedness, mitigation, prevention and recovery), subject to the availability of the resources/ funds and the amount to be spent towards other reliefs on the aid and advice of the experts and looking to the circumstances from time to time – Therefore, no relief can be granted to direct the National Authority/Central Government/State Governments to pay a particular amount towards ex gratia assistance on account of loss of life to the family members of the persons who have died due to Covid-19 – Some States are paying ex gratia assistance to the family members of the persons who have died due to Covid-19 pandemic – However, the same is paid from the Chief Minister Relief Fund or other relief funds, but not from State Disaster Response Fund (SDRF) – To avoid any heart-burning and discriminatory treatment, it would be appropriate for the National Authority to recommend uniform guidelines while providing for the minimum standards of relief in the form of ex gratia assistance on account of loss of life, as mandated under s.12 of the Act – However, at the same time, it will always be open for the concerned States to provide for ex gratia assistance on account of loss of life and other reliefs from their own relief funds (other than SDRF) as it would be a policy decision by the concerned States and they may provide such other relief/reliefs, looking to the availability of the fund – However, merely because some States might have been paying the ex gratia assistance on account of loss of life to the family members of the persons who have died due to Covid-19 pandemic, no writ of mandamus can be issued directing the Central Government/State Governments to pay a particular sum/amount by way of ex gratia assistance as the utilization of the fund/money by the Central Government would depend upon the priorities fixed by them which includes the money/ fund to be used for prevention, preparedness, mitigation, recovery etc. – Therefore, what amount to be paid by way of ex gratia assistance to the family members of the persons who died due to Covid-19 pandemic should be left to the National Authority/Central Government.

Covid-19 Pandemic: Disaster Management Act, 2005 – ss. 12, 2(d), 2(e), 2(i), 2(m), 6, 10, 19, 46 and 48 – Prayer for directions to National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA)/Central Government/State Governments to provide ex gratia monetary compensation to the families of the deceased persons who succumbed to the pandemic of Covid-19 – Whether a writ of mandamus can be issued directing the Central Government/National Authority/State Governments to pay a particular amount by way of ex gratia assistance, more particularly Rs. 4 lacs, as prayed by the petitioners – Whether the Court can/may direct to pay a particular amount by way of ex gratia assistance – Held: The Government should be free to take policy decisions/decide priorities (of course to achieve the ultimate goal of DMA 2005, government should be free to take its own decisions/priorities while providing minimum standards of relief and even towards preparedness, mitigation, prevention and recovery), subject to the availability of the resources/ funds and the amount to be spent towards other reliefs on the aid and advice of the experts and looking to the circumstances from time to time – Therefore, no relief can be granted to direct the National Authority/Central Government/State Governments to pay a particular amount towards ex gratia assistance on account of loss of life to the family members of the persons who have died due to Covid-19 – Some States are paying ex gratia assistance to the family members of the persons who have died due to Covid-19 pandemic – However, the same is paid from the Chief Minister Relief Fund or other relief funds, but not from State Disaster Response Fund (SDRF) – To avoid any heart-burning and discriminatory treatment, it would be appropriate for the National Authority to recommend uniform guidelines while providing for the minimum standards of relief in the form of ex gratia assistance on account of loss of life, as mandated under s.12 of the Act – However, at the same time, it will always be open for the concerned States to provide for ex gratia assistance on account of loss of life and other reliefs from their own relief funds (other than SDRF) as it would be a policy decision by the concerned States and they may provide such other relief/reliefs, looking to the availability of the fund – However, merely because some States might have been paying the ex gratia assistance on account of loss of life to the family members of the persons who have died due to Covid-19 pandemic, no writ of mandamus can be issued directing the Central Government/State Governments to pay a particular sum/amount by way of ex gratia assistance as the utilization of the fund/money by the Central Government would depend upon the priorities fixed by them which includes the money/ fund to be used for prevention, preparedness, mitigation, recovery etc. – Therefore, what amount to be paid by way of ex gratia assistance to the family members of the persons who died due to Covid-19 pandemic should be left to the National Authority/Central Government.

Judicial Review: Scope of – Writ of Mandamus – When can be issued – Held: If the statutory authority/authority fails to perform its statutory duty cast under the statute or constitutional duty, a mandamus can be issued directing the authority to perform its duty cast under the statute – In such a situation, the Court would be absolutely justified in issuing a writ of mandamus directing the authority to perform its statutory duty/constitutional duty.

Covid-19 Pandemic: Disaster Management Act, 2005 – ss. 12, 2(d), 2(e), 2(i), 2(m), 6, 10, 19, 46 and 48 – Prayer for directions to National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA)/Central Government/State Governments to provide ex gratia monetary compensation to the families of the deceased persons who succumbed to the pandemic of Covid-19 – Whether a writ of mandamus can be issued directing the Central Government/National Authority/State Governments to pay a particular amount by way of ex gratia assistance, more particularly Rs. 4 lacs, as prayed by the petitioners – Whether the Court can/may direct to pay a particular amount by way of ex gratia assistance – Held: The Government should be free to take policy decisions/decide priorities (of course to achieve the ultimate goal of DMA 2005, government should be free to take its own decisions/priorities while providing minimum standards of relief and even towards preparedness, mitigation, prevention and recovery), subject to the availability of the resources/ funds and the amount to be spent towards other reliefs on the aid and advice of the experts and looking to the circumstances from time to time – Therefore, no relief can be granted to direct the National Authority/Central Government/State Governments to pay a particular amount towards ex gratia assistance on account of loss of life to the family members of the persons who have died due to Covid-19 – Some States are paying ex gratia assistance to the family members of the persons who have died due to Covid-19 pandemic – However, the same is paid from the Chief Minister Relief Fund or other relief funds, but not from State Disaster Response Fund (SDRF) – To avoid any heart-burning and discriminatory treatment, it would be appropriate for the National Authority to recommend uniform guidelines while providing for the minimum standards of relief in the form of ex gratia assistance on account of loss of life, as mandated under s.12 of the Act – However, at the same time, it will always be open for the concerned States to provide for ex gratia assistance on account of loss of life and other reliefs from their own relief funds (other than SDRF) as it would be a policy decision by the concerned States and they may provide such other relief/reliefs, looking to the availability of the fund – However, merely because some States might have been paying the ex gratia assistance on account of loss of life to the family members of the persons who have died due to Covid-19 pandemic, no writ of mandamus can be issued directing the Central Government/State Governments to pay a particular sum/amount by way of ex gratia assistance as the utilization of the fund/money by the Central Government would depend upon the priorities fixed by them which includes the money/ fund to be used for prevention, preparedness, mitigation, recovery etc. – Therefore, what amount to be paid by way of ex gratia assistance to the family members of the persons who died due to Covid-19 pandemic should be left to the National Authority/Central Government.

Covid-19 Pandemic: Disaster Management Act, 2005 – ss. 2(d), 2(e), 2(i), 2(m), 6, 10, 12, 19, 46 and 48 – Prayer for directions to respondents-State Governments to issue any official document stating cause of death, to the family members of the deceased who died due to Covid-19 – Held: It is the duty of the every authority to issue accurate/correct death certificates stating the correct and accurate cause of death, so that the family members of the deceased who died due to Covid-19 may not face any difficulty in getting the benefits of the schemes that may be declared by the Government for the death of the deceased, who died due to Covid- 19 – In the death certificate also, if a person has died due to Covid- 19 and/or any other complications/disease due to Covid-19, it should be specifically mentioned in the death certificate – The procedure should be as simplified as it can be – Appropriate Authority directed to issue simplified guidelines for issuance of Death Certificates/ official document stating the exact cause of death, i.e., “Death due to Covid-19”, to the family members of the deceased who died due to Covid-19 – Such guidelines may also provide the remedy to the family members of the deceased who died due to Covid-19 for correction of the death certificate/official document issued by the appropriate authority, if they are not satisfied with the cause of death mentioned in the death certificate/official document issued by the appropriate authority. Covid-19 Pandemic: Disaster Management Act, 2005 – ss. 2(d), 2(e), 2(i), 2(m), 6, 10, 12, 19, 46 and 48 – Prayer for directions to the respondents-Union of India and others to provide social security and rehabilitation to the victims of Covid-19 – Held: From the XVth Finance Commission Report, it appears that the Finance Commission in its report has already made recommendations of the same and from the counter affidavit it appears that the Union Government has been actively considering the same in consultation with other stakeholders – Even otherwise, from the counter affidavit filed on behalf of the Union of India, it appears that the Central Government has already launched the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Package under which a comprehensive personal accident cover of Rs. 50 lakhs have been provided to 22.12 lakh health care providers throughout the country, including community health workers and private health workers who may have been in direct contact and care of Covid-19 patients and may be at risk of being impacted/infected by this – It is further reported that on account of unprecedented situation, private hospital staff/retired/volunteer/local urban bodies/contract/daily wage/ad-hoc/outsourced staff requisitioned by States/Central Hospitals/ autonomous hospitals of Central /States/Union Territories, AIIMS & Institute of National Importance (INI)/hospitals of Central Ministries specifically drafted for care of Covid-19 patients are also covered under the scheme – The benefits under the said scheme have been extended for a further period of 180 days with effect from 24.04.2021 – Therefore, it appears that sufficient care has been taken – However, some class might have been left out, like those persons working at pre-mortem – Thus, the Union Government may look into the same and cover them also who might have been left out and who can be said to be in direct contact of dead bodies of Covid-19 patients – The Union of India to take appropriate steps on the recommendations made by the Finance Commission in its XVth Finance Commission Report bearing in mind paragraph 8.131 in consultation with other stakeholders and experts. Disaster Management Act, 2005: Enactment of – Object and purpose – Discussed. Administrative Law: Policy decision – Interference with – Scope – Held: When the Government forms its policy, it is based on a number of circumstances, on facts, law including constraint based governmental resources – The Government is entitled to make pragmatic adjustments which may be called for by particular circumstances – The function of the Court is to see that lawful authority is not abused but not to appropriate to itself the task entrusted to that authority – Therefore, the Courts would be very slow to interfere with priorities fixed by the government in providing reliefs, unless it is patently arbitrary and/or not in the larger public interest at all – Judicial Review. Judicial Review: Scope of – Writ of Mandamus – When can be issued – Held: If the statutory authority/authority fails to perform its statutory duty cast under the statute or constitutional duty, a mandamus can be issued directing the authority to perform its duty cast under the statute – In such a situation, the Court would be absolutely justified in issuing a writ of mandamus directing the authority to perform its statutory duty/constitutional duty.
