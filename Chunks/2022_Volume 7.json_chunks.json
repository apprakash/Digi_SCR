Principles/Doctrines – Doctrine of Eclipse, conflict and repugnancy – The moment the Parliament stepped in to codify the law relating to registration and regulation of NBFCs, by inserting certain provisions in Chapter III-B of the RBI Act, the same would cast a shadow on the applicability of the provisions of the Kerala Act to NBFCs registered under the RBI Act and regulated by RBI – In case of Gujarat, State of Gujarat contended that the Gujarat Act exempts NBFCs registered under the RBI Act from seeking registration under the Gujarat Act – However, u/s. 5(2) of the Gujarat Act, NBFCs registered under the RBI Act are deemed to have been registered under the Gujarat Act – Gujarat Act, 2011 tacitly recognizes the regulation of NBFCs under the RBI Act – Yet the State got the assent of only the Governor – Therefore, Kerala Act and the Gujarat Act will have no application to NBFCs registered under the RBI Act and regulated by RBI – Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934 (RBI Act) – Kerala Money Lenders Act,1958 (Kerala Act) – Gujarat Money Lenders Act, 2011 (Gujarat Act).",

Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973: Stage of charge framing – Approach of Court – Court has to form a presumptive opinion as to the existence of the factual ingredients constituting the offence alleged – Court is not required to go deep into the probative value of the materials on record. Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973: s.239 – Prima facie case u/s.239 – If the Magistrate considers the charge against the accused to be groundless, he shall discharge the accused – The word ‘groundless’ means that there must be no ground for presuming that the accused has committed the offence and that the materials placed before the Court do not make out or are not sufficient to make out a prima facie case against the accused – If no prima facie case regarding the commission of any offence is made out, it would amount to a charge being groundless. Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973: Revisional powers of High Court – Ambit and scope of – Held: Revisional power can only be exercised to correct manifest error of law or procedure which would occasion injustice, if it is not corrected – The revisional power cannot be exercised in a casual or mechanical manner – Revisional power cannot be equated with appellate power – A revisional court cannot undertake meticulous examination of the material on record as it is undertaken by the trial court or the appellate court – This power can only be exercised if there is any legal bar to the continuance of the proceedings or if the facts as stated in the charge sheet are taken to be true on their face value and accepted in their entirety do not constitute the offence for which the accused has been charged – It is conferred to check grave error of law or procedure.",
