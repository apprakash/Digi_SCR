        "HeadNote": "Penal Code, 1860: s.302 – Prosecution case was that onfateful day, appellant-accused murdered his wife and four childrenwith a sharp cutting weapon while they were sleeping – Motivebehind the murder was attributed to extra marital affair of appellantwith one married lady which was highly opposed by the deceased-wife – Discovery statement made by appellant and consequentlyrecovery made – Appellant said to have made extra judicialconfession to prosecution witness – Trial court convicted theappellant and passed death sentence – High Court confirmed thedeath sentence – Hence instant appeal – Held: Present case is basedon circumstantial evidence – Mere discovery is insufficient to inferthe authorship of concealment by the person who discovered theweapon – The exact words of the accused person while makingdiscovery statement was not deposed by prosecution witness –Further, the contents of panchnama were not proved – Credibilityof police witness (PW-6 and PW-7) was doubtful and evidence ofdiscovery was held to be unreliable – Credibility of extra judicialconfession was also doubted in view of oral evidence of prosecutionwitness – As circumstance relating to extra judicial confession anddiscovery of weapon of offence were not established, the chain ofcircumstantial evidence was not established fully and thus othercircumstance such as motive or the evidence of false explanationoffered by the appellant as an additional link in chain of evidencewere not considered – Further, the explanation offered by theaccused for injuries on his body could be said to be compatiblewith the defense story – Prosecution failed to establish the casebeyond reasonable doubt and therefore the conviction is set aside.Evidence Act, 1872: s.8 – Relevance of Motive – CircumstantialEvidence – There cannot be straight jacket formula for appreciationof circumstantial evidence – Circumstances suggesting guilt mustbe cogently and firmly established – The same must be of definitetendency and conclusive in nature – The circumstances should formthe chain which conclusively points towards the guilt of accused inall human probability – Circumstantial evidence must be completeand should be devoid of any hypothesis giving room for accused’sinnocence but must support only one hypothesis i.e. his guilt – Motive,though not as such an element of crime, but it assumes greaterimportance in cases resting on circumstantial evidence – Absenceof motive could be a missing link of incriminating circumstances,but once the prosecution has established the other incriminatingcircumstances to its entirety, absence of motive will not give anybenefit to the accused – Motive could be an important circumstancebut it per se does not take place as conclusive proof that the personconcerned was the author of the crime.Evidence Act, 1872: s.27 – Discovery Statement – Informationreceived from the accused must result into discovery of fact for s.27 to apply – While making such deposition, the accused must be inpolice custody – Only so much of information as relates distinctlyto the fact thereby discovered is admissible – Further mere discoverycannot be interpreted as sufficient to infer authorship of concealmentby the person who discovered the weapon – There might be thepossibility that the person may have seen somebody concealing theweapon, therefore it cannot be presumed or inferred that because aperson discovered weapon, he was the person who concealed it,least it can be presumed that he used it.Evidence Act, 1872: Confession – Classification and Scope– Confession can be classified as Judicial and extra-judicial –Former relates to those which are made before the Magistrate orCourt – Extra Judicial are made before a private individual andwhich may include judicial officer in private capacity andMagistrate not especially empowered u/s 164 CrPC or the one soempowered but receiving confession at stage where s.164 does notapply.Evidence Act, 1872: Extra Judicial Confession – Weightage– It is a weak type of evidence since it can be easily procuredwhenever direct evidence is not available – It is not open to theCourt to start with a presumption that extra-judicial confession isA weak type of evidence – It can be accepted and can be the basis ofa conviction if it passes the test of credibility – Credibility can betested by keeping in mind that it comes from an unbiased witnesswho is not inimical to accused and who do not have motive forattributing an untruthful statement to the accused etc.B Evidence Act, 1872: Confession – Basis of Conviction –Explained – It is well settled that conviction can be based on avoluntarily confession but the rule of prudence requires thatwherever possible it should be corroborated by the independentevidence – Further Extra-Judicial confession of accused need notin all cases be corroborated – Also the confession procured underpromise or threat or harassment is involuntary in nature and cannotbe use in evidence – Involuntary confession is not which is not theresult of free will of the maker.Evidence Act, 1872: Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 –s.313 – False Explanation tendered by the accused – Whether formsadditional link in circumstantial evidence – Explained – Theprosecution must stand or fall on its own legs and it cannot deriveany strength from the weakness of the defence – It is not the lawwhere there is any infirmity or lacunae in the prosecution case, thesame could be cured or supplied by a false defence or a false pleawhich is not accepted by a Court – Only when all the circumstantialevidence are well established which points towards the guilt thenonly false explanation or false defence tendered by accused can beused as additional link and not otherwise.Evidence Act, 1872: Burden of Proof – Extent and Meaning– In criminal trial the burden on the accused is to show the“preponderance of probabilty” – The accused is not under burdento prove his case beyond reasonable doubt unlike prosecution –The meaning which the term “preponderance of probabilty” carriesis something which connotes to “more probable and rational viewof the case”, not necessarily as certain as the pleading should be –The high standard of proof as required for prosecution is only toavoid wrongful conviction as the wrongful conviction leads togreater injustice than wrongful acquittal.Constitution of India: Art.39A – Code of Criminal Procedure,1973 – s.304 – Legal Services Authorities Act, 1987 – s.9 – Legalaid to accused – Duty of State – Explained – What is meant by theduty of the State to ensure a fair defence to an accused is not theemployment of a defence counsel for namesake – It has to be theprovision of a counsel who defends the accused diligently to thebest of his abilities – The presence of counsel on record meanseffective, genuine and faithful presence and not a mere farcical,sham or a virtual presence that is illusory, if not fraudulent –Indigence should never be a ground for denying fair trial or equaljustice therefore, particular attention should be paid to appointcompetent advocates, equal to handling the complex cases, notpatronising gestures to raw entrants to the Bar",

Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016: s. 5 (8) – FinancialDebt – When an amount could be termed as such – The policy oflaw under IBC requires “Disbursement” leading to a debt alongwith interest – Interest, as such, is not a necessary requirement of s.5(8), but the fact of disbursement from the creditor to the debtor isa necessity for looking a debt as financial debt, as contemplated bythe said section – Such Disbursement has to be understood in termsof money which has been paid by the creditor and debtor.Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016: ss 5(8), 3(33) –Words ‘Transaction’ and ‘Disbursed’ – Distinguished – The word“transaction” includes transfer of assets, funds or goods andservices from or to the corporate debtors – But imposing such ameaning of the word “Transaction” as inclusive in the word“Disbursed” will lead to unnecessary straining of the provision –Interpretation of the term Disbursed, as occurring u/s.5(8), shouldmean the payment of money, which flows to the debtor.Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016: ss 3(6), 5(8) – Words‘Claim’ and ‘Debt’ – Claim, as defined u/s.3(6), may or may not befixed, disputed or undisputed, secured or unsecured but it bears anindispensable element of “right to payment” – Claim cannot existsindependent of the element of “right to payment” – The source ofsuch “right to payment” can be either under a judgment or underany other circumstance – When claim is accompanied by liability itgives rise to debt – Debt, as defined under the Code includesfinancial as well as operational debt and the same appears to beintertwined with the definition of “claim” – Debt denotes a liabilityor obligation which relates to a claim.Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016: s.5(8)(d) – IndianAccounting Standards – rr.61 to 67 – Financial Lease – Financiallease as such is not defined under IBC – s.5(8)(d) refers lease asinclusive of Financial lease as given under Indian AccountingStandards – r.62 declares that a lease is classified as a financiallease if it transfers, substantially, all the risks and rewards incidentalto ownership of an underlying asset – As per r.63, what matters fora lease to be financial lease is its substance and not the form – Inthe instant case, the rights are transferred in favour of the alloteesonly by way of a sub-lease, and therefore there is no transfer ofownership of the underlying asset (plot) by the end of the leaseterms – Further the criteria u/r.63 that the lease will be a financiallease even if the title is not transferred provided the lease term isfor the major part of economic life – In the instant case the “principleof economic life of underlying asset” is inapposite as here theunderlying asset is land and the economic life of the land is notlimited as the land does not depreciate with the passage of time – Inthe instant case, there is no substantial transfer of risks and rewardsincidental to ownership since the appellant (lessor) has reservedthe right of cancellation of lease in larger public interest andtherefore such appellant is not a financial lessor u/s.5(8)(d) of IBC.Lessee and sub-lease – Rights and Limitations – Lessee canassign his rights as a lessee which amounts to assignment of hisrights and, therefore, can create a sub-lease – But the creation ofsuch sub-lease has limitation and it must conform to the terms ofcontract between the lessor and lessee.Lessee and his right to Mortgage – Extent and Limitation – lease may enable the lessee to mortgaged the leased property – Butin cases where the mortgage by the lessee can be only with theprior permission of lessor, his rights are not absolute and isconditional upon the approval or denial by the lessor of thepermission to make such mortgage.Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016: s.5(8)(f) –Interpretation – “Financial Debt includes any amount raised underany other transaction, including any forward sale or purchaseagreement, having the commercial effect of a borrowing” – Scopeof – The phrase has a relevance as the same is residuary in nature– For this phrase to apply so as to enable a person for being termedas Financial Creditor, there has to be a raising of funds in atransaction which has a commercial effect – The first and foremostrule for making such phrase to apply there has to be “raising offunds” – The raising of funds can be by issuing bonds, notes,debentures or loan stock etc – In the instant case, the raising offunds was done by the lessee from the allottees and not by theappellants and hence the appellant is not entitled to the applicationof the said residuary provision and therefore he cannot avail thebenefit of being called a “Financial Creditor”",

O. does not run contrary to any ofthe provisions of the Act and the rules framed there under – Theexecutive was well within its jurisdiction to ensure that the studentscome in the uniform prescribed by the College DevelopmentCommittee – The object of the G.O. was to ensure that there isparity amongst the students in terms of uniform – the purpose wasonly to promote uniformity and encourage a secular environmentin the schools, which is in tune with the right guaranteed underArt.14 – Art.25(2)(a) gives primacy to laws made by competentlegislature for regulation of secular aspects and Art.25(2)(b) givesprimacy to “social welfare” and “reform’’ – If a particular practice/belief/part of any religion is in existence and is found to be subjectedto either “social welfare” and “reform”, such right will have togive way to “social welfare” and “reform” – The religious beliefcannot be carried to a secular school maintained out of State funds– It is open to the students to carry their faith in a school whichpermits them to wear Hijab or any other mark – The right underArt.19(1)(a) as a right of expression to dress as per one’s own will,however, is also subject to reasonable restrictions under sub-clause(2) of Art.19 – None of the fundamental rights is absolute, curtailmentof the right is permissible by following due procedure which canwithstand the test of reasonableness – Students have no right to bein the school in violation of the mandate of the uniform prescribedunder the Statute and the Rules – If students choose not to attendclasses due to the uniform that has been prescribed, it is a voluntaryact of such students and cannot be said to be in violation of Art.29by the State – G.O. cannot be said to be against the ethic ofsecularism or to the objective of the Karnataka Education Act, 1983– Per Sudhanshu Dhulia, J. (Dissenting): The question of ERP was notat all relevant in the determination of the dispute before the Court –Instead of straightaway taking the ERP route, the High Court couldhave first examined whether the restriction imposed by the schoolor the G.O on wearing a Hijab, were valid restrictions or whetherthese restrictions are hit by the Doctrine of Proportionality – Theentire exercise done by the High Court, in evaluating the rights ofthe petitioners only on the touchstone of ERP, was incorrect – If thebelief is sincere, and it harms no one else, there can be no justifiablereasons for banning Hijab in a classroom – Asking a pre universityschoolgirl to take off her Hijab at her school gate, is an invasion onher privacy and dignity – G.O. and the restrictions on the wearingof hijab, goes against our constitutional value of fraternity andhuman dignity – Under our Constitutional scheme, wearing a Hijabshould be simply a matter of choice – It may or may not be a matterof ERP, but it still is, a matter of conscience, belief, and expression– Asking the girls to take off their Hijab before entering the schoolgates is clearly violative of Arts.19(1)(a), 21 and 25(1) of theConstitution – There shall be no restriction on the wearing of Hijabanywhere in schools and colleges in Karnataka – Held: In view ofthe divergent views expressed by the Bench, the matter to be placedbefore the Chief Justice of India for constitution of an appropriateBench – Karnataka Education Act, 1983 – ss.133, 145 – KarnatakaEducational Institutions (Classification, Regulation and Prescriptionof Curricula etc.) Rules, 1995 – rr.11, 16.",

O. does not run contrary to any ofthe provisions of the Act and the rules framed there under – Theexecutive was well within its jurisdiction to ensure that the studentscome in the uniform prescribed by the College DevelopmentCommittee – The object of the G.O. was to ensure that there isparity amongst the students in terms of uniform – the purpose wasonly to promote uniformity and encourage a secular environmentin the schools, which is in tune with the right guaranteed underArt.14 – Art.25(2)(a) gives primacy to laws made by competentlegislature for regulation of secular aspects and Art.25(2)(b) givesprimacy to “social welfare” and “reform’’ – If a particular practice/belief/part of any religion is in existence and is found to be subjectedto either “social welfare” and “reform”, such right will have togive way to “social welfare” and “reform” – The religious beliefcannot be carried to a secular school maintained out of State funds– It is open to the students to carry their faith in a school whichpermits them to wear Hijab or any other mark – The right underArt.19(1)(a) as a right of expression to dress as per one’s own will,however, is also subject to reasonable restrictions under sub-clause(2) of Art.19 – None of the fundamental rights is absolute, curtailmentof the right is permissible by following due procedure which canwithstand the test of reasonableness – Students have no right to bein the school in violation of the mandate of the uniform prescribedunder the Statute and the Rules – If students choose not to attendclasses due to the uniform that has been prescribed, it is a voluntaryact of such students and cannot be said to be in violation of Art.29by the State – G.O. cannot be said to be against the ethic ofsecularism or to the objective of the Karnataka Education Act, 1983– Per Sudhanshu Dhulia, J. (Dissenting): The question of ERP was notat all relevant in the determination of the dispute before the Court –Instead of straightaway taking the ERP route, the High Court couldhave first examined whether the restriction imposed by the schoolor the G.O on wearing a Hijab, were valid restrictions or whetherthese restrictions are hit by the Doctrine of Proportionality – Theentire exercise done by the High Court, in evaluating the rights ofthe petitioners only on the touchstone of ERP, was incorrect – If thebelief is sincere, and it harms no one else, there can be no justifiablereasons for banning Hijab in a classroom – Asking a pre universityschoolgirl to take off her Hijab at her school gate, is an invasion onher privacy and dignity – G.O. and the restrictions on the wearingof hijab, goes against our constitutional value of fraternity andhuman dignity – Under our Constitutional scheme, wearing a Hijabshould be simply a matter of choice – It may or may not be a matterof ERP, but it still is, a matter of conscience, belief, and expression– Asking the girls to take off their Hijab before entering the schoolgates is clearly violative of Arts.19(1)(a), 21 and 25(1) of theConstitution – There shall be no restriction on the wearing of Hijabanywhere in schools and colleges in Karnataka – Held: In view ofthe divergent views expressed by the Bench, the matter to be placedbefore the Chief Justice of India for constitution of an appropriateBench – Karnataka Education Act, 1983 – ss.133, 145 – KarnatakaEducational Institutions (Classification, Regulation and Prescriptionof Curricula etc.) Rules, 1995 – rr.11, 16.",

O. does not run contrary to any ofthe provisions of the Act and the rules framed there under – Theexecutive was well within its jurisdiction to ensure that the studentscome in the uniform prescribed by the College DevelopmentCommittee – The object of the G.O. was to ensure that there isparity amongst the students in terms of uniform – the purpose wasonly to promote uniformity and encourage a secular environmentin the schools, which is in tune with the right guaranteed underArt.14 – Art.25(2)(a) gives primacy to laws made by competentlegislature for regulation of secular aspects and Art.25(2)(b) givesprimacy to “social welfare” and “reform’’ – If a particular practice/belief/part of any religion is in existence and is found to be subjectedto either “social welfare” and “reform”, such right will have togive way to “social welfare” and “reform” – The religious beliefcannot be carried to a secular school maintained out of State funds– It is open to the students to carry their faith in a school whichpermits them to wear Hijab or any other mark – The right underArt.19(1)(a) as a right of expression to dress as per one’s own will,however, is also subject to reasonable restrictions under sub-clause(2) of Art.19 – None of the fundamental rights is absolute, curtailmentof the right is permissible by following due procedure which canwithstand the test of reasonableness – Students have no right to bein the school in violation of the mandate of the uniform prescribedunder the Statute and the Rules – If students choose not to attendclasses due to the uniform that has been prescribed, it is a voluntaryact of such students and cannot be said to be in violation of Art.29by the State – G.O. cannot be said to be against the ethic ofsecularism or to the objective of the Karnataka Education Act, 1983– Per Sudhanshu Dhulia, J. (Dissenting): The question of ERP was notat all relevant in the determination of the dispute before the Court –Instead of straightaway taking the ERP route, the High Court couldhave first examined whether the restriction imposed by the schoolor the G.O on wearing a Hijab, were valid restrictions or whetherthese restrictions are hit by the Doctrine of Proportionality – Theentire exercise done by the High Court, in evaluating the rights ofthe petitioners only on the touchstone of ERP, was incorrect – If thebelief is sincere, and it harms no one else, there can be no justifiablereasons for banning Hijab in a classroom – Asking a pre universityschoolgirl to take off her Hijab at her school gate, is an invasion onher privacy and dignity – G.O. and the restrictions on the wearingof hijab, goes against our constitutional value of fraternity andhuman dignity – Under our Constitutional scheme, wearing a Hijabshould be simply a matter of choice – It may or may not be a matterof ERP, but it still is, a matter of conscience, belief, and expression– Asking the girls to take off their Hijab before entering the schoolgates is clearly violative of Arts.19(1)(a), 21 and 25(1) of theConstitution – There shall be no restriction on the wearing of Hijabanywhere in schools and colleges in Karnataka – Held: In view ofthe divergent views expressed by the Bench, the matter to be placedbefore the Chief Justice of India for constitution of an appropriateBench – Karnataka Education Act, 1983 – ss.133, 145 – KarnatakaEducational Institutions (Classification, Regulation and Prescriptionof Curricula etc.) Rules, 1995 – rr.11, 16.",

“primary evidence”of the complainant is unavailable owing to his death or any otherreason – Proof of demand and acceptance of illegal gratificationby a public servant as a fact in issue by the prosecution is a sinequa non in order to establish the guilt of the accused public servantu/ss.7 and 13 (1)(d) (i) and (ii) of the Act – Prosecution has to firstprove the demand of illegal gratification and the subsequentacceptance as a matter of fact and the same can be proved bydirect evidence – The proof of demand and acceptance of illegalgratification can also be proved by

remuneration – The expression used therein is “shall presume”which is legal or compulsory presumption – The said provision dealswith a legal presumption which is in the nature of a command that ithas to be presumed that the accused accepted the gratification as amotive or reward for doing or forbearing to do any official act etc.,if the condition envisaged in the former part of the Section is satisfied– It does not say that the said condition should be satisfied throughdirect evidence but the only requirement is that it must be provedthat the accused has accepted or agreed to accept gratification.Evidence Act, 1872: s.3 – Word “Fact” – “Factum Probandum& Factum Probans” – Classification and Connection – Fact consistsof state of things, events or mental state – The principal fact (fact-in-issue) constitutes Factum Probandum whereas the evidentiary fact(relevant fact) constitute Factum Probans – Facts relevant to theissue are evidentiary fact which render probable the existence

evidence is not restricted to only oral and documentaryevidence but also to other things like material objects, the demeanourof the witnesses, facts of which judicial notice could be taken,admissions of parties, local inspection made and answers given bythe accused to questions put forth by the Magistrate or Judge u/s.313 of the Criminal Procedure Code.Evidence Act, 1872 – ss. 3, 59, 60, 61 – Classification ofEvidence – Evidence may be classified as direct evidence (originalevidence) and indirect evidence (substantial evidence) – DirectEvidence establishes the existence of a thing or fact either by actualproduction or by testimony or demonstrable declaration of someonewho has himself perceived it and the same is devoid of any roomfor inference or presumption – Indirect Evidence gives rise to thelogical inference that a fact-in-issue exists, either conclusively orpresumptively – Direct Evidence may constitute either oral ordocumentary evidence – Indirect evidence may constitute evidencewhich is circumstantial in nature.Evidence Act, 1872: s.60 – Oral Evidence – Classificationand Scope – Oral Evidence can be either original or hearsay innature – It is original if it is given by the person who himself haveseen or heard something through his own senses – Hearsay Evidencecould be called as derivative, transmitted or second-hand evidencein which a witness is merely reporting what he had not himself seenor heard but have learnt from some third person – Oral Evidence isalso sub-categorized as Primary and Secondary evidence – Formeris an oral account of the original evidence while latter is a reportor an oral account of the original evidence or a copy of a documentor a model of the original thing – As per the mandate of s.60, theoral evidence must be direct or positive.Evidence Act, 1872: Word “Hearsay evidence” – Scope –The expression “hearsay evidence” is not defined under the EvidenceAct – Hearsay evidence is inadmissible to prove a fact which isdeposed to on hearsay, but it does not necessarily preclude evidenceas to a statement having been made upon which certain action wastaken or certain results followed such as evidence of an informantof the

Documentary evidences are to be proved by productionof documents themselves or, in their absence, by secondary evidenceu/s.65 of the Act – s.61 permits proof of contents of document byprimary or by secondary evidence – As per s.62, primary evidencemean when the document itself is produced for inspection of thecourt – For an evidence to be a secondary evidence for proving thecontents of the document, it must be of the kind as specified u/s.63– As per the mandate of s.64 document must be proved by adducingprimary evidence, except in the cases mentioned u/s.65 – The policyof law is that primary evidence is the best evidence and it affordsthe greatest certainty of the fact in question and it is only when theabsence of the primary source has been satisfactorily explainedthat secondary evidence is permissible to prove the contents ofdocuments.Evidence Act, 1872: ss. 4, 114 – Law regarding presumptions– Word “May Presume, Shall Presume, Conclusive Proof” – FactualPresumption or discretionary presumption come under “MayPresume” and in this case facts may be proved either by adducingevidence or the court may presume the existence of a fact – LegalPresumption or Compulsory Presumption come under “shallpresume” and once it is declared by the law that the court shallpresume the existence of a fact, then the court is under obligationto presume such fact unless such presumption is displaced byadducing evidence contrary to such presumption – Conclusive proofis a strict declaration of law and once a fact is declared to be aconclusive proof of the other, then the court shall not allow theevidence to be adduced to misplace such presumption – Thepresumption as contemplated by s.114 is a discretionary presumption.Evidence Act, 1872: Chapter 7 – Burden of Proof - The phrase“burden of proof” has two meanings one, the burden of proof as amatter of law and pleading and the other, the burden of establishinga case; the former is fixed as a question of law on the basis of thepleadings and is unchanged during the entire trial, whereas thelatter is not constant but shifts as soon as a party adduces sufficientevidence to raise a presumption in his favour.Evidence Act, 1872: Hostile Witness – Admissibility ofEvidence – Settled Legal Position – Even if a witness is treated as“hostile” and is cross-examined, his evidence cannot be written offaltogether but must be considered with due care and circumspectionand that part of the testimony which is creditworthy must beconsidered and acted upon.",

Presumption come under “shallpresume” and once it is declared by the law that the court shallpresume the existence of a fact, then the court is under obligationto presume such fact unless such presumption is displaced byadducing evidence contrary to such presumption – Conclusive proofis a strict declaration of law and once a fact is declared to be aconclusive proof of the other, then the court shall not allow theevidence to be adduced to misplace such presumption – Thepresumption as contemplated by s.114 is a discretionary presumption.Evidence Act, 1872: Chapter 7 – Burden of Proof - The phrase“burden of proof” has two meanings one, the burden of proof as amatter of law and pleading and the other, the burden of establishinga case; the former is fixed as a question of law on the basis of thepleadings and is unchanged during the entire trial, whereas thelatter is not constant but shifts as soon as a party adduces sufficientevidence to raise a presumption in his favour.Evidence Act, 1872: Hostile Witness – Admissibility ofEvidence – Settled Legal Position – Even if a witness is treated as“hostile” and is cross-examined, his evidence cannot be written offaltogether but must be considered with due care and circumspectionand that part of the testimony which is creditworthy must beconsidered and acted upon.",

“primary evidence”of the complainant is unavailable owing to his death or any otherreason – Proof of demand and acceptance of illegal gratificationby a public servant as a fact in issue by the prosecution is a sinequa non in order to establish the guilt of the accused public servantu/ss.7 and 13 (1)(d) (i) and (ii) of the Act – Prosecution has to firstprove the demand of illegal gratification and the subsequentacceptance as a matter of fact and the same can be proved bydirect evidence – The proof of demand and acceptance of illegalgratification can also be proved by circumstantial evidence in theabsence of direct oral and documentary evidence, if suchcircumstantial evidences corroborates the foundational fact ofdemand and acceptance of illegal gratification.Prevention of Corruption Act 1988: s.20 – Scope ofPresumption used therein – s.20 envisages the law regarding thepresumption where public servant accepts gratification other thanlegal remuneration – The expression used therein is “shall presume”which is legal or compulsory presumption – The said provision dealswith a legal presumption which is in the nature of a command that ithas to be presumed that the accused accepted the gratification as amotive or reward for doing or forbearing to do any official act etc.,if the condition envisaged in the former part of the Section is satisfied– It does not say that the said condition should be satisfied throughdirect evidence but the only requirement is that it must be provedthat the accused has accepted or agreed to accept gratification.Evidence Act, 1872: s.3 – Word “Fact” – “Factum Probandum& Factum Probans” – Classification and Connection – Fact consistsof state of things, events or mental state – The principal fact (fact-in-issue) constitutes Factum Probandum whereas the evidentiary fact(relevant fact) constitute Factum Probans – Facts relevant to theissue are evidentiary fact which render probable the existence ornon-existence of fact-in-issue or some other relevant fact.Evidence Act, 1872: s.3 – Word “Evidence” – Scope – Evidencemay include the actual words of witnesses, or documents produced– The term evidence is not restricted to only oral and documentaryevidence but also to other things like material objects, the demeanourof the witnesses, facts of which judicial notice could be taken,admissions of parties, local inspection made and answers given bythe accused to questions put forth by the Magistrate or Judge u/s.313 of the Criminal Procedure Code.Evidence Act, 1872 – ss. 3, 59, 60, 61 – Classification ofEvidence – Evidence may be classified as direct evidence (originalevidence) and indirect evidence (substantial evidence) – DirectEvidence establishes the existence of a thing or fact either by actualproduction or by testimony or demonstrable declaration of someonewho has himself perceived it and the same is devoid of any roomfor inference or presumption – Indirect Evidence gives rise to thelogical inference that a fact-in-issue exists, either conclusively orpresumptively – Direct Evidence may constitute either oral ordocumentary evidence – Indirect evidence may constitute evidencewhich is circumstantial in nature.Evidence Act, 1872: s.60 – Oral Evidence – Classificationand Scope – Oral Evidence can be either original or hearsay innature – It is original if it is given by the person who himself haveseen or heard something through his own senses – Hearsay Evidencecould be called as derivative, transmitted or second-hand evidencein which a witness is merely reporting what he had not himself seenor heard but have learnt from some third person – Oral Evidence isalso sub-categorized as Primary and Secondary evidence – Formeris an oral account of the original evidence while latter is a reportor an oral account of the original evidence or a copy of a documentor a model of the original thing – As per the mandate of s.60, theoral evidence must be direct or positive.Evidence Act, 1872: Word “Hearsay evidence” – Scope –The expression “hearsay evidence” is not defined under the EvidenceAct – Hearsay evidence is inadmissible to prove a fact which isdeposed to on hearsay, but it does not necessarily preclude evidenceas to a statement having been made upon which certain action wastaken or certain results followed such as evidence of an informantof the crime.Evidence Act, 1872: ss. 59, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67(2), 78– Documentary Evidence – Classification and scope – As per themandate of s.59 contents of document cannot be proved by oralevidence – Documentary evidences are to be proved by productionof documents themselves or, in their absence, by secondary evidenceu/s.65 of the Act – s.61 permits proof of contents of document byprimary or by secondary evidence – As per s.62, primary evidencemean when the document itself is produced for inspection of thecourt – For an evidence to be a secondary evidence for proving thecontents of the document, it must be of the kind as specified u/s.63– As per the mandate of s.64 document must be proved by adducingprimary evidence, except in the cases mentioned u/s.65 – The policyof law is that primary evidence is the best evidence and it affordsthe greatest certainty of the fact in question and it is only when theabsence of the primary source has been satisfactorily explainedthat secondary evidence is permissible to prove the contents ofdocuments.Evidence Act, 1872: ss. 4, 114 – Law regarding presumptions– Word “May Presume, Shall Presume, Conclusive Proof” – FactualPresumption or discretionary presumption come under “MayPresume” and in this case facts may be proved either by adducingevidence or the court may presume the existence of a fact – LegalPresumption or Compulsory Presumption come under “shallpresume” and once it is declared by the law that the court shallpresume the existence of a fact, then the court is under obligationto presume such fact unless such presumption is displaced byadducing evidence contrary to such presumption – Conclusive proofis a strict declaration of law and once a fact is declared to be aconclusive proof of the other, then the court shall not allow theevidence to be adduced to misplace such presumption – Thepresumption as contemplated by s.114 is a discretionary presumption.Evidence Act, 1872: Chapter 7 – Burden of Proof - The phrase“burden of proof” has two meanings one, the burden of proof as amatter of law and pleading and the other, the burden of establishinga case; the former is fixed as a question of law on the basis of thepleadings and is unchanged during the entire trial, whereas thelatter is not constant but shifts as soon as a party adduces sufficientevidence to raise a presumption in his favour.Evidence Act, 1872: Hostile Witness – Admissibility ofEvidence – Settled Legal Position – Even if a witness is treated as“hostile” and is cross-examined, his evidence cannot be written offaltogether but must be considered with due care and circumspectionand that part of the testimony which is creditworthy must beconsidered and acted upon.",

        "HeadNote": "Prevention of Corruption Act 1988: ss.7 and 13(1)(d) r/ws.13(2) – In the absence of evidence of the complainant (direct/primary, oral/documentary evidence) it is permissible to draw aninferential deduction of culpability/guilt of a public servant u/ss.7and 13(1)(d) r/w s.13(2) of the Act based on other evidence adducedby the prosecution.Reference Matter – Prevention of Corruption Act 1988 –Whether B. Jayaraj v State of A.P & P. Satyanarayana Murthy v D.Insp. Of Police, State of A.P. in conflict with M. Narsinga Rao v Stateof A.P – Reference Answered – There is no conflict in B. Jayarajand P. Satyanarayana Murthy with the decision in M. Narasinga Rao,with regard to the nature and quality of proof necessary to sustaina conviction for offences u/ss.7 or 13(1)(d)(i) and (ii) of the Act,when the direct evidence of the complainant or “primary evidence”of the complainant is unavailable owing to his death or any otherreason – Proof of demand and acceptance of illegal gratificationby a public servant as a fact in issue by the prosecution is a sinequa non in order to establish the guilt of the accused public servantu/ss.7 and 13 (1)(d) (i) and (ii) of the Act – Prosecution has to firstprove the demand of illegal gratification and the subsequentacceptance as a matter of fact and the same can be proved bydirect evidence – The proof of demand and acceptance of illegalgratification can also be proved by circumstantial evidence in theabsence of direct oral and documentary evidence, if suchcircumstantial evidences corroborates the foundational fact ofdemand and acceptance of illegal gratification.Prevention of Corruption Act 1988: s.20 – Scope ofPresumption used therein – s.20 envisages the law regarding thepresumption where public servant accepts gratification other thanlegal remuneration – The expression used therein is “shall presume”which is legal or compulsory presumption – The said provision dealswith a legal presumption which is in the nature of a command that ithas to be presumed that the accused accepted the gratification as amotive or reward for doing or forbearing to do any official act etc.,if the condition envisaged in the former part of the Section is satisfied– It does not say that the said condition should be satisfied throughdirect evidence but the only requirement is that it must be provedthat the accused has accepted or agreed to accept gratification.Evidence Act, 1872: s.3 – Word “Fact” – “Factum Probandum& Factum Probans” – Classification and Connection – Fact consistsof state of things, events or mental state – The principal fact (fact-in-issue) constitutes Factum Probandum whereas the evidentiary fact(relevant fact) constitute Factum Probans – Facts relevant to theissue are evidentiary fact which render probable the existence ornon-existence of fact-in-issue or some other relevant fact.Evidence Act, 1872: s.3 – Word “Evidence” – Scope – Evidencemay include the actual words of witnesses, or documents produced– The term evidence is not restricted to only oral and documentaryevidence but also to other things like material objects, the demeanourof the witnesses, facts of which judicial notice could be taken,admissions of parties, local inspection made and answers given bythe accused to questions put forth by the Magistrate or Judge u/s.313 of the Criminal Procedure Code.Evidence Act, 1872 – ss. 3, 59, 60, 61 – Classification ofEvidence – Evidence may be classified as direct evidence (originalevidence) and indirect evidence (substantial evidence) – DirectEvidence establishes the existence of a thing or fact either by actualproduction or by testimony or demonstrable declaration of someonewho has himself perceived it and the same is devoid of any roomfor inference or presumption – Indirect Evidence gives rise to thelogical inference that a fact-in-issue exists, either conclusively orpresumptively – Direct Evidence may constitute either oral ordocumentary evidence – Indirect evidence may constitute evidencewhich is circumstantial in nature.Evidence Act, 1872: s.60 – Oral Evidence – Classificationand Scope – Oral Evidence can be either original or hearsay innature – It is original if it is given by the person who himself haveseen or heard something through his own senses – Hearsay Evidencecould be called as derivative, transmitted or second-hand evidencein which a witness is merely reporting what he had not himself seenor heard but have learnt from some third person – Oral Evidence isalso sub-categorized as Primary and Secondary evidence – Formeris an oral account of the original evidence while latter is a reportor an oral account of the original evidence or a copy of a documentor a model of the original thing – As per the mandate of s.60, theoral evidence must be direct or positive.Evidence Act, 1872: Word “Hearsay evidence” – Scope –The expression “hearsay evidence” is not defined under the EvidenceAct – Hearsay evidence is inadmissible to prove a fact which isdeposed to on hearsay, but it does not necessarily preclude evidenceas to a statement having been made upon which certain action wastaken or certain results followed such as evidence of an informantof the crime.Evidence Act, 1872: ss. 59, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67(2), 78– Documentary Evidence – Classification and scope – As per themandate of s.59 contents of document cannot be proved by oralevidence – Documentary evidences are to be proved by productionof documents themselves or, in their absence, by secondary evidenceu/s.65 of the Act – s.61 permits proof of contents of document byprimary or by secondary evidence – As per s.62, primary evidencemean when the document itself is produced for inspection of thecourt – For an evidence to be a secondary evidence for proving thecontents of the document, it must be of the kind as specified u/s.63– As per the mandate of s.64 document must be proved by adducingprimary evidence, except in the cases mentioned u/s.65 – The policyof law is that primary evidence is the best evidence and it affordsthe greatest certainty of the fact in question and it is only when theabsence of the primary source has been satisfactorily explainedthat secondary evidence is permissible to prove the contents ofdocuments.Evidence Act, 1872: ss. 4, 114 – Law regarding presumptions– Word “May Presume, Shall Presume, Conclusive Proof” – FactualPresumption or discretionary presumption come under “MayPresume” and in this case facts may be proved either by adducingevidence or the court may presume the existence of a fact – LegalPresumption or Compulsory Presumption come under “shallpresume” and once it is declared by the law that the court shallpresume the existence of a fact, then the court is under obligationto presume such fact unless such presumption is displaced byadducing evidence contrary to such presumption – Conclusive proofis a strict declaration of law and once a fact is declared to be aconclusive proof of the other, then the court shall not allow theevidence to be adduced to misplace such presumption – Thepresumption as contemplated by s.114 is a discretionary presumption.Evidence Act, 1872: Chapter 7 – Burden of Proof - The phrase“burden of proof” has two meanings one, the burden of proof as amatter of law and pleading and the other, the burden of establishinga case; the former is fixed as a question of law on the

Classification ofEvidence – Evidence may be classified as direct evidence (originalevidence) and indirect evidence (substantial evidence) – DirectEvidence establishes the existence of a thing or fact either by actualproduction or by testimony or demonstrable declaration of someonewho has himself perceived it and the same is devoid of any roomfor inference or presumption – Indirect Evidence gives rise to thelogical inference that a fact-in-issue exists, either conclusively orpresumptively – Direct Evidence may constitute either oral ordocumentary evidence – Indirect evidence may constitute evidencewhich is circumstantial in nature.Evidence Act, 1872: s.60 – Oral Evidence – Classificationand Scope – Oral Evidence can be either original or hearsay innature – It is original if it is given

while latter is a reportor an oral account of the original evidence or a copy of a documentor a model of the original thing – As per the mandate of s.60, theoral evidence must be direct or positive.Evidence Act, 1872: Word “Hearsay evidence” – Scope –The expression “hearsay evidence” is not defined under the EvidenceAct – Hearsay evidence is inadmissible to prove a fact which isdeposed to on hearsay, but it does not necessarily preclude evidenceas to a statement having been made upon which certain action wastaken or certain results followed such as evidence of an informantof the

secondary evidence – As per s.62, primary evidencemean when the document itself is produced for inspection of thecourt – For an evidence to be a secondary evidence for proving thecontents of the document, it must be of the kind as specified u/s.63– As per the mandate of s.64 document must be proved by adducingprimary evidence, except in the cases mentioned u/s.65 – The policyof law is that primary evidence is the best evidence and it affordsthe greatest certainty of the fact in question and it is only when theabsence of the primary source has been satisfactorily explainedthat secondary evidence is permissible to prove the contents ofdocuments.Evidence Act, 1872: ss. 4, 114 – Law regarding presumptions– Word “May Presume, Shall Presume, Conclusive Proof” – FactualPresumption or discretionary presumption come under “MayPresume” and in this case facts may be proved either by adducingevidence or the court may presume the existence of a fact – LegalPresumption or Compulsory Presumption come under “shallpresume” and once it is declared by the law that the court shallpresume the existence of a fact, then the court is under obligationto presume such fact unless such presumption is displaced byadducing evidence contrary to such presumption – Conclusive proofis a strict declaration of law and once a fact is declared to be aconclusive proof of the other, then the court shall not allow theevidence to be adduced to misplace such presumption – Thepresumption as contemplated by s.114 is a discretionary presumption.Evidence Act, 1872: Chapter 7 – Burden of Proof - The phrase“burden of proof” has two meanings one, the burden of proof as amatter of law and pleading and the other, the burden of establishinga case; the former is fixed as a question of law on the basis of thepleadings and is unchanged during the entire trial, whereas thelatter is not constant but shifts as soon as a party adduces sufficientevidence to raise a presumption in his favour.Evidence Act, 1872: Hostile Witness – Admissibility ofEvidence – Settled Legal Position – Even if a witness is treated as“hostile” and is cross-examined, his evidence cannot be written offaltogether but must be considered with due care and circumspectionand that part of the testimony which is creditworthy must beconsidered and acted upon.",
