(NCLT), either suomotu or on an application made to it by the Central Government orby any person concerned, to take action against the auditor whohas acted in a fraudulent manner or is abetting or colluding infraud with the management of a company – If on completion of anenquiry it is found by the Tribunal that an auditor of a companyhas, whether directly or indirectly, acted in a fraudulent manner orabetted or colluded in any fraud by, or in relation to, the companyor its directors or officers, it may by order direct the company tochange its auditors – By the impugned judgment, the High Courtheld that once the auditor resigns as an auditor or is no more anauditor on his resignation, thereafter s.140(5) proceedings are nolonger maintainable – Whether after resignation of the auditors,proceedings u/s.140(5) are maintainable – Held: The view taken bythe High Court is absolutely erroneous and is unsustainable –Application / proceedings u/s.140(5) of the Act, 2013 is maintainableeven after the resignation of the concerned auditors – Enquiry/proceedings initiated under the first part of s.140(5) has to go to itslogical end and subsequent resignation and/or discontinuance ofan auditor shall not terminate the enquiry/proceedings u/s.140(5)– If interpretation given by High Court that once an auditor resigns,proceedings u/s.140(5) stand terminated and are no longer furtherrequired to be proceeded, in that case, an auditor to avoid the finalorder and the consequence of final order as provided under thesecond proviso to s.140(5) may resign and avoid any final order bythe Tribunal – That cannot be the intention of the legislature – NCLTto pass final order on such application after holding enquiry inaccordance with law and thereafter on basis of such final order, further consequences as provided under second proviso to s.140(5)shall follow.Companies Act, 2013 – s.140(5) – Constitutional validity of– s.140(5) empowers the Tribunal (NCLT), either suo motu or on anapplication made to it by the Central Government or by any personconcerned, to take action against the auditor who has acted in afraudulent manner or is abetting or colluding in fraud with themanagement of a company – If on completion of an enquiry it isfound by the Tribunal that an auditor of a company has, whetherdirectly or indirectly, acted in a fraudulent manner or abetted orcolluded in any fraud by, or in relation to, the company or its directorsor officers, it may by order direct the company to change its auditors– Held: s.140(5) is neither discriminatory, arbitrary and/or violativeof Arts. 14, 19(1)(g) of the Constitution – NCLT exercises quasi-judicial powers u/s.140(5) with all the powers akin to civil court –Ample opportunity is given by NCLT before passing any final order– Plea that s.140(5) discriminates against the auditors unfairly incomparison to similarly placed alleged perpetrators, such asdirectors, management etc. not tenable, as the role of auditors cannotbe equated with directors and/or management – Acting in afraudulent manner, directly or indirectly, by an auditor is a veryserious misconduct and therefore the necessary consequence ofindulging into such fraudulent act shall follow – Merely becausethe auditor can be removed as an auditor of a company under theother provisions, s.140(5) which has been enacted with a specialobject and purpose cannot be said to be arbitrary and/or ultra vires– Constitution of India – Arts. 14 and 19(1)(g).Companies Act, 2013 – s.140(5), first proviso – Powers underthe first proviso to s.140(5) – Nature of – Held: It can be said to beinterim or pro tem measure to prevent an existing auditor fromcontinuing and substitute him with an auditor based on a primafacie satisfaction that a fraud has been perpetrated and whencircumstances warrant the substitution – Such an order can be saidto be an interim order akin to a temporary suspension during thependency of the detailed enquiry as provided in s.140(5) and beforeany final order is passed by the Tribunal.Companies Act, 2013 – s.140(5), second proviso – Objectand purpose of – When attracted –– Held: The object and purpose  of second proviso to s.140(5) is to make the provision more stringentand to provide for consequences for an auditor when such an auditoris found to have been perpetrating a fraud and is removed by theNCLT for such fraud – Before second proviso of s.140(5) is attracted,there must be a detailed enquiry against an auditor of a companyas per first part of s.140(5) and there must be a finding arrived atby the NCLT that the auditor of a company has, directly or indirectly,acted in a fraudulent manner or abetted or colluded in any fraudby, or in relation to, the company or its directors or officers.Companies Act, 2013 – s.140(5) – Powers conferred uponthe Tribunal u/s.140(5) – If without prejudice to any action underthe provisions of the Act, 2013 or any other law for the time beingin force – Held: Irrespective of any other provisions of the Act,2013, the Tribunal is vested with powers u/s.140(5) to pass a finalorder against the auditor on the allegation that such an auditor ofthe company has, directly or indirectly, acted in a fraudulent manner.Companies Act, 2013 – s.212(14) – Quashing and settingaside of s.212(14) direction issued by Union of India to SeriousFraud Investigation Office (SFIO), by the High Court –Consequently prosecution lodged by SFIO set aside – High Courtset aside the s.212(14) direction mainly on two grounds, firstly, thatthe direction to prosecute was issued within 30 hours of report ofthe SFIO Report which demonstrates non-application of mind andsecondly on ground that SFIO Report was an incomplete report asinvestigation had not been completed and therefore s.212(14)direction was incompetent – Held: Merely because the direction toprosecute was issued within 30 hours, by that itself, it cannot bepresumed that there was a non-application of mind – What wasrequired to be considered was, whether there was any material toprosecute or not and whether the direction to prosecute was properlygiven or not – High Court also did not properly appreciate that theSFIO Report was a report prepared on completion of investigationinto IFIN – one of the companies under investigation – IFIN wasone of the subsidiaries in the IL&FS group and the financial servicesarm – Merely because investigation with respect to other subsidiarycompanies of IL&FS group might have been going on, cannot be aground to observe that so far as IFIN was concerned the reportwas incomplete – High Court materially erred that investigation in respect of IFIN was incomplete – Proceedings before the High Courtwere at the stage of direction u/s.212(14) to allow the prosecutionand the sanction to prosecute – Ample opportunity was available tothe concerned accused – Therefore, High Court erred in settingaside the direction u/s.212(14).  Companies Act, 2013 – Chapter X – Audit and Auditors –Held: Role of auditors cannot be equated with directors and/ormanagement. Words and Phrases – Word “any” used in second proviso tos.140(5) of the Act, 2013 – Meaning – Under second proviso tos.140(5), on the final order being passed by the Tribunal that theauditor/firm has, directly or indirectly, acted in a fraudulent manneror abetted or colluded in any fraud by, or in relation to, the companyor its directors or officers, he/it shall not be eligible to be appointedas an auditor of any company for a period of five years – Held:The word “any” is significant – On the final order being passed bythe Tribunal, such an auditor not only shall be removed or changedas an auditor of a company, but such an auditor/firm shall also beineligible to be appointed as an auditor of any other company for aperiod of five years – Companies Act, 2013 – s.140(5).Disposing of the appeals,",

colluding infraud with the management of a company – If on completion of anenquiry it is found by the Tribunal that an auditor of a companyhas, whether directly or indirectly, acted in a fraudulent manner orabetted or colluded in any fraud by, or in relation to, the companyor its directors or officers, it may by order direct the company tochange its auditors – By the impugned judgment, the High Courtheld that once the auditor resigns as an auditor or is no more anauditor on his resignation, thereafter s.140(5) proceedings are nolonger maintainable – Whether after resignation of the auditors,proceedings u/s.140(5) are maintainable – Held: The view taken bythe High Court is absolutely erroneous and is unsustainable –Application / proceedings u/s.140(5) of the Act, 2013 is maintainableeven after the resignation of the concerned auditors – Enquiry/proceedings initiated under the first part of s.140(5) has to go to itslogical end and subsequent resignation and/or discontinuance ofan auditor shall not terminate the enquiry/proceedings u/s.140(5)– If interpretation given by High Court that once an auditor resigns,proceedings u/s.140(5) stand terminated and are no longer furtherrequired to be proceeded, in that case, an auditor to avoid the finalorder and the consequence of final order as provided under thesecond proviso to s.140(5) may resign and avoid any final order bythe Tribunal – That cannot be the intention of the legislature – NCLTto pass final order on such application after holding enquiry inaccordance with law and thereafter on basis of such final order, further consequences as provided under second proviso to s.140(5)shall follow.Companies Act, 2013 – s.140(5) – Constitutional validity of– s.140(5) empowers the Tribunal (NCLT), either suo motu or on anapplication made to it by the Central Government or by any personconcerned, to take action against the auditor who has acted in afraudulent manner or is abetting or colluding in fraud with themanagement of a company – If on completion of an enquiry it isfound by the Tribunal that an auditor of a company has, whetherdirectly or indirectly, acted in a fraudulent manner or abetted orcolluded in any fraud by, or in relation to, the company or its directorsor officers, it may by order direct the company to change its auditors– Held: s.140(5) is neither discriminatory, arbitrary and/or violativeof Arts. 14, 19(1)(g) of the Constitution – NCLT exercises quasi-judicial powers u/s.140(5) with all the powers akin to civil court –Ample opportunity is given by NCLT before passing any final order– Plea that s.140(5) discriminates against the auditors unfairly incomparison to similarly placed alleged perpetrators, such asdirectors, management etc. not tenable, as the role of auditors cannotbe equated with directors and/or management – Acting in afraudulent manner, directly or indirectly, by an auditor is a veryserious misconduct and therefore the necessary consequence ofindulging into such fraudulent act shall follow – Merely becausethe auditor can be removed as an auditor of a company under theother provisions, s.140(5) which has been enacted with a specialobject and purpose cannot be said to be arbitrary and/or ultra vires– Constitution of India – Arts. 14 and 19(1)(g).Companies Act, 2013 – s.140(5), first proviso – Powers underthe first proviso to s.140(5) – Nature of – Held: It can be said to beinterim or pro tem measure to prevent an existing auditor fromcontinuing and substitute him with an auditor based on a primafacie satisfaction that a fraud has

in s.140(5) and beforeany final order is passed by the Tribunal.Companies Act, 2013 – s.140(5), second proviso – Objectand purpose of – When attracted –– Held: The object and purpose  of second proviso to s.140(5) is to make the provision more stringentand to provide for consequences for an auditor when such an auditoris found to have been perpetrating a fraud and is removed by theNCLT for such fraud – Before second proviso of s.140(5) is attracted,there must be a detailed enquiry against an auditor of a companyas per first part of s.140(5) and there must be a finding arrived atby the NCLT that the auditor of a company has, directly or indirectly,acted in a fraudulent manner or abetted or colluded in any fraudby, or in relation to, the company or its directors or officers.Companies Act, 2013 – s.140(5) – Powers conferred uponthe Tribunal u/s.140(5) – If without prejudice to any action underthe provisions of the Act, 2013 or any other law for the time beingin force – Held: Irrespective of any other provisions of the Act,2013, the Tribunal is vested with powers u/s.140(5) to pass a finalorder against the auditor on the allegation that such an auditor ofthe company has, directly or indirectly, acted in a fraudulent manner.Companies Act, 2013 – s.212(14) – Quashing and settingaside of s.212(14) direction issued by Union of India to SeriousFraud Investigation Office (SFIO), by the High Court –Consequently prosecution lodged by SFIO set aside – High Courtset aside the s.212(14) direction mainly on two grounds, firstly, thatthe direction to prosecute was issued within 30 hours of report ofthe SFIO Report which demonstrates non-application of mind andsecondly on ground that SFIO Report was an incomplete report asinvestigation had not been completed and therefore s.212(14)direction was incompetent – Held: Merely because the direction toprosecute was issued within 30 hours, by that itself, it cannot bepresumed that there was a non-application of mind – What wasrequired to be considered was, whether there was any material toprosecute or not and whether the direction to prosecute was properlygiven or not – High Court also did not properly appreciate that theSFIO Report was a report prepared on completion of investigationinto IFIN – one of the companies under investigation – IFIN wasone of the subsidiaries in the IL&FS group and the financial servicesarm – Merely because investigation with respect to other subsidiarycompanies of IL&FS group might have been going on, cannot be aground to observe that so far as IFIN was concerned the reportwas incomplete – High Court materially erred that investigation in respect of IFIN was incomplete – Proceedings before the High Courtwere at the stage of direction u/s.212(14) to allow the prosecutionand the sanction to prosecute – Ample opportunity was available tothe concerned accused – Therefore, High Court erred in settingaside the direction u/s.212(14).  Companies Act, 2013 – Chapter X – Audit and Auditors –Held: Role of auditors cannot be equated with directors and/ormanagement. Words and Phrases – Word “any” used in second proviso tos.140(5) of the Act, 2013 – Meaning – Under second proviso tos.140(5), on the final order being passed by the Tribunal that theauditor/firm has, directly or indirectly, acted in a fraudulent manneror abetted or colluded in any fraud by, or in relation to, the companyor its directors or officers, he/it shall not be eligible to be appointedas an auditor of any company for a period of five years – Held:The word “any” is significant – On the final order being passed bythe Tribunal, such an auditor not only shall be removed or changedas an auditor of a company, but such an auditor/firm shall also beineligible to be appointed as an auditor of any other company for aperiod of five years – Companies Act, 2013 – s.140(5).Disposing of the appeals,",

Courtheld that once the auditor resigns as an auditor or is no more anauditor on his resignation, thereafter s.140(5) proceedings are nolonger maintainable – Whether after resignation of the auditors,proceedings u/s.140(5) are maintainable – Held: The view taken bythe High Court is absolutely erroneous and is unsustainable –Application / proceedings u/s.140(5) of the Act, 2013 is

discontinuance ofan auditor shall not terminate the enquiry/proceedings u/s.140(5)– If interpretation given by High Court that once an auditor resigns,proceedings u/s.140(5) stand terminated and are no longer furtherrequired to be proceeded, in that case, an auditor to avoid the finalorder and the consequence of final order as provided under thesecond proviso to s.140(5) may resign and avoid any

auditors cannotbe equated with directors and/or management – Acting in afraudulent manner, directly or indirectly, by an auditor is a veryserious misconduct and therefore the necessary consequence ofindulging into such fraudulent act shall follow – Merely becausethe auditor can be removed as an auditor of a company under theother provisions, s.140(5) which has been enacted with a specialobject and purpose cannot be said to be arbitrary and/or ultra vires– Constitution of India – Arts. 14 and 19(1)(g).Companies Act, 2013 – s.140(5), first proviso – Powers underthe first proviso to s.140(5) – Nature of – Held: It can be said to beinterim or pro tem measure to prevent an existing auditor fromcontinuing and substitute him with an auditor based on a primafacie satisfaction that a fraud has

NCLT that the auditor of a company has, directly or indirectly,acted in a fraudulent manner or abetted or colluded in any fraudby, or in relation to, the company or its directors or officers.Companies

(SFIO), by the High Court –Consequently prosecution lodged by SFIO set aside – High Courtset aside the s.212(14) direction mainly on two grounds, firstly, thatthe direction to prosecute was issued within 30 hours of report ofthe SFIO Report which demonstrates non-application of mind andsecondly on ground that SFIO Report was an incomplete report asinvestigation had not been completed and therefore s.212(14)direction was incompetent – Held: Merely because the direction toprosecute was issued within 30 hours, by that itself, it cannot bepresumed that there was a non-application of mind – What wasrequired to be considered was, whether there was any material toprosecute or not and whether the direction to prosecute was properlygiven or not – High Court also did not properly appreciate that theSFIO Report was a report prepared on completion of investigationinto IFIN – one of the companies under investigation – IFIN wasone of the subsidiaries in the IL&FS group and the financial servicesarm – Merely because investigation with respect to other subsidiarycompanies of IL&FS group might have been going on, cannot be aground to observe that so far as IFIN was concerned the reportwas incomplete – High Court materially erred that investigation in respect of IFIN was incomplete – Proceedings before the High Courtwere at the stage of direction u/s.212(14) to allow the prosecutionand the sanction to prosecute – Ample opportunity was available tothe concerned accused – Therefore, High Court erred in settingaside the direction u/s.212(14).

Arif’s case, order dismissing the review petitionthrough circulation recalled and the petition heard in open Court –Held: None of the grounds raised amount to errors apparent on theface of the record – All the grounds fail to raise any reasonabledoubt in the prosecution case – Thus, no reason to interfere withthe concurrent findings of the trial court, the High Court and thisCourt vis-a-vis the guilt of the petitioner for kidnapping andmurdering the victim – Even though the crime committed by thepetitioner is unquestionably grave and unpardonable, it is notappropriate to affirm the death sentence awarded to him – ‘Rarestof rare’ doctrine requires that the death sentence not be imposedonly by taking into account the grave nature of crime but only ifthere is no possibility of reformation in a criminal – No mitigatingcircumstances were placed before any of the appellate courts – Itcannot be said that there is no possibility of reformation even thoughthe petitioner has committed a ghastly crime – Also it was submittedthat the hearing was not conducted separately in the trial court –Thus, in view of the gruesome nature of the crime of murder of 7year old child, the death sentence is commuted to life imprisonment for not less than twenty years without reprieve or remission –Supreme Court Rules 2013 – Ord. XLVII r. 1.  Sentence/sentencing:Capital punishment – Mitigating circumstances –Consideration of, while deciding upon the sentence – Held: Dutyof the court is to enquire into mitigating circumstances as well as toforeclose the possibility of reformation and rehabilitation beforeimposing the death penalty – State must equally place all materialand circumstances on the record bearing on the probability of reform– Many such materials and aspects are within the knowledge of theState which has had custody of the accused both before and afterthe conviction – Moreover, the court cannot be an indifferent by-stander in the process – Process and powers of the court may beutilised to ensure that such material is made available to it to form ajust sentencing decision bearing on the probability of reform. Capital punishment – Aggravating circumstances –Consideration of, while deciding upon the sentence – Held: Sex ofthe child cannot be in itself considered as an aggravatingcircumstance – Murder of a young child is a grievous crime and theyoung age of the victim as well as the trauma caused to the entirefamily is in itself, an aggravating circumstance – It does not andshould not matter for a constitutional court whether the young childwas a male child or a female child – Courts should not indulge infurthering the notion that only a male child furthers family lineageor is able to assist the parents in old age – Such remarks involuntarilyfurther patriarchal value judgments that courts should avoid.

Arif’s case, order dismissing the review petitionthrough circulation recalled and the petition heard in open Court –Held: None of the grounds raised amount to errors apparent on theface of the record – All the grounds fail to raise any reasonabledoubt in the prosecution case – Thus, no reason to interfere withthe concurrent findings of the trial court, the High Court and thisCourt vis-a-vis the guilt of the petitioner for kidnapping andmurdering the victim – Even though the crime committed by thepetitioner is unquestionably grave and unpardonable, it is notappropriate to affirm the death sentence awarded to him – ‘Rarestof rare’ doctrine requires that the death sentence not be imposedonly by taking into account the grave nature of crime but only ifthere is no possibility of reformation in a criminal – No mitigatingcircumstances were placed before any of the appellate courts – Itcannot be said that there is no possibility of reformation even thoughthe petitioner has committed a ghastly crime – Also it was submittedthat the hearing was not conducted separately in the trial court –Thus, in view of the gruesome nature of the crime of murder of 7year old child, the death sentence is commuted to life imprisonment for not less than twenty years without reprieve or remission –Supreme Court Rules 2013 – Ord.

Capital punishment – Aggravating circumstances –Consideration of, while deciding upon the sentence – Held: Sex ofthe child cannot be in itself considered as an aggravatingcircumstance – Murder of a young child is a grievous crime and theyoung age of the victim as well as the trauma caused to the entirefamily is in itself, an aggravating circumstance – It does not andshould not matter for a constitutional court whether the young childwas a male child or a female child – Courts should not indulge infurthering the notion that only a male child furthers family lineageor is able to assist the parents in old age – Such remarks involuntarilyfurther patriarchal value judgments that courts should avoid.
