Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest Act, 2002 – ss. 14, 35 and 37 – Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 – Does Provisions of the 2002 Act override the provisions of the Cr.P.C, whereunder the functions to be discharged by the CMM are similar to that of the CJM – Held: The expressions ‘CMM’ and ‘CJM’ are used interchangeably in Cr. P.C. and are considered as synonymous to each other – s.14, even if read literally, in no manner denotes that allocation of jurisdictions and powers to CMM and CJM under the Code of Criminal Procedure are modified by the 2002 Act – Thus understood, s.14 of the 2002 Act, stricto sensu, cannot be construed as being inconsistent with the provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure or vice-versa in that regard – Further, s.37 of the 2002 Act predicates that the provisions of the 2002 Act or the Rules made thereunder shall be in addition to the stated enactments or “any other law for the time being in force” – Having said that the Provisions of the s.14 of the 2002 Act are in no way inconsistent with the provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure, it must then follow that the provisions of the 2002 Act are in addition to and not in derogation of the Code.",

Specific Relief Act, 1963: s.16(1)(c) – Suit for specific performance of contract – Readiness and willingness of plaintiff to perform his part of contract – Trial Court decreed the suit on 01.06.1994 and granted time to the plaintiff for deposit of the balance consideration within two months – Plaintiff offered no explanation whatsoever for the failure to comply the direction – After expiry of the time granted for deposit, plaintiff filed an application before the Trial Court that in view of the pendency of the First Appeal preferred by defendants, the time for deposit may be extended as otherwise the amount would lie in the bank without interest – Time for deposit was extended till disposal of the First Appeal – Held: The failure of the plaintiff to offer any explanation why the balance consideration was not deposited within the time granted, the filing of the application for extension of time after expiry of the prescribed period coupled with the frivolousness of the grounds taken in the application for extension that the money would lie in the bank without earning interest, were all but evidence of incapacity on part of the plaintiff to perform his obligations under the agreement and reflective of lack of readiness and willingness – The grant of relief for specific performance under s.16(1)(c) of the Act is a discretionary and equitable relief – The plea that the amount would lie in the bank without interest is unfounded and contrary to normal banking practice – This is sufficient evidence of the incapacity or lack of readiness and willingness on part of the plaintiff to perform his obligations – Undoubtedly, the time for deposit could be extended under s.28 of the Act – But the mere extension of time for deposit does not absolve the plaintiff of his obligation to demonstrate readiness and willingness coupled with special circumstances beyond his control to seek such extension – The pendency of an appeal by the defendant did not preclude the plaintiff from depositing the amount in proof of his readiness and willingness – High Court has rightly observed that there was no stay by the Appellate Court of the decree under appeal to justify non-deposit during the pendency of the appeal – There was no infirmity in the order of the High Court concluding that the plaintiff in the facts and circumstances was not ready and willing to perform his obligations."

Karnataka Industrial Areas Development Board (2015) 5 SCC 244:[2014] 3 SCR 710 apply to the facts of this case – The WBSIDC acted within the bounds of law – The finding that since the exercise by the lessor (WBSIDC) of its right to determine the lease attained finality, the mortgagee (represented by the appellant) could not claim rights superior to that of the lessee, is in consonance with settled law – The reasoning and conclusion of the High Court requires no interference.",

Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973: s.313 – Plea of appellant that they were seriously prejudiced in their defence because proper opportunity to defend was denied under s.313 as the incriminating questions put to them were extremely casual and perfunctory – Held: s.313 incorporates the principle of audi alteram partem – It provides an opportunity to the accused for his defence by making him aware fully of the prosecution allegations against him and to answer the same in support of his innocence – But equally there cannot be a generalised presumption of prejudice to an accused merely by reason of any omission or inadequate questions put to him – Ultimately it will be a question to be considered in the facts and circumstances of each case including the nature of other evidence available, the kind of questions put to an accused, considered with anything further that the accused may state in his defence – In the facts of the instant case, considering the nature of ocular evidence available of the injured witnesses P.Ws. 7 and 8 who were also cross-examined by the appellants, no prejudice was caused to the appellants – A specific question was put to the appellants that they participated in an unlawful assembly with the common object of murdering the deceased – Further, it was also put to them that they had caused injuries to P.W. 7 and 8 – Merely because no questions were put to the appellants with regard to the individual assault made by each of them, it cannot be said in the facts of the case that any prejudice was caused to them – Appellants did not offer any explanation or desire to lead evidence except for stating that they were falsely implicated. Criminal Law: Absence of injury report of injured eye witnesses – Effect on prosecution case – Prosecution case was that P.W. 8 and deceased were going together when they were surrounded and assaulted by the accused persons – There was no lacunae in the evidence or cross-examination of the witness to doubt his presence and the injuries suffered by him in the same occurrence – P.W. 7, a resident of the locality and an independent witness also suffered injuries during the same occurrence – P.W. 8 during the course of his deposition also showed the scars caused to him by his injuries, noticed by the trial judge – The statement of the two witnesses also stated to have been recorded at the hospital – The fact that there was no injury report, can at best be classified as a defective investigation but cannot raise doubts about the credibility of their being injured witnesses in the same occurrence – The officer-in\u0002charge of the police station where the deceased and injured were taken, specifically deposed that he submitted a request for the injury report of the witnesses and pursuant to which their injury reports were made available to him – Only thereafter the charge sheet was submitted by him – There was no material in his cross-examination to discredit his statements – Investigation, defect in. Penal Code, 1860: ss.302/149 and ss.323/149 – Conviction under – Appellants were undoubtedly the members of an unlawful assembly some of whom were also armed with spears and assaulted the deceased – All the accused surrounded the deceased obviously to prevent his escape – The initial assault was made on the head of the deceased with the lathi by appellant-S – The deceased fell down and when he was trying to stand up, he was assaulted by two persons with spears – P.W. 7 was assaulted on the head by appellant-F – In the fracas the fact that the assault by appellant-M landed on the thigh of the witness was not of much relevance – Likewise, P.W. 8 was assaulted by appellant-S on the face and head – The fact that the co-accused may have assaulted on the head again cannot be considered very relevant to eschew the absence of common object – No reason to interfere with the order of conviction.",

        "HeadNote": "Penal Code, 1860: ss.302/149 and ss.323/149 and s.147 – Conviction under – Plea of appellant that charge was framed under ss.302/149 and ss.323/149 against six persons but charge under s.147 was against four persons only and therefore was defective without aid of s.141 and s.146 – Held: Originally there were six accused – Two of them have since been deceased – Appellants were well aware that six of them were charged together for a common assault under ss.302/149 and 323/149 because of their sharing a common object – Appellants were also aware that two of the accused were carrying a deadly weapon, spears, and which were used for assault – Therefore, omission by the court in framing charge under s.147 alone against four persons only was a mere inadvertent omission – Moreover, objection about a defective charge, without any evidence of the prejudice caused, was raised for the first time in the instant appeal and for that reason also did not merit consideration. Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973: s.313 – Plea of appellant that they were seriously prejudiced in their defence because proper opportunity to defend was denied under s.313 as the incriminating questions put to them were extremely casual and perfunctory – Held: s.313 incorporates the principle of audi alteram partem – It provides an opportunity to the accused for his defence by making him aware fully of the prosecution allegations against him and to answer the same in support of his innocence – But equally there cannot be a generalised presumption of prejudice to an accused merely by reason of any omission or inadequate questions put to him – Ultimately it will be a question to be considered in the facts and circumstances of each case including the nature of other evidence available, the kind of questions put to an accused, considered with anything further that the accused may state in his defence – In the facts of the instant case, considering the nature of ocular evidence available of the injured witnesses P.Ws. 7 and 8 who were also cross-examined by the appellants, no prejudice was caused to the appellants – A specific question was put to the appellants that they participated in an unlawful assembly with the common object of murdering the deceased – Further, it was also put to them that they had caused injuries to P.W. 7 and 8 – Merely because no questions were put to the appellants with regard to the individual assault made by each of them, it cannot be said in the facts of the case that any prejudice was caused to them – Appellants did not offer any explanation or desire to lead evidence except for stating that they were falsely implicated. Criminal Law: Absence of injury report of injured eye witnesses – Effect on prosecution case – Prosecution case was that P.W. 8 and deceased were going together when they were surrounded and assaulted by the accused persons – There was no lacunae in the evidence or cross-examination of the witness to doubt his presence and the injuries suffered by him in the same occurrence – P.W. 7, a resident of the locality and an independent witness also suffered injuries during the same occurrence – P.W. 8 during the course of his deposition also showed the scars caused to him by his injuries, noticed by the trial judge – The statement of the two witnesses also stated to have been recorded at the hospital – The fact that there was no injury report, can at best be classified as a defective investigation but cannot raise doubts about the credibility of their being injured witnesses in the same occurrence – The officer-in\u0002charge of the police station where the deceased and injured were taken, specifically deposed that he submitted a request for the injury report of the witnesses and pursuant to which their injury reports were made available to him – Only thereafter the charge sheet was submitted by him – There was no material in his cross-examination to discredit his statements – Investigation, defect in. Penal Code, 1860: ss.302/149 and ss.323/149 – Conviction under – Appellants were undoubtedly the members of an unlawful assembly some of whom were also armed with spears and assaulted the deceased – All the accused surrounded the deceased obviously to prevent his escape – The initial assault was made on the head of the deceased with the lathi by appellant-S – The deceased fell down and when he was trying to stand up, he was assaulted by two persons with spears – P.W. 7 was assaulted on the head by appellant-F – In the fracas the fact that the assault by appellant-M landed on the thigh of the witness was not of much relevance – Likewise, P.W. 8 was assaulted by appellant-S on the face and head – The fact that the co-accused may have assaulted on the head again cannot be considered very relevant to eschew the absence of common object – No reason to interfere with the order of conviction.",
