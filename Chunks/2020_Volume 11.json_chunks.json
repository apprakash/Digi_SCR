and (ii) after holding an enquiry in such manner as may beprescribed by Rules, has to determine the correct value of theconcerned property – The Section by itself does not lay down anyperiod within which the entire process is to be completed by theCollector – It simply states that the enquiry be held in “such manner”as may be prescribed by Rules – If the stipulation or fixation ofperiod of three months from the first notice in terms of r.6 or fromnotice in Form II is taken to be mandatory, it would lead to asituation of incongruity – The fact that Form II notice had beenissued, would mean that on a prima facie view of the record andmaterial, the value stated in the instrument was not the correct value;which in turn would mean that prima facie the Government Cofferswere being denied the rightful dues – If for any reason, theproceedings are not completed within three months and, therefore,must be held to be vitiated, the public interest would suffer, and thepersons who were prime facie responsible for suppressing real valuewould stand to gain – The amendment of r.7 incorporating the periodof three months was essentially to guide the public officials tocomplete the process as early as possible but was not intended tocreate a right in favour of those who had prima facie conductedthemselves prejudicing public interest – Pertinently, the concernedprovision has not spelt out any consequence for non-adherence tosaid period of three months – The fixation of timeline of three monthsin r.7 is, therefore, purely directory – Stamp Act, 1899 – s.47A.Stamp Act, 1899: s.47A – Whether the appellate authority haspower under s.47A of the Act to enhance the market value of theproperty while deciding the appeal filed by the registrants – Held:Sub-section (6) of s.47-A of the Act empowers the Chief ControllingRevenue Authority, in exercise of suo motu power, to call for andexamine the correctness of an order passed under sub-section (2)or sub-section (3) of s.47-A; and if the order is prejudicial to theinterest of Revenue, the Chief Controlling Authority may make suchenquiry or cause such enquiry to be made and either revise, modifyor set aside such order and pass any order that it deems appropriate– There are some limitations on the exercise of said power, since noproceedings can be initiated against an order passed under sub-section (2) or sub-section (3), if the time for preferring an appealagainst that order has not expired, or if more than five years haveexpired after passing of the order – The intent is clear that if therebe sufficient time to prefer a regular appeal challenging that order,the remedy of filing an appeal ought to be taken resort to – Further,if the period of five years has expired, no suo motu power can beexercised – Another limitation is prescribed by sub-section (8), interms of which no order in exercise of suo motu exercise of powercan be passed which may adversely impact a person, unless thatperson has had reasonable opportunity of being heard – Apart fromthese limitations, the statutory provisions do not impose any otherrestriction, and the power is conferred principally to ensure that noorder passed under sub-sections (2) or (3) of s.47-A is prejudicialto the interest of the revenue – In the present case, while proposingto enhance the market value higher than what was determined bythe Collector, the appellate authority had put the appellant-registrantto sufficient notice and had called for response with regard to theproposed enhancement – It was nobody’s case that as on the datewhen the proceedings were initiated in exercise of the power undersub-section (6) of s.47-A, the period for preferring the appeal hadnot expired, or that more than five years had expired after the passingof the order under sub-section (2) or sub-section (3) – In thecircumstances, none of the limitations which the statute has imposedupon the exercise of power were present – It is not as if theassessment made by the appellate authority was either opposed toprinciples of natural justice, or was so palpably incorrect, that itcould never be sustained – The exercise of power was definitelydesigned to obviate an obvious illegality and prejudice to the interestof the revenue – The exercise was, thus, absolutely correct, andthere was no occasion to set aside the orders passed in pursuancethereof.",

and (ii) after holding an enquiry in such manner as may beprescribed by Rules, has to determine the correct value of theconcerned property – The Section by itself does not lay down anyperiod within which the entire process is to be completed by theCollector – It simply states that the enquiry be held in “such manner”as may be prescribed by Rules – If the stipulation or fixation ofperiod of three months from the first notice in terms of r.6 or fromnotice in Form II is taken to be mandatory, it would lead to asituation of incongruity – The fact that Form II notice had beenissued, would mean that on a prima facie view of the record andmaterial, the value stated in the instrument was not the correct value;which in turn would mean that prima facie the Government Cofferswere being denied the rightful dues – If for any reason, theproceedings are not completed within three months and, therefore,must be held to be vitiated, the public interest would suffer, and thepersons who were prime facie responsible for suppressing real valuewould stand to gain – The amendment of r.7 incorporating the periodof three months was essentially to guide the public officials tocomplete the process as early as possible but was not intended tocreate a right in favour of those who had prima facie conductedthemselves prejudicing public interest – Pertinently, the concernedprovision has not spelt out any consequence for non-adherence tosaid period of three months – The fixation of timeline of three monthsin r.7 is, therefore, purely directory – Stamp Act, 1899 – s.47A.Stamp Act, 1899: s.47A – Whether the appellate authority haspower under s.47A of the Act to enhance the market value of theproperty while deciding the appeal filed by the registrants – Held:Sub-section (6) of s.47-A of the Act empowers the Chief ControllingRevenue Authority, in exercise of suo motu power, to call for andexamine the correctness of an order passed under sub-section (2)or sub-section (3) of s.47-A; and if the order is prejudicial to theinterest of Revenue, the Chief Controlling Authority may make suchenquiry or cause such enquiry to be made and either revise, modifyor set aside such order and pass any order that it deems appropriate– There are some limitations on the exercise of said power, since noproceedings can be initiated against an order passed under sub-section (2) or sub-section (3), if the time for preferring an appealagainst that order has not expired, or if more than five years haveexpired after passing of the order – The intent is clear that if therebe sufficient time to prefer a regular appeal challenging that order,the remedy of filing an appeal ought to be taken resort to – Further,if the period of five years has expired, no suo motu power can beexercised – Another limitation is prescribed by sub-section (8), interms of which no order in exercise of suo motu exercise of powercan be passed which may adversely impact a person, unless thatperson has had reasonable opportunity of being heard – Apart fromthese limitations, the statutory provisions do not impose any otherrestriction, and the power is conferred principally to ensure that noorder passed under sub-sections (2) or (3) of s.47-A is prejudicialto the interest of the revenue – In the present case, while proposingto enhance the market value higher than what was determined bythe Collector, the appellate authority had put the appellant-registrantto sufficient notice and had called for response with regard to theproposed enhancement – It was nobody’s case that as on the datewhen the proceedings were initiated in exercise of the power undersub-section (6) of s.47-A, the period for preferring the appeal hadnot expired, or that more than five years had expired after the passingof the order under sub-section (2) or sub-section (3) – In thecircumstances, none of the limitations which the statute has imposedupon the exercise of power were present – It is not as if theassessment made by the appellate authority was either opposed toprinciples of natural justice, or was so palpably incorrect, that itcould never be sustained – The exercise of power was definitelydesigned to obviate an obvious illegality and prejudice to the interestof the revenue – The exercise was, thus, absolutely correct, andthere was no occasion to set aside the orders passed in pursuancethereof."

date of ordersought to be reopened and the date of issuance of show-causenotice under s.15 of the Ceiling Act of 1973.Rajasthan Tenancy Act, 1955 – ss.30C, 30D, 30DD – Ceilinglimit – Appellant was owner of 254.2 bighas of land – On19.12.1963, he gifted away 127.1 bighas of land to his son andthereafter he was left with 17.25 standard acres of land – Proceedingwas initiated under the ceiling law but same was dropped on14.04.1972 with observation that amendment of s.30DD of the Act,1955 was effective from 31.12.1969 and since the gift deed wasexecuted before the said amendment, the said transfer was valid –By notice dated 15.03.1982, the Revenue Ceiling Department re-opened the case of the appellant – Authorities held that the appellantwas holding land over and above the ceiling limit – High Court,while passing the impugned order, held the registered gift deed dated19.12.1963 to be invalid on the basis that it did not meet therequirements as provided under s.122 of the Transfer of PropertyAct, 1882 – High Court observed that gift deed did not showacceptance of gift by the donee, rather it seemed that donee waseven unaware of the gift – High Court held that appellant washolding 4.5 standard acres of land in excess of ceiling limit –Aggrieved land owner filed instant appeal – Held: The recitals inthe gift deed indicated that donor intended to part with ownershipand possession immediately after the execution of the gift deed –Mutation entry in the Revenue Record reflected that half portion ofappellant’s land was bestowed as a gift by him to his son through aregistered instrument of gift – Even in the statement of the appellant,he has stated that the transferee-son was living separately and wascultivating the said gifted property and that he was in possession ofan ox and equipments for ploughing and agriculture – These factswere reiterated by the transferee also in his statement – Thestatements of transferor and the transferee clearly indicated thatthe transferee had the equipment and skills and was sustaininghimself as an agriculturalist – Lastly, the said transfer was executedway before the cut-off date stipulated under s.30DD i.e. 31.12.1969– Therefore, the registered gift deed was a bona fide transfersquarely covered within the ambits of s.30DD, which intended toprotect the rights of agriculturalists – The transfer of the land beingvalid under s.30DD, the ceiling area of the appellant fell within theceiling limit as provided under s.30C – Rajasthan Imposition ofCeiling on Agricultural Holdings Act, 1973.Transfer of Property Act, 1882: ss.122, 123 – Whether theregistered gift deed executed by appellant was valid in the eyes oflaw – Held: For a gift to be valid, it must be gratuitous in natureand must be made voluntarily – The said giving away implies acomplete dispossession of the ownership in the property by the donor– Acceptance of a gift by the donee can be done anytime during thelifetime of the donor – Act of receiving willingly, acceptance can beinferred by the implied conduct of the donee – The recitals in thegift deed indicated that donor intended to part with ownership andpossession immediately after the execution of the gift deed –Mutation Record clearly reflected that half portion of appellant’sland was bestowed as a gift by him to his son through a registeredinstrument of gift – Furthermore, the statement rendered by theappellant before the Additional District Magistrate indicated thatthe donee was already a major at the time of the execution of thegift deed and after execution of the gift deed the donee startedcultivating on the same – This statement of the appellant wascompletely supported by the statement made by the donee beforethe Additional District Magistrate in which donee had stated that,as he did not get along with his step-mother, he started livingseparately and the land was transferred to him by virtue of giftdeed was under his possession and he was cultivating the same –Therefore, these circumstances clearly indicated that there was anacceptance of the gift by the donee during the lifetime of the donor– Respondents failed to bring on record any evidence to rebut thefact that the donee was in enjoyment of the property – In light ofthe same, the Single Judge Bench took a plausible view that, it wasa transfer between a father and a son and there was a validacceptance of the gift when the donee-son started living separately– Lastly, since it was registered deed bearing signature of the donorand attested by two witnesses, the requirements under s.123 of theTransfer of Property Act, 1882 were satisfied – Gift deed – RajasthanImposition of Ceiling on Agricultural Holdings Act, 1973 – RajasthanTenancy Act, 1955.Rajasthan Imposition of Ceiling on Agricultural Holdings Act,1973 – s.6 – Applicability of – Held: s.6 of the Ceiling Act of 1973declares that every transfer of land including by way of gift, madeon or after 26-09-1970 and before 01-01-1973, shall be deemed tohave been made to defeat the provisions of the Ceiling Act of 1973– In the instant case, the gift deed was executed on 19-12-1963,that is much before 26-09-1970 – Therefore, s.6 of the Ceiling Actof 1973 does not affect the transfer of land by the appellant-donorin favour of the donee-son – Also, there is no finding that the giftdeed in this case was actuated upon any extraneous consideration– Hence, it constituted a bona fide transfer which are exemptedfrom the rigors of s.6 of the Ceiling Act of 1973.Words and Phrases: Word ‘acceptance’ – Meaning of.",

date of ordersought to be reopened and the date of issuance of show-causenotice under s.15 of the Ceiling Act of 1973.Rajasthan Tenancy Act, 1955 – ss.30C, 30D, 30DD – Ceilinglimit – Appellant was owner of 254.2 bighas of land – On19.12.1963, he gifted away 127.1 bighas of land to his son andthereafter he was left with 17.25 standard acres of land – Proceedingwas initiated under the ceiling law but same was dropped on14.04.1972 with observation that amendment of s.30DD of the Act,1955 was effective from 31.12.1969 and since the gift deed wasexecuted before the said amendment, the said transfer was valid –By notice dated 15.03.1982, the Revenue Ceiling Department re-opened the case of the appellant – Authorities held that the appellantwas holding land over and above the ceiling limit – High Court,while passing the impugned order, held the registered gift deed dated19.12.1963 to be invalid on the basis that it did not meet therequirements as provided under s.122 of the Transfer of PropertyAct, 1882 – High Court observed that gift deed did not showacceptance of gift by the donee, rather it seemed that donee waseven unaware of the gift – High Court held that appellant washolding 4.5 standard acres of land in excess of ceiling limit –Aggrieved land owner filed instant appeal – Held: The recitals inthe gift deed indicated that donor intended to part with ownershipand possession immediately after the execution of the gift deed –Mutation entry in the Revenue Record reflected that half portion ofappellant’s land was bestowed as a gift by him to his son through aregistered instrument of gift – Even in the statement of the appellant,he has stated that the transferee-son was living separately and wascultivating the said gifted property and that he was in possession ofan ox and equipments for ploughing and agriculture – These factswere reiterated by the transferee also in his statement – Thestatements of transferor and the transferee clearly indicated thatthe transferee had the equipment and skills and was sustaininghimself as an agriculturalist – Lastly, the said transfer was executedway before the cut-off date stipulated under s.30DD i.e. 31.12.1969– Therefore, the registered gift deed was a bona fide transfersquarely covered within the ambits of s.30DD, which intended toprotect the rights of agriculturalists – The transfer of the land beingvalid under s.30DD, the ceiling area of the appellant fell within theceiling limit as provided under s.30C – Rajasthan Imposition ofCeiling on Agricultural Holdings Act, 1973.Transfer of Property Act, 1882: ss.122, 123 – Whether theregistered gift deed executed by appellant was valid in the eyes oflaw – Held: For a gift to be valid, it must be gratuitous in natureand must be made voluntarily – The said giving away implies acomplete dispossession of the ownership in the property by the donor– Acceptance of a gift by the donee can be done anytime during thelifetime of the donor – Act of receiving willingly, acceptance can beinferred by the implied conduct of the donee – The recitals in thegift deed indicated that donor intended to part with ownership andpossession immediately after the execution of the gift deed –Mutation Record clearly reflected that half portion of appellant’sland was bestowed as a gift by him to his son through a registeredinstrument of gift – Furthermore, the statement rendered by theappellant before the Additional District Magistrate indicated thatthe donee was already a major at the time of the execution of thegift deed and after execution of the gift deed the donee startedcultivating on the same – This statement of the appellant wascompletely supported by the statement made by the donee beforethe Additional District Magistrate in which donee had stated that,as he did not get along with his step-mother, he started livingseparately and the land was transferred to him by virtue of giftdeed was under his possession and he was cultivating the same –Therefore, these circumstances clearly indicated that there was anacceptance of the gift by the donee during the lifetime of the donor– Respondents failed to bring on record any evidence to rebut thefact that the donee was in enjoyment of the property – In light ofthe same, the Single Judge Bench took a plausible view that, it wasa transfer between a father and a son and there was a validacceptance of the gift when the donee-son started living separately– Lastly, since it was registered deed bearing signature of the donorand attested by two witnesses, the requirements under s.123 of theTransfer of Property Act, 1882 were satisfied – Gift deed – RajasthanImposition of Ceiling on Agricultural Holdings Act, 1973 – RajasthanTenancy Act, 1955.Rajasthan Imposition of Ceiling on Agricultural Holdings Act,1973 – s.6 – Applicability of – Held: s.6 of the Ceiling Act of 1973declares that every transfer of land including by way of gift, madeon or after 26-09-1970 and before 01-01-1973, shall be deemed tohave been made to defeat the provisions of the Ceiling Act of 1973– In the instant case, the gift deed was executed on 19-12-1963,that is much before 26-09-1970 – Therefore, s.6 of the Ceiling Actof 1973 does not affect the transfer of land by the appellant-donorin favour of the donee-son – Also, there is no finding that the giftdeed in this case was actuated upon any extraneous consideration– Hence, it constituted a bona fide transfer which are exemptedfrom the rigors of s.6 of the Ceiling Act of 1973.Words and Phrases: Word ‘acceptance’ – Meaning of."

        "HeadNote": " Tender – Rejection of bid on ground of omission and suppression of relevant fact – Public Works Department of the State issued a Notice Inviting Tender (NIT) for the construction of an Elevated Corridor (Flyover) of a length of 7.473 Km – Eleven Companies bid for the said project including UPSBC, ‘R’ Builders and ‘Ra’ Construction Co. – The State rejected bid of UPSBC of sum of Rs. 306.27 crores on the ground that the bidder suppressed information required under paragraph 13 of Appendix-I-A and clause 7(b) of Annex-I of NIT – Hence, the bid of UPSBC was considered to be non-responsive – Likewise, ‘Ra’ Construction Co. bid for Rs. 293.25 crores did not fulfil the criteria under clause 2.2.2.2(ii) of the NIT for ‘one similar work’ of 25% of the estimated project cost and was, therefore, considered non-responsive – One ‘R’ builders had bid for Rs.315.80 crores – The High Court in the Writ Petition filed by UPSBC, held that as on date of submission of the technical bid, since no investigation was pending within the meaning of clause 7(b) of Annex-I, there was no suppression of facts, despite the fact that an FIR had been lodged against it in respect of a bridge constructed by it earlier and the bridge had collapsed killing & injuring people – The High Court directed to issue a Letter of Intent in favour of UPSBC – As far as writ petition filed by ‘Ra’ Construction Co. is concerned, the High Court referred to clause 2.2.2.2(ii) of the NIT and held that there was nothing wrong with the State’s rejection – On appeal, held : The UPSBC is right when it refers and relies on the format which had to be strictly complied with and going by the literal reading of the format for providing declaration, which only required a disclosure of pending investigations under clause 7(b) of Annex-I of the NIT – However, the paragraph 13 of Appendix-I-A must be read together with paragraph 11 thereof, which required the bidder to certify that in regard to matters other than security and integrity of the country, the bidder was not convicted by a Court of law or indicted – Clearly, in the instant case, though the investigation was no longer pending and though there was no conviction by a Court of law, UPSBC was certainly ‘indicted’, in that, a charge-sheet was filed against it relatable to the FIR – So, there is an omission of a most relevant fact and suppression of the same fact, namely that an FIR was lodged against UPSBC in respect of the construction of a bridge by it – As a result, UPSBC is disqualified – As far as ‘Ra’ Construction is concerned, it will not be open for a Constitutional Court to substitute their view of the view of the tendering authority, when it reads clause 2.2.2.2(ii) in the manner that was done – Therefore, the State directed to issue Letter of Intent to ‘R’ Builders as far as present tender is concerned at the same financial bid as that of UPSBC.

ofNational Disaster Management Authority of the year 2019 doesnot deal with situations arising out of the current pandemic andhas no mention of measures like lockdown, containment zones,

andguidelines as contemplated by the statute for Disaster Managementis by its very nature prior to the occurrence of any disaster and asa measure of preparedness – It is not conceivable that a NationalPlan would be framed after the disaster has occurred – A NationalPlan encompasses and contemplate all kinds of disasters – TheBiological and Public health emergencies has already beencontemplated in the National Plan, 2019, which as notified in table1-1 under paragraph 1.13.1 specifically includes epidemics: Viral,Bacterial, Parasitic, Fungal and prior infections – NovelCoronavirus is an epidemic which has become pandemic – Plan-2019 is complemented by several plans, Standard OperatingProcedures (SOPs), manuals, Guidelines at all levels of theGovernment – Further, the National Disaster Management Authorityhad issued guidelines in the year 2008 itself which has been furtherdetailed in Plan-2019 – All aspects of the epidemics, all measuresto contain an epidemic, preparedness, response, mitigation havebeen elaborately dealt in Plan-2019 – The Disaster ManagementAct, 2005 contain ample powers and measures, which can be takenby the National Disaster Management Authority, National ExecutiveCommittee and Central Government to prepare further plans,guidelines and Standard Operating Procedure (SOPs), which inrespect to COVID-19 have done from time to time – ContainmentPlan for COVID-19 was also issued – There are no lack of guidelines,SOPs and Plan to contain COVID-19 — Nodal Ministry has broughton record updated containment plan for large outbreaks of COVID-19 – Guidelines and orders have been issued from time to time toregulate all measures to contain COVID-19 – Thus, there is no meritin the submission of the petitioner that there is no sufficient plan todeal with COVID-19 pandemic – National Plan, 2019 have beenthere in place supplemented by various orders and measures takenby competent authorities under Disaster Management Act, 2005,there is no occasion or need to issue any direction to Union ofIndia to prepare a fresh National Plan for COVID-19.Disaster Management Act, 2005 – s.12 – Guidelines forMinimum Standards of Relief – COVID-19 – Pandemic – A publicinterest litigation filed in wake of COVID-19 pandemic, seekingdirection to the Union of India to lay down minimum standards ofrelief u/s. 12 of the Act, 2005 to be provided to persons affectedwith COVID-19 – The petitioner pleaded that Centre should comeup with detailed guidelines recommending the minimum standardsof relief to be provided in the relief camps in relation to shelter,food, drinking water, medical cover and sanitation, in absence ofwhich, shelter homes and relief camps are susceptible of becominghotbeds for the spread of COVID-19 infection – It was furtherpleaded that the Centre should come up with detailed guidelinesunder s.12(ii) and (iii) of Act, 2005 for widows and orphans andex-gratia assistance to be provided to the kith and kin of thoselosing life because of COVID-19 infections but also as a result ofharsh lockdown restrictions – It was also submitted that there areno guidelines providing for minimum standards of relief for COVID-19 – Held: The respondent has brought on record the guidelineswhich were in existence before declaration of COVID-19 pandemicand it covers all statutory requirement as enumerated in s.12 – Theuniform guidelines are contemplated so that persons affected bydisaster are provided with minimum requirement in the relief campsin respect of shelter, food, drinking water, medical cover andsanitation and other reliefs as contemplated in the section – Therebeing already guidelines for minimum standards in place even beforeCOVID-19, the said guidelines for minimum standards holds goodeven for those who are affected by COVID-19 – Further, Governmentof India has treated COVID-19 as a notified disaster for the purposeof providing assistance under State Disaster Response Fund, normsof assistance for ex-gratia payment to families of deceased personsand other assistance – Therefore, Union of India is not obliged tolay down minimum standard of relief u/s.12 and guidelines issuedu/s.12 providing for minimum standards of relief holds good forpandemic COVID-19 also.Disaster Management Act, 2005 – s. 46 – National DisasterResponse Fund – COVID-19 – Pandemic – Public Interest Litigation– The submissions of the petitioner centre around National DisasterResponse Fund (NDRF) and PM CARES Fund – It was submittedthat the earlier guidelines for administration of NDRF which cameinto force with effect from financial year 2010-11 have beenmodified by new guidelines with effect from financial year2015-16, and now it is not possible for any person or institution tomake contribution to the NDRF and it was further submitted thatdeletion of paragraph 5.5 of earlier guidelines makes it clear thatit is not possible for any person or institution to make anycontribution to NDRF – It was contended that paragraph 5.5 of theearlier guidelines was deleted to benefit the PM CARES Fund –Held: New guidelines contain the same heading, i.e. ‘Contributionto the NDRF’ and guideline 5.2 provides ‘Funds will be creditedinto the NDRF in accordance with the provisions of the s. 46(1)(a)& (b) of the Disaster Management Act, 2005 – The above guideline5.2 specifically referred to s. 46(1)(a) & (b) and s. 46(1)(b) expresslyprovides that any grants that may be made by any person or institutionfor the purpose of disaster management shall be credited to NDRF– Thus, the submission that it is not possible for any person orinstitution to make any contribution to the NDRF is incorrect – So,any contribution, grant of any individual or institution is notprohibited to be credited into the NDRF and it is still open for anyperson or institution to make contribution to the NDRF in terms ofs. 46(1)(b) of the Act, 2005 – Further, the contribution by any personor by any institution in PM CARES Fund is voluntary and it is openfor any person or institution to make contribution to the PM CARESFund.Disaster Management Act, 2005 – s. 46 – COVID-19 –Pandemic – NDRF and PM

connectionwith FIR registered u/s. 306 and s.34 of the IPC – It was alleged thatthe appellant had not paid an amount due to the deceased for thework which was carried out by him, as a result of which he wasunder mental pressure and he committed suicide by hanging – In thesuicide note three individuals were held responsible including theappellant – The appellant invoked jurisdiction of the High Court u/Arts. 226/227 of the Constitution and s.482 of the Cr.P.C. and soughtquashing of FIR along with other reliefs – Pending the disposal ofthe petition, the appellant filed an application and sought his releasefrom the judicial custody – The High Court held that since theappellant was in judicial custody, it was open to him avail of theremedy of bail u/s. 439 of the Cr.P.C. – The High Court declinedprima facie to consider the submission of the appellant that theallegations in the FIR, read as they stand, do not disclose thecommission of an offence u/s. 306 of the IPC – The appellant filedan appeal before the Supreme Court aggrieved by the denial of hisinterim prayer for the grant of bail – On 11.11.2020, the SupremeCourt, after reserving the judgment, ordered and directed the releaseof all the three individuals including appellant on bail pending thedisposal of the proceedings before the High Court – Held: Accordingto the spouse of the deceased, her husband was over the previoustwo years ‘having pressure as he did not receive the money of workcarried out by him’ – The deceased left behind a suicide note statingthat his “money is stuck and following owners of respective companiesare not paying our legitimate dues” – The consistent line of authorityof Supreme Court lays down that in order to bring a case within thepurview of s.306 IPC, there must be a case of suicide and in thecommission of the said offence, the person who is said to haveabetted the commission of suicide must have played an active roleby an act of instigation or by doing certain act to facilitate thecommission of suicide – Therefore, the act of abetment by the personcharged with the said offence must be proved and established bythe prosecution – In the instant case, prima facie, on the applicationof test laid down by the Supreme Court it cannot be said that theappellant was guilty of having abetted suicide within the meaningof s.306 of the IPC – The High Court in failing to notice the contentsof FIR and to make a prima facie evaluation abdicated its role,functions and jurisdiction when seized of petition u/s. 482 of Cr.P.C.–As a consequence of its failure to perform its function u/s. 482 Cr.P.C.,the High Court disabled itself from exercising its jurisdiction u/Art.226to consider appellant’s application for bail – While consideringapplication u/Art. 226, the High Court must be circumspect inexercising its power on the basis of the facts of each case – However,the High court should not foreclose itself from the exercise of thepower when a citizen has been arbitrarily deprived of their personalliberty in an excess of state power – Therefore, the interim protectiongranted to the accused on 11.11.2020 continue to remain in operationpending the disposal of the proceedings before the High Court.Constitution of India – Art.226 – Power to grant interim bail– The appellant was arrested in connection with FIR registered u/s.306 and s.34 of the IPC – Appellant filed petition u/Art.226/227 ofthe Constitution and u/s.482 of the Cr.P.C. for quashing the FIRand the arrest memo – Thereafter, the appellant filed application forinterim bail – The High Court declined to evaluate prima facie at theinterim stage in a petition for quashing the FIR as to whether anarguable case has been made out – The High Court further declinedto allow the appellant’s prayer for interim bail and relegated him tothe remedy u/s.439 of Cr.P.C. – Aggrieved, the appellant filed anappeal before the Supreme Court – It was submitted by therespondents that procedural hierarchy of Courts in mattersconcerning the grant of bail needs to be respected – Held: Therespondents are right in submitting that the procedural hierarchy ofcourts in matters concerning the grant of bail needs to be respected– However, there was a failure of the High Court to discharge itsadjudicatory function at two levels – first in declining to evaluateprima facie at the interim stage in a petition for quashing the FIR asto whether an arguable case has been made out, and secondly, indeclining interim bail, as a consequence of its failure to render aprima facie opinion on the first – The High Court did have the powerto protect the citizen by an interim order in a petition invoking Art.226 – Where the High Court has failed to do so, Supreme Courtwould be abdicating its role and functions as a constitutional courtif it refuses to interfere, despite the parameters for such interferencebeing met.Words and Phrases – “Human Liberty and the role of the Courts” –discussed.",

Court declinedprima facie to consider the submission of the appellant that theallegations in the FIR, read as they stand, do not disclose thecommission of an offence u/s. 306 of the IPC – The appellant filedan appeal before the Supreme Court aggrieved by the denial of hisinterim prayer for the grant of bail – On 11.11.2020, the SupremeCourt, after reserving the judgment, ordered and directed the releaseof all the three individuals including appellant on bail pending thedisposal of the proceedings before the High Court – Held: Accordingto the spouse of the deceased, her husband was over the previoustwo years ‘having pressure as he did not receive the money of workcarried out by him’ – The deceased left behind a suicide note statingthat his “money is stuck and following owners of respective companiesare not paying our legitimate dues” – The consistent line of authorityof Supreme Court lays down that in order to bring a case within thepurview of s.306 IPC, there must be a case of suicide and in thecommission of the said offence, the person who is said to haveabetted the commission of suicide must have played an active roleby an act of instigation or by doing certain act to facilitate thecommission of suicide – Therefore, the act of abetment by the personcharged with the said offence must be proved and established bythe prosecution – In the instant case, prima facie, on the applicationof test laid down by the Supreme Court it cannot be said that theappellant was guilty of having abetted suicide within the meaningof s.306 of the IPC – The High Court in failing to notice the contentsof FIR and to make a prima facie evaluation abdicated its role,functions and jurisdiction when seized of petition u/s. 482 of Cr.P.C.–As a consequence of its failure to perform its function u/s. 482 Cr.P.C.,the High Court disabled itself from exercising its jurisdiction u/Art.226to consider appellant’s application for bail – While consideringapplication u/Art. 226, the High Court must be circumspect inexercising its power on the basis of the facts of each case – However,the High court should not foreclose itself from the exercise of thepower when a citizen has been arbitrarily deprived of their personalliberty in an excess of state power – Therefore, the interim protectiongranted to the accused on 11.11.2020 continue to remain in operationpending the disposal of the proceedings before the High Court.Constitution of India – Art.226 – Power to grant interim bail– The appellant was arrested in connection with FIR registered u/s.306 and s.34 of the IPC – Appellant filed petition u/Art.226/227 ofthe Constitution and u/s.482 of the Cr.P.C. for quashing the FIRand the arrest memo – Thereafter, the appellant filed application forinterim bail – The High Court declined to evaluate prima facie at theinterim stage in a petition for quashing the FIR as to whether anarguable case has been made out – The High Court further declinedto allow the appellant’s prayer for interim bail and relegated him tothe remedy u/s.439 of Cr.P.C. – Aggrieved, the appellant filed anappeal before the Supreme Court – It was submitted by therespondents that procedural hierarchy of Courts in mattersconcerning the grant of bail needs to be respected – Held: Therespondents are right in submitting that the procedural hierarchy ofcourts in matters concerning the grant of bail needs to be respected– However, there was a failure of the High Court to discharge itsadjudicatory function at two levels – first in declining to evaluateprima facie at the interim stage in a petition for quashing the FIR asto whether an arguable case has been made out, and secondly, indeclining interim bail, as a consequence of its failure to render aprima facie opinion on the first – The High Court did have the powerto protect the citizen by an interim order in a petition invoking Art.226 – Where the High Court has failed to do so, Supreme Courtwould be abdicating its role and functions as a constitutional courtif it refuses to interfere, despite the parameters for such interferencebeing met.Words and Phrases – “Human Liberty and the role of the Courts” –discussed.",

connectionwith FIR registered u/s. 306 and s.34 of the IPC – It was alleged thatthe appellant had not paid an amount due to the deceased for thework which was carried out by him, as a result of which he wasunder mental pressure and he committed suicide by hanging – In thesuicide note three individuals were held responsible including theappellant – The appellant invoked jurisdiction of the High Court u/Arts. 226/227 of the Constitution and s.482 of the Cr.P.C. and soughtquashing of FIR along with other reliefs – Pending the disposal ofthe petition, the appellant filed an application and sought his releasefrom the judicial custody – The High Court held that since theappellant was in judicial custody, it was open to him avail of theremedy of bail u/s. 439 of the Cr.P.C. – The High Court declinedprima facie to consider the submission of the appellant that theallegations in the FIR, read as they stand, do not disclose thecommission of an offence u/s. 306 of the IPC – The appellant filedan appeal before the Supreme Court aggrieved by the denial of hisinterim prayer for the grant of bail – On 11.11.2020, the SupremeCourt, after reserving the judgment, ordered and directed the releaseof all the three individuals including appellant on bail pending thedisposal of the proceedings before the High Court – Held: Accordingto the spouse of the deceased, her husband was over the previoustwo years ‘having pressure as he did not receive the money of workcarried out by him’ – The deceased left behind a suicide note statingthat his “money is stuck and following owners of respective companiesare not paying our legitimate dues” – The consistent line of authorityof Supreme Court lays down that in order to bring a case within thepurview of s.306 IPC, there must be a case of suicide and in thecommission of the said offence, the person who is said to haveabetted the commission of suicide must have played an active roleby an act of instigation or by doing certain act to facilitate thecommission of suicide – Therefore, the act of abetment by the personcharged with the said offence must be proved and established bythe prosecution – In the instant case, prima facie, on the applicationof test laid down by the Supreme Court it cannot be said that theappellant was guilty of having abetted suicide within the meaningof s.306 of the IPC – The High Court in failing to notice the contentsof FIR and to make a prima facie evaluation abdicated its role,functions and jurisdiction when seized of petition u/s. 482 of Cr.P.C.–As a consequence of its failure to perform its function u/s. 482 Cr.P.C.,the High Court disabled itself from exercising its jurisdiction u/Art.226to consider appellant’s application for bail – While consideringapplication u/Art. 226, the High Court must be circumspect inexercising its power on the basis of the facts of each case – However,the High court should not foreclose itself from the exercise of thepower when a citizen has been arbitrarily deprived of their personalliberty in an excess of state power – Therefore, the interim protectiongranted to the accused on 11.11.2020 continue to remain in operationpending the disposal of the proceedings before the High Court.Constitution of India – Art.226 – Power to grant interim bail– The appellant was arrested in connection with FIR registered u/s.306 and s.34 of the IPC – Appellant filed petition u/Art.226/227 ofthe Constitution and u/s.482 of the Cr.P.C. for quashing the FIRand the arrest memo – Thereafter, the appellant filed application forinterim bail – The High Court declined to evaluate prima facie at theinterim stage in a petition for quashing the FIR as to whether anarguable case has been made out – The High Court further declinedto allow the appellant’s prayer for interim bail and relegated him tothe remedy u/s.439 of Cr.P.C. – Aggrieved, the appellant filed anappeal before the Supreme Court – It was submitted by therespondents that procedural hierarchy of Courts in mattersconcerning the grant of bail needs to be respected – Held: Therespondents are right in submitting that the procedural hierarchy ofcourts in matters concerning the grant of bail needs to be respected– However, there was a failure of the High Court to discharge itsadjudicatory function at two levels – first in declining to evaluateprima facie at the interim stage in a petition for quashing the FIR asto whether an arguable case has been made out, and secondly, indeclining interim bail, as a consequence of its failure to render aprima facie opinion on the first – The High Court did have the powerto protect the citizen by an interim order in a petition invoking Art.226 – Where the High Court has failed to do so, Supreme Courtwould be abdicating its role and functions as a constitutional courtif it refuses to interfere, despite the parameters for such interferencebeing met.Words and Phrases – “Human Liberty and the role of the Courts” –discussed.",

connectionwith FIR registered u/s. 306 and s.34 of the IPC – It was alleged thatthe appellant had not paid an amount due to the deceased for thework which was carried out by him, as a result of which he wasunder mental pressure and he committed suicide by hanging – In thesuicide note three individuals were held responsible including theappellant – The appellant invoked jurisdiction of the High Court u/Arts. 226/227 of the Constitution and s.482 of the Cr.P.C. and soughtquashing of FIR along with other reliefs – Pending the disposal ofthe petition, the appellant filed an application and sought his releasefrom the judicial custody – The High Court held that since theappellant was in judicial custody, it was open to him avail of theremedy of bail u/s. 439 of the Cr.P.C. – The High Court declinedprima facie to consider the submission of the appellant that theallegations in the FIR, read as they stand, do not disclose thecommission of an offence u/s. 306 of the IPC – The appellant filedan appeal before the Supreme Court aggrieved by the denial of hisinterim prayer for the grant of bail – On 11.11.2020, the SupremeCourt, after reserving the judgment, ordered and directed the releaseof all the three individuals including appellant on bail pending thedisposal of the proceedings before the High Court – Held: Accordingto the spouse of the deceased, her husband was over the previoustwo years ‘having pressure as he did not receive the money of workcarried out by him’ – The deceased left behind a suicide note statingthat his “money is stuck and following owners of respective companiesare not paying our legitimate dues” – The consistent line of authorityof Supreme Court lays down that in order to bring a case within thepurview of s.306 IPC, there must be a case of suicide and in thecommission of the said offence, the person who is said to haveabetted the commission of suicide must have played an active roleby an act of instigation or by doing certain act to facilitate thecommission of suicide – Therefore, the act of abetment by the personcharged with the said offence must be proved and established bythe prosecution – In the instant case, prima facie, on the applicationof test laid down by the Supreme Court it cannot be said that theappellant was guilty of having abetted suicide within the meaningof s.306 of the IPC – The High Court in failing to notice the contentsof FIR and to make a prima facie evaluation abdicated its role,functions and jurisdiction when seized of petition u/s. 482 of Cr.P.C.–As a consequence of its failure to perform its function u/s. 482 Cr.P.C.,the High Court disabled itself from exercising its jurisdiction u/Art.226to consider appellant’s application for bail – While consideringapplication u/Art. 226, the High Court must be circumspect inexercising its power on the basis of the facts of each case – However,the High court should not foreclose itself from the exercise of thepower when a citizen has been arbitrarily deprived of their personalliberty in an excess of state power – Therefore, the interim protectiongranted to the accused on 11.11.2020 continue to remain in operationpending the disposal of the proceedings before the High Court.Constitution of India – Art.226 – Power to grant interim bail– The appellant was arrested in connection with FIR registered u/s.306 and s.34 of the IPC – Appellant filed petition u/Art.226/227 ofthe Constitution and u/s.482 of the Cr.P.C. for quashing the FIRand the arrest memo – Thereafter, the appellant filed application forinterim bail – The High Court declined to evaluate prima facie at theinterim stage in a petition for quashing the FIR as to whether anarguable case has been made out – The High Court further declinedto allow the appellant’s prayer for interim bail and relegated him tothe remedy u/s.439 of Cr.P.C. – Aggrieved, the appellant filed anappeal before the Supreme Court – It was submitted by therespondents that procedural hierarchy of Courts in mattersconcerning the grant of bail needs to be respected – Held: Therespondents are right in submitting that the procedural hierarchy ofcourts in matters concerning the grant of bail needs to be respected– However, there was a failure of the High Court to discharge itsadjudicatory function at two levels – first in declining to evaluateprima facie at the interim stage in a petition for quashing the FIR asto whether an arguable case has been made out, and secondly, indeclining interim bail, as a consequence of its failure to render aprima facie opinion on the first – The High Court did have the powerto protect the citizen by an interim order in a petition invoking Art.226 – Where the High Court has failed to do so, Supreme Courtwould be abdicating its role and functions as a constitutional courtif it refuses to interfere, despite the parameters for such interferencebeing met.Words and Phrases – “Human Liberty and the role of the Courts” –discussed.",

connectionwith FIR registered u/s. 306 and s.34 of the IPC – It was alleged thatthe appellant had not paid an amount due to the deceased for thework which was carried out by him, as a result of which he wasunder mental pressure and he committed suicide by hanging – In thesuicide note three individuals were held responsible including theappellant – The appellant invoked jurisdiction of the High Court u/Arts. 226/227 of the Constitution and s.482 of the Cr.P.C. and soughtquashing of FIR along with other reliefs – Pending the disposal ofthe petition, the appellant filed an application and sought his releasefrom the judicial custody – The High Court held that since theappellant was in judicial custody, it was open to him avail of theremedy of bail u/s. 439 of the Cr.P.C. – The High Court declinedprima facie to consider the submission of the appellant that theallegations in the FIR, read as they stand, do not disclose thecommission of an offence u/s. 306 of the IPC – The appellant filedan appeal before the Supreme Court aggrieved by the denial of hisinterim prayer for the grant of bail – On 11.11.2020, the SupremeCourt, after reserving the judgment, ordered and directed the releaseof all the three individuals including appellant on bail pending thedisposal of the proceedings before the High Court – Held: Accordingto the spouse of the deceased, her husband was over the previoustwo years ‘having pressure as he did not receive the money of workcarried out by him’ – The deceased left behind a suicide note statingthat his “money is stuck and following owners of respective companiesare not paying our legitimate dues” – The consistent line of authorityof Supreme Court lays down that in order to bring a case within thepurview of s.306 IPC, there must be a case of suicide and in thecommission of the said offence, the person who is said to haveabetted the commission of suicide must have played an active roleby an act of instigation or by doing certain act to facilitate thecommission of suicide – Therefore, the act of abetment by the personcharged with the said offence must be proved and established bythe prosecution – In the instant case, prima facie, on the applicationof test laid down by the Supreme Court it cannot be said that theappellant was guilty of having abetted suicide within the meaningof s.306 of the IPC – The High Court in failing to notice the contentsof FIR and to make a prima facie evaluation abdicated its role,functions and jurisdiction when seized of petition u/s. 482 of Cr.P.C.–As a consequence of its failure to perform its function u/s. 482 Cr.P.C.,the High Court disabled itself from exercising its jurisdiction u/Art.226to consider appellant’s application for bail – While consideringapplication u/Art. 226, the High Court must be circumspect inexercising its power on the basis of the facts of each case – However,the High court should not foreclose itself from the exercise of thepower when a citizen has been arbitrarily deprived of their personalliberty in an excess of state power – Therefore, the interim protectiongranted to the accused on 11.11.2020 continue to remain in operationpending the disposal of the proceedings before the High Court.Constitution of India – Art.226 – Power to grant interim bail– The appellant was arrested in connection with FIR registered u/s.306 and s.34 of the IPC – Appellant filed petition u/Art.226/227 ofthe Constitution and u/s.482 of the Cr.P.C. for quashing the FIRand the arrest memo – Thereafter, the appellant filed application forinterim bail – The High Court declined to evaluate prima facie at theinterim stage in a petition for quashing the FIR as to whether anarguable case has been made out – The High Court further declinedto allow the appellant’s prayer for interim bail and relegated him tothe remedy u/s.439 of Cr.P.C. – Aggrieved, the appellant filed anappeal before the Supreme Court – It was submitted by therespondents that procedural hierarchy of Courts in mattersconcerning the grant of bail needs to be respected – Held: Therespondents are right in submitting that the procedural hierarchy ofcourts in matters concerning the grant of bail needs to be respected– However, there was a failure of the High Court to discharge itsadjudicatory function at two levels – first in declining to evaluateprima facie at the interim stage in a petition for quashing the FIR asto whether an arguable case has been made out, and secondly, indeclining interim bail, as a consequence of its failure to render aprima facie opinion on the first – The High Court did have the powerto protect the citizen by an interim order in a petition invoking Art.226 – Where the High Court has failed to do so, Supreme Courtwould be abdicating its role and functions as a constitutional courtif it refuses to interfere, despite the parameters for such interferencebeing met.Words and Phrases – “Human Liberty and the role of the Courts” –discussed.",

connectionwith FIR registered u/s. 306 and s.34 of the IPC – It was alleged thatthe appellant had not paid an amount due to the deceased for thework which was carried out by him, as a result of which he wasunder mental pressure and he committed suicide by hanging – In thesuicide note three individuals were held responsible including theappellant – The appellant invoked jurisdiction of the High Court u/Arts. 226/227 of the Constitution and s.482 of the Cr.P.C. and soughtquashing of FIR along with other reliefs – Pending the disposal ofthe petition, the appellant filed an application and sought his releasefrom the judicial custody – The High Court held that since theappellant was in judicial custody, it was open to him avail of theremedy of bail u/s. 439 of the Cr.P.C. – The High Court declinedprima facie to consider the submission of the appellant that theallegations in the FIR, read as they stand, do not disclose thecommission of an offence u/s. 306 of the IPC – The appellant filedan appeal before the Supreme Court aggrieved by the denial of hisinterim prayer for the grant of bail – On 11.11.2020, the SupremeCourt, after reserving the judgment, ordered and directed the releaseof all the three individuals including appellant on bail pending thedisposal of the proceedings before the High Court – Held: Accordingto the spouse of the deceased, her husband was over the previoustwo years ‘having pressure as he did not receive the money of workcarried out by him’ – The deceased left behind a suicide note statingthat his “money is stuck and following owners of respective companiesare not paying our legitimate dues” – The consistent line of authorityof Supreme Court lays down that in order to bring a case within thepurview of s.306 IPC, there must be a case of suicide and in thecommission of the said offence, the person who is said to haveabetted the commission of suicide must have played an active roleby an act of instigation or by doing certain act to facilitate thecommission of suicide – Therefore, the act of abetment by the personcharged with the said offence must be proved and established bythe prosecution – In the instant case, prima facie, on the applicationof test laid down by the Supreme Court it cannot be said that theappellant was guilty of having abetted suicide within the meaningof s.306 of the IPC – The High Court in failing to notice the contentsof FIR and to make a prima facie evaluation abdicated its role,functions and jurisdiction when seized of petition u/s. 482 of Cr.P.C.–As a consequence of its failure to perform its function u/s. 482 Cr.P.C.,the High Court disabled itself from exercising its jurisdiction u/Art.226to consider appellant’s application for bail – While consideringapplication u/Art. 226, the High Court must be circumspect inexercising its power on the basis of the facts of each case – However,the High court should not foreclose itself from the exercise of thepower when a citizen has been arbitrarily deprived of their personalliberty in an excess of state power – Therefore, the interim protectiongranted to the accused on 11.11.2020 continue to remain in operationpending the disposal of the proceedings before the High Court.Constitution of India – Art.226 – Power to grant interim bail– The appellant was arrested in connection with FIR registered u/s.306 and s.34 of the IPC – Appellant filed petition u/Art.226/227 ofthe Constitution and u/s.482 of the Cr.P.C. for quashing the FIRand the arrest memo – Thereafter, the appellant filed application forinterim bail – The High Court declined to evaluate prima facie at theinterim stage in a petition for quashing the FIR as to whether anarguable case has been made out – The High Court further declinedto allow the appellant’s prayer for interim bail and relegated him tothe remedy u/s.439 of Cr.P.C. – Aggrieved, the appellant filed anappeal before the Supreme Court – It was submitted by therespondents that procedural hierarchy of Courts in mattersconcerning the grant of bail needs to be respected – Held: Therespondents are right in submitting that the procedural hierarchy ofcourts in matters concerning the grant of bail needs to be respected– However, there was a failure of the High Court to discharge itsadjudicatory function at two levels – first in declining to evaluateprima facie at the interim stage in a petition for quashing the FIR asto whether an arguable case has been made out, and secondly, indeclining interim bail, as a consequence of its failure to render aprima facie opinion on the first – The High Court did have the powerto protect the citizen by an interim order in a petition invoking Art.226 – Where the High Court has failed to do so, Supreme Courtwould be abdicating its role and functions as a constitutional courtif it refuses to interfere, despite the parameters for such interferencebeing met.Words and Phrases – “Human Liberty and the role of the Courts” –discussed.",
