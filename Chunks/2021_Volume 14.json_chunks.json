        "HeadNote": "Andhra Pradesh (Telangana Area) Tenancy and Agricultural Lands Act, 1950 – ss.19, 38-E – Andhra Pradesh (Telangana Area) Abolition of Inams Act, 1955 – Protected tenant – Oral surrender of the tenancy rights, if permissible – High Court set aside the order dtd.19.2.82 passed by Revenue Divisional Officer granting occupancy rights to predecessor-in-interest of the appellants- purchaser as well as the order passed by Joint Collector dismissing the appeal filed by the protected tenant – Occupancy rights granted to the purchaser stood annulled – On appeal, held: Surrender of oral tenancy of a protected tenant is not permissible under the Tenancy Act except in the manner prescribed u/s.38-E (5) r/w s.19, Tenancy Act – In the present case, the oral surrender by the protected tenant is set up in the year 1954 followed by sale of tenancy rights in 1957 – Thereafter, the petition u/s.19, Tenancy Act was filed to seek approval of the Tenancy rights, but was withdrawn on the basis of an order withdrawing the appeal against the grant of occupancy rights – Thus, the purchasers took steps to procure surrender of tenancy rights, realizing that such surrender cannot be oral or by executing a sale deed – It was a cover up operation initiated by the purchaser – Since, neither the oral surrender nor surrender in writing was recorded as bonafide by the Tehsildar, the subsequent surrender approved by Mandal Revenue Officer is a nullity as such surrender is in contravention of the statutory provisions – Protected tenant was conferred ownership rights u/s.38-E, Tenancy Act on 23.3.75 whereas the conferment of occupancy rights were granted in the year 1982 under the Inams Act – On grant of certificate of ownership u/s.38-E, the protected tenants shall be deemed to be the full owners of such land – Once the protected tenants are deemed to be owners, there could not be any occupancy rights certificate as the purchasers were divested of their ownership by virtue of the grant of ownership certificate u/s.38-E, Tenancy Act – Appeals allegedly filed by the protected tenant against the grant of occupancy rights certificate and subsequently being withdrawn is wholly inconsequential – Title of the protected tenants is complete and the ownership vests with them – Entitled to restoration of possession. Andhra Pradesh (Telangana Area) Tenancy and Agricultural Lands Act, 1950 – ss.19, 32, 38-E – Held: Neither s.19 nor s.32 forming part of Chapter III of the Tenancy Act are applicable in respect of protected tenant except when the reference is made to the provisions of s.19 on the basis of s.38-E(5) which starts with a non obstante clause giving overriding effect to anything contained in s.38-E. Andhra Pradesh (Telangana Area) Abolition of Inams Act, 1955 – Andhra Pradesh (Telangana Area) Tenancy and Agricultural Lands Act, 1950 – Operation of the Acts – Held: Both the Inams Act and the Tenancy Act are enacted by the same Legislature – The Inams Act is a later Act enacted in 1955 but s.38-E (1) was substituted in 1971 which starts with a non- obstante clause– Therefore, ownership certificate granted under the Tenancy Act would prevail over the grant of occupancy rights certificate under the Inams Act – Both the Acts operate in different spheres.",

Judgment/Order: Reasoned order – Duty of Appellate court while affirming, modifying or reversing the judgment of lower court – Held: The Appellate Court has jurisdiction to reverse, affirm or modify the findings and the judgment of the Trial Court – However, while reversing or modifying the judgment of a Trial Court, it is the duty of the Appellate Court to reflect in its judgment, conscious application of mind on the findings recorded supported by reasons, on all issues dealt with, as well as the contentions put forth, and pressed by the parties for decision of the Appellate Court – No doubt, when the Appellate Court affirms the judgment of a Trial Court, the reasoning need not to be elaborate although re- appreciation of the evidence and reconsideration of the judgment of the Trial Court are necessary concomitants – But while reversing a judgment of a Trial Court, the Appellate Court must be more conscious of its duty in assigning the reasons for doing so – In the instant case, High Court has dealt with the judgment of the Trial Judge in a short cut method, bereft of all reasoning while reversing the judgment of the Trial Court both on facts as well as law. Judgment/Order: Duty of Appellate court, while reversing the judgment of lower court – Held: While writing a judgment of reversal, an Appellate Court must remain conscious of two principles – Firstly, the findings of facts based on conflicting evidence arrivedat by the Trial Court must weigh with the Appellate Court, more so when the findings are based on oral evidence recorded by the same Presiding Judge who authors the judgment – If, on an appraisal of the evidence, it is found that the judgment of the Trial Court suffers from a material irregularity or is based on inadmissible evidence or on conjectures and surmises, the Appellate Court is entitled to interfere with the finding of fact but by assigning cogent reasons for doing so – Otherwise, the findings of the Trial Court should not be interfered with lightly on a question of fact – Secondly, while reversing a finding of fact, it is necessary that the Appellate Court assigns its own reasons for doing so – This is especially so in case there are further appeals under s.100, CPC, as the first Appellate Court is the final court of facts and the said findings are immune from challenge in a second appeal. Appeal: Right to file appeal – Held: Right to appeal is a creature of statute – The right to file an appeal by an unsuccessful party assailing the judgment of the Original Court is a valuable right and hence a duty is cast on the Appellate Court to adjudicate a first appeal both on questions of fact and applicable law – Hence, the re-appreciation of evidence in light of the contentions raised by the respective parties and judicial precedent and the law applicable to the case have to be conscientiously dealt with.",

Appeal: Right to file appeal – Held: Right to appeal is a creature of statute – The right to file an appeal by an unsuccessful party assailing the judgment of the Original Court is a valuable right and hence a duty is cast on the Appellate Court to adjudicate a first appeal both on questions of fact and applicable law – Hence, the re-appreciation of evidence in light of the contentions raised by the respective parties and judicial precedent and the law applicable to the case have to be conscientiously dealt with.",

        "HeadNote": "Will: Suspicious circumstances in execution of will – Bequest made in the name of testator’s son to the exclusion of testator’s daughters – Testator’s son lived for eleven years after the death of their father – Petition seeking Letters of Administration filed fifteen years after the death of the testator by wife of testator’s son – Daughters of testator defendants sought for dismissal of the petition on the ground that the will was fabricated – Held: It is highly improbable that the only son of the testator who was a practicing advocate and on whom the bequest of the house was made, was unaware of the execution of the will by his father – It is unnatural that the father would not have disclosed to his only son about the bequest of the property and had also not taken his son’s assistance in the drafting as well as execution of the will – The testator had suffered a paralytic stroke which had affected his speech, mobility of his right arm and right leg and he was bedridden for a period of ten months prior to his death – Taking these circumstances into consideration, a doubt is created as to whether the testator was in a sound and disposing state of mind at the time of making of the testament which was fifteen days prior to his death – The said suspicion in the mind of the Court has not been removed by the propounder of the will i.e. first plaintiff by producing any contra medical evidence or the evidence of the doctor who was treating the testator prior to his death – Testator had himself stated in the alleged will that he was sick and getting weak even then he is stated to have “written” the will himself which is not believable – s.63 of the Succession Act, 1925 categorically states that the testator has to sign on the will and the signature of the testator must be such that it would “intend” thereby to give effect to the writing of a will – Hence, the genuineness of the will must be proved by proving the intention of the testator to make the testament and for that, all steps which are required to be taken for making a valid testament must be proved by placing concrete evidence before the Court – There is no evidence as to whom the testator gave instructions to write the will – The scribe was also not examined – In order to prove the execution of the document such as a testament, at least one of the attesting witnesses who had attested the same must be called to give evidence for the purpose of proof of its execution – One attestor had died – The second attestor, PW2 had given his evidence – PW2 deposed that the will could not be registered as the testator was unwell and in fact, he was bedridden – His deposition was rather fatal to the case of the beneficiary of the Will – Trial Court had also not believed the evidence of PW2 – Respondents-plaintiffs were not successful in proving the validity of the will in accordance with law inasmuch as the suspicious circumstances surrounding the very execution of the will were not cleared by any cogent evidence, rather, the genuineness of will remained in doubt – The alleged Will not being a valid document in the eye of law, no Letters of Administration can be granted to the respondents-plaintiffs – Succession Act, 1925 – s.63. Judgment/Order: Reasoned order – Duty of Appellate court while affirming, modifying or reversing the judgment of lower court – Held: The Appellate Court has jurisdiction to reverse, affirm or modify the findings and the judgment of the Trial Court – However, while reversing or modifying the judgment of a Trial Court, it is the duty of the Appellate Court to reflect in its judgment, conscious application of mind on the findings recorded supported by reasons, on all issues dealt with, as well as the contentions put forth, and pressed by the parties for decision of the Appellate Court – No doubt, when the Appellate Court affirms the judgment of a Trial Court, the reasoning need not to be elaborate although re- appreciation of the evidence and reconsideration of the judgment of the Trial Court are necessary concomitants – But while reversing a judgment of a Trial Court, the Appellate Court must be more conscious of its duty in assigning the reasons for doing so – In the instant case, High Court has dealt with the judgment of the Trial Judge in a short cut method, bereft of all reasoning while reversing the judgment of the Trial Court both on facts as well as law. Judgment/Order: Duty of Appellate court, while reversing the judgment of lower court – Held: While writing a judgment of reversal, an Appellate Court must remain conscious of two principles – Firstly, the findings of facts based on conflicting evidence arrivedat by the Trial Court must weigh with the Appellate Court, more so when the findings are based on oral evidence recorded by the same Presiding Judge who authors the judgment – If, on an appraisal of the evidence, it is found that the judgment of the Trial Court suffers from a material irregularity or is based on inadmissible evidence or on conjectures and surmises, the Appellate Court is entitled to interfere with the finding of fact but by assigning cogent reasons for doing so – Otherwise, the findings of the Trial Court should not be interfered with lightly on a question of fact – Secondly, while reversing a finding of fact, it is necessary that the Appellate Court assigns its own reasons for doing so – This is especially so in case there are further appeals under s.100, CPC, as the first Appellate Court is the final court of facts and the said findings are immune from challenge in a second appeal.

        "HeadNote": " Securities and Exchange Board of India (Mutual Funds) Regulations, 1996 – Regulation 18(15)(c), 39(2)(a) – Winding up of Mutual Fund Schemes – Consent of unitholders – Held: For the purpose of clause (c) to Regulation 18(15), consent of the unitholders would mean consent by majority of the unitholders who have participated in the poll, and not consent of majority of all the unitholders of the scheme – In the present case, the objections to poll results rejected – Unitholders of the six schemes have given their consent by majority to wind up the six schemes – With the consent of the parties, M/s. SBI Funds Management Private Limited appointed to undertake the exercise of winding up, which would include liquidation of the holdings/assets/portfolio and distribution/ payment to the unitholders – Winding up and disbursements to be in terms of the directions in earlier orders dtd. 2nd February, 2021 and 9th February, 2021 and paragraph 41 herein – Other aspects and issues including the questions whether Regulation 18(15)(c) would apply when the trustee’s form an opinion that the scheme should be wound up in accordance with Regulation 39(2)(a) and the contention of the objecting unitholders regarding misfeasance, malfeasances, fraud and the effect thereof, not examined. Securities and Exchange Board of India (Mutual Funds) Regulations, 1996 – Regulation 18(15) (c) – Mutual Fund Schemes – Winding up of – Consent of unitholders – Plea of the objecting unitholders that consent would be binding only on those who have consented to winding up of the mutual fund schemes and cannot be imposed on others – Held: Rejected – ‘consent’, in the context of the clause, clearly refers to ‘consent of the majority of the unitholders’, and not consent given by individual unitholders who alone would be bound by their consent, that is, it excludes unitholders who are not agreeable. Interpretation of Statutes – Principles of interpretation – Held: When there is choice between two interpretations, the Court would avoid a ‘construction’ which would reduce the legislation to futility, and should rather accept the ‘construction’ based on the view that draftsmen would legislate only for the purpose of bringing about an effective result. Securities and Exchange Board of India (Mutual Funds) Regulations, 1996 – Regulation 18(15) (c) – Winding up of Mutual Fund Schemes – Consent of unitholders – Held: Regulation 18(15)(c) mandates and requires consent of the unitholders for winding up, but does not prescribe any mode or manner for taking consent – Therefore, by implication, the Regulation gives option of holding a physical meeting, postal poll or e-poll. Words & Phrases – “consent” – Securities and Exchange Board of India (Mutual Funds) Regulations, 1996 – Regulation 18(15) (c) – Held: ‘consent’ in sub-regulation (15) to Regulation 18 refers to affirmative consent to winding up by ‘the majority of the unitholders’– Conversely, consent is denied when ‘majority of the unitholders’ do not approve the proposal to wind up the scheme.

Constitution of India – Seventh Schedule, List II, Entries 1, 2 & 18 – Committee on Peace and Harmony constituted by Delhi Legislative Assembly in the wake of Delhi riots – Validity of – Held: The Assembly is no different from any other State assembly, except to the extent that certain powers in List II of the Seventh Schedule have not been conferred (i.e., Entries 1, 2 & 18) – Assembly admittedly does not have any power to legislate on aspects of law and order and police in view of Entries 1 and 2 of List II in the Seventh Schedule inter alia being excluded – Assembly does not only perform the function of legislating; there are many other aspects of governance which can form part of the essential functions of the Legislative Assembly and consequently the Committee – Committee can trace its legitimacy to several Entries in List II and List III without encroaching upon the excluded fields of public order or police to undertake a concerted effort albeit not to the extent as canvassed – In the larger context, the concept of peace and harmony goes much beyond law and order and police, more so in view of on the-ground governance being in the hands of the Delhi Government.

        "HeadNote": "Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (Amendment) Act, 2020 – s.3 –s.3 of the impugned amendment, amended s.7(1) of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016, incorporating three provisos to s.7(1) – Under the second proviso, a new threshold was declared for an allottee to move an application u/s.7 for trigerring the insolvency resolution process under the Code – The second proviso provided that for financial creditors who were allottees under a real estate project, an application for initiating corporate insolvency resolution process against the corporate debtor was to be filed jointly by not less than one hundred of such allottees under the same real estate project or not less than ten per cent of the total number of such allottees under the same real estate project, whichever is less – Challenge to the second proviso to s.7(1) – Held: Not tenable – The object of the Statute, admittedly, is to ensure that there is a critical mass of persons (allottees), who agree that the time is ripe to invoke the Code and to submit to the inexorable processes under the Code, with all its attendant perils – The rationale behind, confining allottees to the same real estate project, is to promote the object of the Code – Once the threshold requirement can pass muster when tested in the anvil of a challenge based on Arts. 14, 19 and 21, then, there is both logic and reason behind the legislative value judgment that the allottees, who must join the application under the impugned provisos, must be related to the same real estate project – Allottees under real estate projects are financial creditors, but they possess certain characteristics, which set them apart from generality of the financial creditors, such as numerosity; heterogeneity; and individuality in decision making – If a single allottee, as a financial creditor, is allowed to move an application u/s.7, the interests of all the other allottees may be put in peril – In the circumstances, if the Legislature, taking into consideration, the sheer numbers of a group of creditors, viz., the allottees of real estate projects, finds this to be an intelligible differentia, which distinguishes the allottees from the other financial creditors, who are not found to possess the characteristics of numerosity, then, it is not for this Court to sit in judgment over the wisdom of such a measure – The allottee continues to be a financial creditor – All that is envisaged is the legislative value judgment that a critical mass is indispensable for allottees to be present before the Code, can be activised – The purport of the critical mass of applicants would ensure that a reasonable number of persons similarly circumstanced, form the view that despite the remedies available under the RERA or the Consumer Protection Act or a civil suit, the invoking of the Code is the only way out, in a particular case – If the Legislature felt that having regard to the consequences of an application under the Code, when such a large group of persons, pull at each other, an additional threshold be erected for exercising the right u/s.7, certainly, it cannot suffer a constitutional veto at the hands of Court exercising judicial review of legislation – This is not a case where the right of the allottee is completely taken away – All that has happened is a half-way house is built between extreme positions, viz., denying the right altogether to the allottee to move the application u/s.7 of the Code and giving an unbridled license to a single person to hold the real estate project and all the stakeholders thereunder hostage to a proceeding under the Code –Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 – s.7. Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (Amendment) Act, 2020 – s.3 – s.3 of the impugned amendment, amended s.7(1) of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016, incorporating three provisos to s.7(1) – The first proviso provided that for financial creditors, referred to in clauses (a) and (b) of sub-section (6A) of s.21, an application for initiating corporate insolvency resolution process against the corporate debtor shall be filed jointly by not less than one hundred of such creditors in the same class or not less than ten per cent of the total number of such creditors in the same class, whichever is less – Challenge to – Held: The first proviso is invulnerable – The legislative understanding is clear that in regard to such creditors bearing the hallmark of large numbers they are required to be treated differently – If they are not treated differently it would spell chaos and the objects of the Code would not be fulfilled It is an extension of this basic principle which has led to the insertion of the impugned proviso – Insisting on a threshold in regard to these categories of creditors would lead to the halt to indiscriminate litigation which would result in an uncontrollable docket explosion as far as the authorities which work the Code are concerned – The debtor who is apparently stressed is relieved of the last straw on the camel’s back, as it were, by halting individual creditors whose views are not shared even by a reasonable number of its peers rushing in with applications – Again, as in the case of the allottees, this is not a situation where while treating them as financial creditors they are totally deprived of the right to apply under s.7 as part of the legislative scheme – The legislative policy reflects an attempt at shielding the corporate debtor from what it considers would be either for frivolous or avoidable applications – All that the amendment is likely to ensure is that the filing of the application is preceded by a consensus at least by a minuscule percentage of similarly placed creditors that the time has come for undertaking a legal odyssey which is beset with perils for the applicants themselves apart from others – As far as the percentage of applicants contemplated under the proviso it is clear that it cannot be dubbed as an arbitrary or capricious figure – Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 – s.7. A Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (Amendment) Act, 2020 – s.4 – s.4 of the impugned amendment, incorporated an additional Explanation in s.11 of the Code – While s.11 is about persons not entitled to make application for initiating corporate insolvency resolution process, the additional Explanation provided that nothing in section 11 prevented a corporate debtor from initiating corporate insolvency resolution process against another corporate debtor – Held: The provisions of the impugned Explanation clearly amount to a clarificatory amendment – A clarificatory amendment is retrospective in nature – The Explanation merely makes the intention of the Legislature clear beyond the pale of doubt – The argument of the petitioners that the amendment came into force only on 28.12.2019 and, therefore, in respect to applications filed under ss.7, 9 or 10, it will not have any bearing, cannot be accepted – The Explanation, in the facts of these cases, is clearly clarificatory in nature and it will certainly apply to all pending applications also – The intention of the Legislature was always to target the corporate debtor only insofar as it purported to prohibit application by the corporate debtor against itself, to prevent abuse of the provisions of the Code – It could never had been the intention of the Legislature to create an obstacle in the path of the corporate debtor, in any of the circumstances contained in s.11, from maximizing its assets by trying to recover the liabilities due to it from others – Not only does it go against the basic commonsense view but it would frustrate the very object of the Code, if a corporate debtor is prevented from invoking the provisions of the Code either by itself or through his resolution professional, who at later stage, may, don the mantle of its liquidator – Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 – s.11, Explanation II. Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (Amendment) Act, 2020 – s.10 – s.10 of the impugned amendment inserts s.32A in the Code – It was contended that but for s.32A, the properties which are acquired could be attached but that is pre-empted by s.32A – The petitioners contend that immunity granted to the corporate debtors and its assets acquired from the proceeds of crimes and any criminal liability arising from the offences of the erstwhile management for the offences committed prior to initiation of CIRP and approval of the resolution plan by the adjudicating authority further jeopardizes the interest of the allottees/creditors – Held: No case whatsoever is made out to seek invalidation of s.32A – The boundaries of this Court’s jurisdiction are clear – The wisdom of the legislation is not open to judicial review – Having regard to the object of the Code, the experience of the working of the code, the interests of all stakeholders including most importantly the imperative need to attract resolution applicants who would not shy away from offering reasonable and fair value as part of the resolution plan if the legislature thought that immunity be granted to the corporate debtor as also its property, it hardly furnishes a ground for this Court to interfere – The provision is carefully thought out – It is not as if the wrongdoers are allowed to get away – They remain liable – The extinguishment of the criminal liability of the corporate debtor is apparently important to the new management to make a clean break with the past and start on a clean slate – The immunity is premised on various conditions being fulfilled – There must be a resolution plan – It must be approved – There must be a change in the control of the corporate debtor – The new management cannot be the disguised avatar of the old management – It cannot even be the related party of the corporate debtor – The new management cannot be the subject matter of an investigation which has resulted in material showing abetment or conspiracy for the commission of the offence and the report or complaint filed thereto – These ingredients are also insisted upon for claiming exemption of the bar from actions against the property – Significantly every person who was associated with the corporate debtor in any manner and who was directly or indirectly involved in the commission of the offence in terms of the report submitted continues to be liable to be prosecuted and punished for the offence committed by the corporate debtor – The corporate debtor and its property in the context of the scheme of the code constitute a distinct subject matter justifying the special treatment accorded to them – Creation of a criminal offence as also abolishing criminal liability must ordinarily be left to the judgement of the legislature – Attaining public welfare very often needs delicate balancing of conflicting interests – As to what priority must be accorded to which interest must remain a legislative value judgement and if seemingly the legislature in its pursuit of the greater good appears to jettison the interests of some it cannot unless it strikingly ill squares with some constitutional mandate suffer invalidation – There is no basis at all to impugn the Section on the ground that it violates Articles 19, 21 or 300A – Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 – s.32A. Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (Amendment) Act, 2020 – s.3 –s.3 of the impugned amendment, amended s.7(1) of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 – Amendment by s.3 of the impugned amendment incorporated three provisos to s.7(1) – The third proviso provided that where an application for initiating the corporate insolvency resolution process against a corporate debtor has been filed by a financial creditor referred to in the first and second provisos and has not been admitted by the Adjudicating Authority before the commencement of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (Amendment) Act, 2020, such application shall be modified to comply with the requirements of the first or second proviso within thirty days of the commencement of the said Act, failing which the application shall be deemed to be withdrawn before its admission – Held: The third proviso is a one-time affair – It is intended only to deal with those applications, u/s.7, which were filed prior to 28.12.2019, when, by way of the impugned Ordinance, initially, the threshold requirements came to be introduced by the first and the second impugned provisos – In other words, the legislative intention was to ensure that no application u/s.7 could be filed after 28.12.2019, except upon complying with the requirements in the first and second provisos – The Legislature did not stop there – It has clearly intended that the threshold requirement it imposed, will apply to all those applications, which were filed, prior to 28.12.2019 as well, subject to the exception that the applications, so filed, had not been admitted, u/s.7(5) – In other words, the Legislature intended that in every application, filed under s.7, by the creditors covered by the first proviso and by the allottees governed by the second proviso, should also be embraced by the newly imposed threshold requirement for which, it was intended, should be complied within 30 days from the date of the Ordinance – However, this restriction was not to apply to those applications which stood admitted as on the date of the Ordinance – It is also clear that the consequence of failure to comply with the threshold requirement, in regard to applications, which have been filed earlier, was that they would stand withdrawn – When applications were filed under the unamended provisions of s.7, at any rate it would transform into a vested right – The vested right is to proceed with the action till its logical and legal conclusion – No doubt, there may not be a vested right as regard mere procedure and while limitation, ordinarily, belongs to the domain of procedure, should new law shorten the existing period of limitation, such a law would not operate in regard to the right of action which is vested – Every sovereign Legislature is clothed with competence to make retrospective laws – It is open to the Legislature, while making retrospective law, to take away vested rights – If a vested right can be taken away by a retrospective law, there can be no reason why the Legislature cannot modify the vested rights – The imposition of a threshold requirement being a mandatory and irreducible minimum even, if it is to be achieved as and after the date of the amendment, constitutes an intrusion into the substantive right of action vested in the individual creditor – The action of the creditor was not a completed transaction – As regards his conduct in the past, viz., moving u/s.7, it is incomplete but the action was commenced – But the law (the 3 rd proviso) impairs the past action qua the future – Imposing the threshold requirement under the 3 rd proviso, is not a mere matter of procedure – It impairs vested rights – Prescribing a time limit in regard to pending applications, cannot be, per se, described as arbitrary, as otherwise, it would be an endless and uncertain procedure – The applications would remain part of the docket and also become a Damocles Sword overhanging the debtor and the other stakeholders with deleterious consequences also qua the objects of the Code – Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 – s.7. Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 – Need of – Held: The Code was an imperative need for the nation to try and catch up with the rest of the world, be it in the matter of ease of doing business, elevating the rate of recovery of loans, maximization of the assets of ailing concerns and also, the balancing the interests of all stakeholders.Amendment – Clarificatory amendment – Is retrospective in nature.Legislation – Plenary Legislation – Challenge to – Grounds – Discussed. Legislation – Plenary Legislation – Challenge to – On ground of malice – Held: While malice may furnish a ground in an appropriate case to veto administrative action, malice does not furnish a ground to attack a plenary law.",

Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (Amendment) Act, 2020 – s.3 –s.3 of the impugned amendment, amended s.7(1) of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 – Amendment by s.3 of the impugned amendment incorporated three provisos to s.7(1) – The third proviso provided that where an application for initiating the corporate insolvency resolution process against a corporate debtor has been filed by a financial creditor referred to in the first and second provisos and has not been admitted by the Adjudicating Authority before the commencement of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (Amendment) Act, 2020, such application shall be modified to comply with the requirements of the first or second proviso within thirty days of the commencement of the said Act, failing which the application shall be deemed to be withdrawn before its admission – Held: The third proviso is a one-time affair – It is intended only to deal with those applications, u/s.7, which were filed prior to 28.12.2019, when, by way of the impugned Ordinance, initially, the threshold requirements came to be introduced by the first and the second impugned provisos – In other words, the legislative intention was to ensure that no application u/s.7 could be filed after 28.12.2019, except upon complying with the requirements in the first and second provisos – The Legislature did not stop there – It has clearly intended that the threshold requirement it imposed, will apply to all those applications, which were filed, prior to 28.12.2019 as well, subject to the exception that the applications, so filed, had not been admitted, u/s.7(5) – In other words, the Legislature intended that in every application, filed under s.7, by the creditors covered by the first proviso and by the allottees governed by the second proviso, should also be embraced by the newly imposed threshold requirement for which, it was intended, should be complied within 30 days from the date of the Ordinance – However, this restriction was not to apply to those applications which stood admitted as on the date of the Ordinance – It is also clear that the consequence of failure to comply with the threshold requirement, in regard to applications, which have been filed earlier, was that they would stand withdrawn – When applications were filed under the unamended provisions of s.7, at any rate it would transform into a vested right – The vested right is to proceed with the action till its logical and legal conclusion – No doubt, there may not be a vested right as regard mere procedure and while limitation, ordinarily, belongs to the domain of procedure, should new law shorten the existing period of limitation, such a law would not operate in regard to the right of action which is vested – Every sovereign Legislature is clothed with competence to make retrospective laws – It is open to the Legislature, while making retrospective law, to take away vested rights – If a vested right can be taken away by a retrospective law, there can be no reason why the Legislature cannot modify the vested rights – The imposition of a threshold requirement being a mandatory and irreducible minimum even, if it is to be achieved as and after the date of the amendment, constitutes an intrusion into the substantive right of action vested in the individual creditor – The action of the creditor was not a completed transaction – As regards his conduct in the past, viz., moving u/s.7, it is incomplete but the action was commenced – But the law (the 3 rd proviso) impairs the past action qua the future – Imposing the threshold requirement under the 3 rd proviso, is not a mere matter of procedure – It impairs vested rights – Prescribing a time limit in regard to pending applications, cannot be, per se, described as arbitrary, as otherwise, it would be an endless and uncertain procedure – The applications would remain part of the docket and also become a Damocles Sword overhanging the debtor and the other stakeholders with deleterious consequences also qua the objects of the Code – Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 – s.7. Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 – Need of – Held: The Code was an imperative need for the nation to try and catch up with the rest of the world, be it in the matter of ease of doing business, elevating the rate of recovery of loans, maximization of the assets of ailing concerns and also, the balancing the interests of all stakeholders.Amendment – Clarificatory amendment – Is retrospective in nature.Legislation – Plenary Legislation – Challenge to – Grounds – Discussed.

        "HeadNote": "Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (Amendment) Act, 2020 – s.3 –s.3 of the impugned amendment, amended s.7(1) of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016, incorporating three provisos to s.7(1) – Under the second proviso, a new threshold was declared for an allottee to move an application u/s.7 for trigerring the insolvency resolution process under the Code – The second proviso provided that for financial creditors who were allottees under a real estate project, an application for initiating corporate insolvency resolution process against the corporate debtor was to be filed jointly by not less than one hundred of such allottees under the same real estate project or not less than ten per cent of the total number of such allottees under the same real estate project, whichever is less – Challenge to the second proviso to s.7(1) – Held: Not tenable – The object of the Statute, admittedly, is to ensure that there is a critical mass of persons (allottees), who agree that the time is ripe to invoke the Code and to submit to the inexorable processes under the Code, with all its attendant perils – The rationale behind, confining allottees to the same real estate project, is to promote the object of the Code – Once the threshold requirement can pass muster when tested in the anvil of a challenge based on Arts. 14, 19 and 21, then, there is both logic and reason behind the legislative value judgment that the allottees, who must join the application under the impugned provisos, must be related to the same real estate project – Allottees under real estate projects are financial creditors, but they possess certain characteristics, which set them apart from generality of the financial creditors, such as numerosity; heterogeneity; and individuality in decision making – If a single allottee, as a financial creditor, is allowed to move an application u/s.7, the interests of all the other allottees may be put in peril – In the circumstances, if the Legislature, taking into consideration, the sheer numbers of a group of creditors, viz., the allottees of real estate projects, finds this to be an intelligible differentia, which distinguishes the allottees from the other financial creditors, who are not found to possess the characteristics of numerosity, then, it is not for this Court to sit in judgment over the wisdom of such a measure – The allottee continues to be a financial creditor – All that is envisaged is the legislative value judgment that a critical mass is indispensable for allottees to be present before the Code, can be activised – The purport of the critical mass of applicants would ensure that a reasonable number of persons similarly circumstanced, form the view that despite the remedies available under the RERA or the Consumer Protection Act or a civil suit, the invoking of the Code is the only way out, in a particular case – If the Legislature felt that having regard to the consequences of an application under the Code, when such a large group of persons, pull at each other, an additional threshold be erected for exercising the right u/s.7, certainly, it cannot suffer a constitutional veto at the hands of Court exercising judicial review of legislation – This is not a case where the right of the allottee is completely taken away – All that has happened is a half-way house is built between extreme positions, viz., denying the right altogether to the allottee to move the application u/s.7 of the Code and giving an unbridled license to a single person to hold the real estate project and all the stakeholders thereunder hostage to a proceeding under the Code –Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 – s.7.

Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (Amendment) Act, 2020 – s.3 –s.3 of the impugned amendment, amended s.7(1) of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 – Amendment by s.3 of the impugned amendment incorporated three provisos to s.7(1) – The third proviso provided that where an application for initiating the corporate insolvency resolution process against a corporate debtor has been filed by a financial creditor referred to in the first and second provisos and has not been admitted by the Adjudicating Authority before the commencement of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (Amendment) Act, 2020, such application shall be modified to comply with the requirements of the first or second proviso within thirty days of the commencement of the said Act, failing which the application shall be deemed to be withdrawn before its admission – Held: The third proviso is a one-time affair – It is intended only to deal with those applications, u/s.7, which were filed prior to 28.12.2019, when, by way of the impugned Ordinance, initially, the threshold requirements came to be introduced by the first and the second impugned provisos – In other words, the legislative intention was to ensure that no application u/s.7 could be filed after 28.12.2019, except upon complying with the requirements in the first and second provisos – The Legislature did not stop there – It has clearly intended that the threshold requirement it imposed, will apply to all those applications, which were filed, prior to 28.12.2019 as well, subject to the exception that the applications, so filed, had not been admitted, u/s.7(5) – In other words, the Legislature intended that in every application, filed under s.7, by the creditors covered by the first proviso and by the allottees governed by the second proviso, should also be embraced by the newly imposed threshold requirement for which, it was intended, should be complied within 30 days from the date of the Ordinance – However, this restriction was not to apply to those applications which stood admitted as on the date of the Ordinance – It is also clear that the consequence of failure to comply with the threshold requirement, in regard to applications, which have been filed earlier, was that they would stand withdrawn – When applications were filed under the unamended provisions of s.7, at any rate it would transform into a vested right – The vested right is to proceed with the action till its logical and legal conclusion – No doubt, there may not be a vested right as regard mere procedure and while limitation, ordinarily, belongs to the domain of procedure, should new law shorten the existing period of limitation, such a law would not operate in regard to the right of action which is vested – Every sovereign Legislature is clothed with competence to make retrospective laws – It is open to the Legislature, while making retrospective law, to take away vested rights – If a vested right can be taken away by a retrospective law, there can be no reason why the Legislature cannot modify the vested rights – The imposition of a threshold requirement being a mandatory and irreducible minimum even, if it is to be achieved as and after the date of the amendment, constitutes an intrusion into the substantive right of action vested in the individual creditor – The action of the creditor was not a completed transaction – As regards his conduct in the past, viz., moving u/s.7, it is incomplete but the action was commenced – But the law (the 3 rd proviso) impairs the past action qua the future – Imposing the threshold requirement under the 3 rd proviso, is not a mere matter of procedure – It impairs vested rights – Prescribing a time limit in regard to pending applications, cannot be, per se, described as arbitrary, as otherwise, it would be an endless and uncertain procedure – The applications would remain part of the docket and also become a Damocles Sword overhanging the debtor and the other stakeholders with deleterious consequences also qua the objects of the Code – Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 – s.7.

        "HeadNote": "Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (Amendment) Act, 2020 – s.3 –s.3 of the impugned amendment, amended s.7(1) of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016, incorporating three provisos to s.7(1) – Under the second proviso, a new threshold was declared for an allottee to move an application u/s.7 for trigerring the insolvency resolution process under the Code – The second proviso provided that for financial creditors who were allottees under a real estate project, an application for initiating corporate insolvency resolution process against the corporate debtor was to be filed jointly by not less than one hundred of such allottees under the same real estate project or not less than ten per cent of the total number of such allottees under the same real estate project, whichever is less – Challenge to the second proviso to s.7(1) – Held: Not tenable – The object of the Statute, admittedly, is to ensure that there is a critical mass of persons (allottees), who agree that the time is ripe to invoke the Code and to submit to the inexorable processes under the Code, with all its attendant perils – The rationale behind, confining allottees to the same real estate project, is to promote the object of the Code – Once the threshold requirement can pass muster when tested in the anvil of a challenge based on Arts. 14, 19 and 21, then, there is both logic and reason behind the legislative value judgment that the allottees, who must join the application under the impugned provisos, must be related to the same real estate project – Allottees under real estate projects are financial creditors, but they possess certain characteristics, which set them apart from generality of the financial creditors, such as numerosity; heterogeneity; and individuality in decision making – If a single allottee, as a financial creditor, is allowed to move an application u/s.7, the interests of all the other allottees may be put in peril – In the circumstances, if the Legislature, taking into consideration, the sheer numbers of a group of creditors, viz., the allottees of real estate projects, finds this to be an intelligible differentia, which distinguishes the allottees from the other financial creditors, who are not found to possess the characteristics of numerosity, then, it is not for this Court to sit in judgment over the wisdom of such a measure – The allottee continues to be a financial creditor – All that is envisaged is the legislative value judgment that a critical mass is indispensable for allottees to be present before the Code, can be activised – The purport of the critical mass of applicants would ensure that a reasonable number of persons similarly circumstanced, form the view that despite the remedies available under the RERA or the Consumer Protection Act or a civil suit, the invoking of the Code is the only way out, in a particular case – If the Legislature felt that having regard to the consequences of an application under the Code, when such a large group of persons, pull at each other, an additional threshold be erected for exercising the right u/s.7, certainly, it cannot suffer a constitutional veto at the hands of Court exercising judicial review of legislation – This is not a case where the right of the allottee is completely taken away – All that has happened is a half-way house is built between extreme positions, viz., denying the right altogether to the allottee to move the application u/s.7 of the Code and giving an unbridled license to a single person to hold the real estate project and all the stakeholders thereunder hostage to a proceeding under the Code –Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 – s.7. Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (Amendment) Act, 2020 – s.3 – s.3 of the impugned amendment, amended s.7(1) of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016, incorporating three provisos to s.7(1) – The first proviso provided that for financial creditors, referred to in clauses (a) and (b) of sub-section (6A) of s.21, an application for initiating corporate insolvency resolution process against the corporate debtor shall be filed jointly by not less than one hundred of such creditors in the same class or not less than ten per cent of the total number of such creditors in the same class, whichever is less – Challenge to – Held: The first proviso is invulnerable – The legislative understanding is clear that in regard to such creditors bearing the hallmark of large numbers they are required to be treated differently – If they are not treated differently it would spell chaos and the objects of the Code would not be fulfilled It is an extension of this basic principle which has led to the insertion of the impugned proviso – Insisting on a threshold in regard to these categories of creditors would lead to the halt to indiscriminate litigation which would result in an uncontrollable docket explosion as far as the authorities which work the Code are concerned – The debtor who is apparently stressed is relieved of the last straw on the camel’s back, as it were, by halting individual creditors whose views are not shared even by a reasonable number of its peers rushing in with applications – Again, as in the case of the allottees, this is not a situation where while treating them as financial creditors they are totally deprived of the right to apply under s.7 as part of the legislative scheme – The legislative policy reflects an attempt at shielding the corporate debtor from what it considers would be either for frivolous or avoidable applications – All that the amendment is likely to ensure is that the filing of the application is preceded by a consensus at least by a minuscule percentage of similarly placed creditors that the time has come for undertaking a legal odyssey which is beset with perils for the applicants themselves apart from others – As far as the percentage of applicants contemplated under the proviso it is clear that it cannot be dubbed as an arbitrary or capricious figure – Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 – s.7. A Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (Amendment) Act, 2020 – s.4 – s.4 of the impugned amendment, incorporated an additional Explanation in s.11 of the Code – While s.11 is about persons not entitled to make application for initiating corporate insolvency resolution process, the additional Explanation provided that nothing in section 11 prevented a corporate debtor from initiating corporate insolvency resolution process against another corporate debtor – Held: The provisions of the impugned Explanation clearly amount to a clarificatory amendment – A clarificatory amendment is retrospective in nature – The Explanation merely makes the intention of the Legislature clear beyond the pale of doubt – The argument of the petitioners that the amendment came into force only on 28.12.2019 and, therefore, in respect to applications filed under ss.7, 9 or 10, it will not have any bearing, cannot be accepted – The Explanation, in the facts of these cases, is clearly clarificatory in nature and it will certainly apply to all pending applications also – The intention of the Legislature was always to target the corporate debtor only insofar as it purported to prohibit application by the corporate debtor against itself, to prevent abuse of the provisions of the Code – It could never had been the intention of the Legislature to create an obstacle in the path of the corporate debtor, in any of the circumstances contained in s.11, from maximizing its assets by trying to recover the liabilities due to it from others – Not only does it go against the basic commonsense view but it would frustrate the very object of the Code, if a corporate debtor is prevented from invoking the provisions of the Code either by itself or through his resolution professional, who at later stage, may, don the mantle of its liquidator – Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 – s.11, Explanation II. Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (Amendment) Act, 2020 – s.10 – s.10 of the impugned amendment inserts s.32A in the Code – It was contended that but for s.32A, the properties which are acquired could be attached but that is pre-empted by s.32A – The petitioners contend that immunity granted to the corporate debtors and its assets acquired from the proceeds of crimes and any criminal liability arising from the offences of the erstwhile management for the offences committed prior to initiation of CIRP and approval of the resolution plan by the adjudicating authority further jeopardizes the interest of the allottees/creditors – Held: No case whatsoever is made out to seek invalidation of s.32A – The boundaries of this Court’s jurisdiction are clear – The wisdom of the legislation is not open to judicial review – Having regard to the object of the Code, the experience of the working of the code, the interests of all stakeholders including most importantly the imperative need to attract resolution applicants who would not shy away from offering reasonable and fair value as part of the resolution plan if the legislature thought that immunity be granted to the corporate debtor as also its property, it hardly furnishes a ground for this Court to interfere – The provision is carefully thought out – It is not as if the wrongdoers are allowed to get away – They remain liable – The extinguishment of the criminal liability of the corporate debtor is apparently important to the new management to make a clean break with the past and start on a clean slate – The immunity is premised on various conditions being fulfilled – There must be a resolution plan – It must be approved – There must be a change in the control of the corporate debtor – The new management cannot be the disguised avatar of the old management – It cannot even be the related party of the corporate debtor – The new management cannot be the subject matter of an investigation which has resulted in material showing abetment or conspiracy for the commission of the offence and the report or complaint filed thereto – These ingredients are also insisted upon for claiming exemption of the bar from actions against the property – Significantly every person who was associated with the corporate debtor in any manner and who was directly or indirectly involved in the commission of the offence in terms of the report submitted continues to be liable to be prosecuted and punished for the offence committed by the corporate debtor – The corporate debtor and its property in the context of the scheme of the code constitute a distinct subject matter justifying the special treatment accorded to them – Creation of a criminal offence as also abolishing criminal liability must ordinarily be left to the judgement of the legislature – Attaining public welfare very often needs delicate balancing of conflicting interests – As to what priority must be accorded to which interest must remain a legislative value judgement and if seemingly the legislature in its pursuit of the greater good appears to jettison the interests of some it cannot unless it strikingly ill squares with some constitutional mandate suffer invalidation – There is no basis at all to impugn the Section on the ground that it violates Articles 19, 21 or 300A – Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 – s.32A. Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (Amendment) Act, 2020 – s.3 –s.3 of the impugned amendment, amended s.7(1) of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 – Amendment by s.3 of the impugned amendment incorporated three provisos to s.7(1) – The third proviso provided that where an application for initiating the corporate insolvency resolution process against a corporate debtor has been filed by a financial creditor referred to in the first and second provisos and has not been admitted by the Adjudicating Authority before the commencement of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (Amendment) Act, 2020, such application shall be modified to comply with the requirements of the first or second proviso within thirty days of the commencement of the said Act, failing which the application shall be deemed to be withdrawn before its admission – Held: The third proviso is a one-time affair – It is intended only to deal with those applications, u/s.7, which were filed prior to 28.12.2019, when, by way of the impugned Ordinance, initially, the threshold requirements came to be introduced by the first and the second impugned provisos – In other words, the legislative intention was to ensure that no application u/s.7 could be filed after 28.12.2019, except upon complying with the requirements in the first and second provisos – The Legislature did not stop there – It has clearly intended that the threshold requirement it imposed, will apply to all those applications, which were filed, prior to 28.12.2019 as well, subject to the exception that the applications, so filed, had not been admitted, u/s.7(5) – In other words, the Legislature intended that in every application, filed under s.7, by the creditors covered by the first proviso and by the allottees governed by the second proviso, should also be embraced by the newly imposed threshold requirement for which, it was intended, should be complied within 30 days from the date of the Ordinance – However, this restriction was not to apply to those applications which stood admitted as on the date of the Ordinance – It is also clear that the consequence of failure to comply with the threshold requirement, in regard to applications, which have been filed earlier, was that they would stand withdrawn – When applications were filed under the unamended provisions of s.7, at any rate it would transform into a vested right – The vested right is to proceed with the action till its logical and legal conclusion – No doubt, there may not be a vested right as regard mere procedure and while limitation, ordinarily, belongs to the domain of procedure, should new law shorten the existing period of limitation, such a law would not operate in regard to the right of action which is vested – Every sovereign Legislature is clothed with competence to make retrospective laws – It is open to the Legislature, while making retrospective law, to take away vested rights – If a vested right can be taken away by a retrospective law, there can be no reason why the Legislature cannot modify the vested rights – The imposition of a threshold requirement being a mandatory and irreducible minimum even, if it is to be achieved as and after the date of the amendment, constitutes an intrusion into the substantive right of action vested in the individual creditor – The action of the creditor was not a completed transaction – As regards his conduct in the past, viz., moving u/s.7, it is incomplete but the action was commenced – But the law (the 3 rd proviso) impairs the past action qua the future – Imposing the threshold requirement under the 3 rd proviso, is not a mere matter of procedure – It impairs vested rights – Prescribing a time limit in regard to pending applications, cannot be, per se, described as arbitrary, as otherwise, it would be an endless and uncertain procedure – The applications would remain part of the docket and also become a Damocles Sword overhanging the debtor and the other stakeholders with deleterious consequences also qua the objects of the Code – Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 – s.7.

National Company Law Appellate Tribunal Rules – rr.14, 22 – Held: It may well be true that waivers on filing an appeal with a certified copy are often granted for the purposes of judicial determination, they do not confer an automatic right on an applicant to dispense with compliance and render r.22(2), NCLAT Rules nugatory.

        "HeadNote": "Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 – s.14 – Negotiable Instrument Act, 1881 – Chapter XVII – ss.138, 141 – Institution/ continuation of proceeding u/s.138/141, NI Act, if covered by the moratorium provision i.e. s.14, IBC – Natural persons if covered by s.14 – Held: A s.138/141 proceeding against a corporate debtor is covered by s.14(1)(a), IBC – A quasi-criminal proceeding contained in Chapter XVII of the NI Act would amount to a “proceeding” within the meaning of s.14(1)(a), the moratorium therefore attaching to such proceeding – As far as the Directors/persons in management or control of the corporate debtor are concerned, a s.138/141 proceeding against them cannot be initiated or continued without the corporate debtor – This is because s.141 speaks of persons in charge of, and responsible to the company for the conduct of the business of the company, as well as the company – For the period of moratorium, since no s.138/141 proceeding can continue or be initiated against the corporate debtor because of a statutory bar, such proceedings can be initiated or continued against the persons mentioned in s.141(1) and (2) of the NI Act – Thus, moratorium provision contained in s.14, IBC would apply only to the corporate debtor, the natural persons mentioned in s.141 continuing to be statutorily liable under Chapter XVII of the NI Act – Interpretation of Statutes. Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 – s.14, ss.3(33), 96(3), 101(3) – “Transaction” in s.3(33) – Scope of s.14 – Held: s.14(1) makes it clear that subject to the exceptions contained in sub-sections (2) and (3), on the insolvency commencement date, the Adjudicating Authority shall mandatorily, by order, declare a moratorium to prohibit what follows in clauses (a) to (d) – s.14(1)(a) does not indicate as to what the proceedings contained therein apply to Sub-section 3(a) provides the answer that such “proceedings” relate to “transactions” entered into by the corporate debtor pre imposition of the moratorium – s.3(33) defines “ transaction” – This definition being an inclusive one is extremely wide in nature and would include a transaction evidencing a debt or liability – This is made clear by s.96(3) and s.101(3) which contain the same language as s.14(3)(a), these Sections speaking of ‘debts’ of the individual or firm. Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 – s.14(3)(b) – Held: By s.14(3)(b), a surety in a contract of guarantee of a debt owed by a corporate debtor cannot avail of the benefit of a moratorium as a result of which a creditor can enforce a guarantee, though not being able to enforce the principal debt during the period of moratorium. Insolvency and Banckruptcy Code, 2016 – s.14 – Object of – Discussed. Doctrines/Principles – noscitur a sociis or ejusdem generis – Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 – s.14 – “proceedings” – Negotiable Instrument Act, 1881 – ss.138, 141 – Held: Ejusdem generis and noscitur a sociis cannot be exalted to nullify the plain meaning of words used in a statute if they are designedly used in a wide sense – Where a residuary phrase is used as a catch-all expression to take within its scope what may reasonably be comprehended by a provision, regard being had to its object and setting, noscitur a sociis cannot be used to colour an otherwise wide expression so as to whittle it down and stultify the object of a statutory provision – noscitur a sociis or ejusdem generis should not be used to cut down the width of the expression “proceedings” so as to make such proceedings analogous to civil suits – Interpretation of Statutes – Rules of construction. Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 – s.14 vis-à-vis ss. 81, 85, 96, 101 – Scope of proceedings – Held: When the language of these Sections is juxtaposed against the language of s.14, it is clear that the width of s.14 is even greater, given that s.14 declares a moratorium prohibiting what is mentioned in clauses (a) to (d) thereof in respect of transactions entered into by the corporate debtor, inclusive of transactions relating to debts, as contained in ss.81, 85, 96, and 101 – Also, s.14(1)(d) is conspicuous by its absence in any of these Sections – Thus, where individuals or firms are concerned, the recovery of any property by an owner or lessor, where such property is occupied by or in possession of the individual or firm can be recovered during the moratorium period, unlike the property of a corporate debtor – Negotiable Instrument Act, 1881 – s.138, 141, 143A, 148. Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 – ss.14, 32A (1) – Interplay between s.14, 32A – Moratorium – Prior offences, liability of corporate debtor – Held: The reason for introducing s.32A had nothing to do with any moratorium provision – It extinguishes criminal liability of the corporate debtor, from the date the resolution plan has been approved by the Adjudicating Authority, so that the new management may make a clean break with the past and start on a clean slate – Whereas, a moratorium provision only casts a shadow on proceedings already initiated and to be initiated – Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (Amendment) Act, 2020 – Doctrine of harmonious construction – Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 – ss.138, 141.Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 – Chapter XVII – s.138- 142 – Nature of proceeding under – Held: A s.138 proceeding can be said to be a “civil sheep” in a “criminal wolf’s” clothing, as it is the interest of the victim that is sought to be protected, the larger interest of the State being subsumed in the victim alone moving a court in cheque bouncing cases – Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 – Chapter XIII – ss.177 to 189; ss.62-64, 302, 357. Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 – s.138 – Object of – Discussed.Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 – s.138 – Explanation to s.138 – Held: It makes clear that the debt or other liability means a legally enforceable debt or other liability – Thus, a debt or other liability barred by the law of limitation would be outside the scope of s.138. Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 – s.138 – Penal Code, 1860 – s.53 – Plea that proceedings u/s.138 can only be described as criminal proceedings – Held: Rejected – There are many instances of acts which are punishable by imprisonment or fine or both which have been described as quasi-criminal – There is nothing wrong with the appellation “quasi-criminal” being applied to a s.138 proceeding – Companies Act, 1956 – s.630 – Contempt of Courts Act, 1971 – ss.2, 11, 12.Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 – s.139 – Presumption under – Discussed. Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 – s.140 – Held: It shall not be a defence in a prosecution for an offence u/s.138 that the drawer had no reason to believe when he issued the cheque that the cheque may be dishonoured on presentment for the reasons stated in that Section, thus strict liability will attach, mens rea being no ingredient of the offence. Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 – ss.14, 25(2), 33(5) – Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 – ss.138, 141 – Doctrines of ejusdem generis and noscitur a sociis – Non-application of – Held: U/ s.33, the expression “no suit or other legal proceeding” occurs both in the enacting part as well as the proviso – Going by the proviso first, given the object that the liquidator has to act on behalf of the company after a winding-up order is passed, which includes filing of suits and other legal proceedings on behalf of the company, there is no reason as to why a s.138/141 proceeding would be outside the ken of the proviso – There is no reason why the liquidator cannot institute a s.138/141 proceeding against a defaulting debtor of the company – Inelegant drafting cannot lead to absurd results or results which stultify the object of a provision, given its otherwise wide language – Interpretation of Statutes. Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 – s.34 – Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 – s.14 – Held: s.34 proceeding is certainly a proceeding against the corporate debtor which may result in an arbitral award against the corporate debtor being upheld, as a result of which, monies would then be payable by the corporate debtor – Power Grid Corporation of India Ltd. v.

Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 – s.14, ss.3(33), 96(3), 101(3) – “Transaction” in s.3(33) – Scope of s.14 – Held: s.14(1) makes it clear that subject to the exceptions contained in sub-sections (2) and (3), on the insolvency commencement date, the Adjudicating Authority shall mandatorily, by order, declare a moratorium to prohibit what follows in clauses (a) to (d) – s.14(1)(a) does not indicate as to what the proceedings contained therein apply to Sub-section 3(a) provides the answer that such “proceedings” relate to “transactions” entered into by the corporate debtor pre imposition of the moratorium – s.3(33) defines “ transaction” – This definition being an inclusive one is extremely wide in nature and would include a transaction evidencing a debt or liability – This is made clear by s.96(3) and s.101(3) which contain the same language as s.14(3)(a), these Sections speaking of ‘debts’ of the individual or firm. Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 – s.14(3)(b) – Held: By s.14(3)(b), a surety in a contract of guarantee of a debt owed by a corporate debtor cannot avail of the benefit of a moratorium as a result of which a creditor can enforce a guarantee, though not being able to enforce the principal debt during the period of moratorium.

Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 – s.138 – Object of – Discussed.Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 – s.138 – Explanation to s.138 – Held: It makes clear that the debt or other liability means a legally enforceable debt or other liability – Thus, a debt or other liability barred by the law of limitation would be outside the scope of s.138. Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 – s.138 – Penal Code, 1860 – s.53 – Plea that proceedings u/s.138 can only be described as criminal proceedings – Held: Rejected – There are many instances of acts which are punishable by imprisonment or fine or both which have been described as quasi-criminal – There is nothing wrong with the appellation “quasi-criminal” being applied to a s.138 proceeding – Companies Act, 1956 – s.630 – Contempt of Courts Act, 1971 – ss.2, 11, 12.Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 – s.139 – Presumption under – Discussed.

Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 – s.34 – Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 – s.14 – Held: s.34 proceeding is certainly a proceeding against the corporate debtor which may result in an arbitral award against the corporate debtor being upheld, as a result of which, monies would then be payable by the corporate debtor – Power Grid Corporation of India Ltd. v. Jyoti Structures Ltd., reported as (2018) 246 DLT 485 does not state the law correctly.Words & Expressions: “or” in s.14(1)(a) – Interpretation of – Held: expression “or” occurs twice in the first part of s.14(1)(a)- first, between the expressions “institution of suits” and “continuation of pending suits” and second, between the expressions “continuation of pending suits” and “proceedings against the corporate debtor...” – Expression “institution of suits or continuation of pending suits” is to be read as one category, and the disjunctive “or” before the word “proceedings” would make it clear that proceedings against the corporate debtor would be a separate category. “proceedings” – Meaning of – Discussed – Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 – s.14.“in respect of” – Held: It is a phrase which is wide and includes anything done directly or indirectly – Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 – ss. 81, 85, 96, 101. “cause of action” – Held: Expression “cause of action” is a foreigner to criminal jurisprudence, and would apply only in civil cases to recover money – Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 – s.14 – Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 – ss.138, 142 – Code of Criminal Procdeure, 1973 – Chapter XIII – ss.177 to 189.

Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 – s.14, ss.3(33), 96(3), 101(3) – “Transaction” in s.3(33) – Scope of s.14 – Held: s.14(1) makes it clear that subject to the exceptions contained in sub-sections (2) and (3), on the insolvency commencement date, the Adjudicating Authority shall mandatorily, by order, declare a moratorium to prohibit what follows in clauses (a) to (d) – s.14(1)(a) does not indicate as to what the proceedings contained therein apply to Sub-section 3(a) provides the answer that such “proceedings” relate to “transactions” entered into by the corporate debtor pre imposition of the moratorium – s.3(33) defines “ transaction” – This definition being an inclusive one is extremely wide in nature and would include a transaction evidencing a debt or liability – This is made clear by s.96(3) and s.101(3) which contain the same language as s.14(3)(a), these Sections speaking of ‘debts’ of the individual or firm. Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 – s.14(3)(b) – Held: By s.14(3)(b), a surety in a contract of guarantee of a debt owed by a corporate debtor cannot avail of the benefit of a moratorium as a result of which a creditor can enforce a guarantee, though not being able to enforce the principal debt during the period of moratorium. Insolvency and Banckruptcy Code, 2016 – s.14 – Object of – Discussed. Doctrines/Principles – noscitur a sociis or ejusdem generis – Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 – s.14 – “proceedings” – Negotiable Instrument Act, 1881 – ss.138, 141 – Held: Ejusdem generis and noscitur a sociis cannot be exalted to nullify the plain meaning of words used in a statute if they are designedly used in a wide sense – Where a residuary phrase is used as a catch-all expression to take within its scope what may reasonably be comprehended by a provision, regard being had to its object and setting, noscitur a sociis cannot be used to colour an otherwise wide expression so as to whittle it down and stultify the object of a statutory provision – noscitur a sociis or ejusdem generis should not be used to cut down the width of the expression “proceedings” so as to make such proceedings analogous to civil suits – Interpretation of Statutes – Rules of construction.

Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 – ss.14, 32A (1) – Interplay between s.14, 32A – Moratorium – Prior offences, liability of corporate debtor – Held: The reason for introducing s.32A had nothing to do with any moratorium provision – It extinguishes criminal liability of the corporate debtor, from the date the resolution plan has been approved by the Adjudicating Authority, so that the new management may make a clean break with the past and start on a clean slate – Whereas, a moratorium provision only casts a shadow on proceedings already initiated and to be initiated – Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (Amendment) Act, 2020 – Doctrine of harmonious construction – Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 – ss.138, 141.Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 – Chapter XVII – s.138- 142 – Nature of proceeding under – Held: A s.138 proceeding can be said to be a “civil sheep” in a “criminal wolf’s” clothing, as it is the interest of the victim that is sought to be protected, the larger interest of the State being subsumed in the victim alone moving a court in cheque bouncing cases – Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 – Chapter XIII – ss.177 to 189; ss.62-64, 302, 357. Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 – s.138 – Object of – Discussed.Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 – s.138 – Explanation to s.138 – Held: It makes clear that the debt or other liability means a legally enforceable debt or other liability – Thus, a debt or other liability barred by the law of limitation would be outside the scope of s.138. Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 – s.138 – Penal Code, 1860 – s.53 – Plea that proceedings u/s.138 can only be described as criminal proceedings – Held: Rejected – There are many instances of acts which are punishable by imprisonment or fine or both which have been described as quasi-criminal – There is nothing wrong with the appellation “quasi-criminal” being applied to a s.138 proceeding – Companies Act, 1956 – s.630 – Contempt of Courts Act, 1971 – ss.2, 11, 12.Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 – s.139 – Presumption under – Discussed. Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 – s.140 – Held: It shall not be a defence in a prosecution for an offence u/s.138 that the drawer had no reason to believe when he issued the cheque that the cheque may be dishonoured on presentment for the reasons stated in that Section, thus strict liability will attach, mens rea being no ingredient of the offence. Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 – ss.14, 25(2), 33(5) – Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 – ss.138, 141 – Doctrines of ejusdem generis and noscitur a sociis – Non-application of – Held: U/ s.33, the expression “no suit or other legal proceeding” occurs both in the enacting part as well as the proviso – Going by the proviso first, given the object that the liquidator has to act on behalf of the company after a winding-up order is passed, which includes filing of suits and other legal proceedings on behalf of the company, there is no reason as to why a s.138/141 proceeding would be outside the ken of the proviso – There is no reason why the liquidator cannot institute a s.138/141 proceeding against a defaulting debtor of the company – Inelegant drafting cannot lead to absurd results or results which stultify the object of a provision, given its otherwise wide language – Interpretation of Statutes. Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 – s.34 – Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 – s.14 – Held: s.34 proceeding is certainly a proceeding against the corporate debtor which may result in an arbitral award against the corporate debtor being upheld, as a result of which, monies would then be payable by the corporate debtor – Power Grid Corporation of India Ltd. v. Jyoti Structures Ltd., reported as (2018) 246 DLT 485 does not state the law correctly.Words & Expressions: “or” in s.14(1)(a) – Interpretation of – Held: expression “or” occurs twice in the first part of s.14(1)(a)- first, between the expressions “institution of suits” and “continuation of pending suits” and second, between the expressions “continuation of pending suits” and “proceedings against the corporate debtor...” – Expression “institution of suits or continuation of pending suits” is to be read as one category, and the disjunctive “or” before the word “proceedings” would make it clear that proceedings against the corporate debtor would be a separate category. “proceedings” – Meaning of – Discussed – Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 – s.14.“in respect of” – Held: It is a phrase which is wide and includes anything done directly or indirectly – Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 – ss. 81, 85, 96, 101. “cause of action” – Held: Expression “cause of action” is a foreigner to criminal jurisprudence, and would apply only in civil cases to recover money – Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 – s.14 – Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 – ss.138, 142 – Code of Criminal Procdeure, 1973 – Chapter XIII – ss.177 to 189.
