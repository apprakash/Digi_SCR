State of Tamil Nadu – Present case is proceeded on the premise that the confession is admissible – Even if it is admissible, the Court has to be satisfied that it is a voluntary statement, free from any pressure and also that the accused was apprised of his rights before recording the confession – No such material has been brought on record – Confession, especially a confession recorded when the accused is in custody, is a weak piece of evidence and there must be some corroborative evidence –Other than the two confessional statements, one of the co-accused and the other of the appellant, the prosecution has gathered no evidence to link the appellant with the commission of the offence – Confession of the co-accused, which was said to be a corroborative piece of evidence is of no material value – Evidence not sufficient to convict the appellant – Both the Trial Court and the High Court wrongly convicted the appellant – Judgment of both the Courts below, set aside. Evidence – Confession – Admissibility of – Discussed. ",

Mutwalliship – Succession – Right of cognatic heirs of waqif – Held: For hereditary succession to mutwalliship cognatic heirs cannot be excluded as they are also included as descendants of the deceased under muslim law, though considered a more distant class of heirs than agnatic heirs – In order to establish claim for such succession, intention of the waqif, as manifested either through the directions given in the waqf deed or the creation of a custom is of paramount importance – In the facts of the present case it is evident that the waqif did not intend to exclude the cognatic heirs to succeed to mutwalliship."

        "HeadNote": "Custodial Torture: Writ petition filed under Art.32 of the Constitution – Seeking effective and purposive legislative framework/law based upon the ‘Convention against torture and Other Cruel, inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment’ adopted by the United Nations General Assembly – Prayer of applicant was that custodial torture being crime against humanity which directly infracts and violates Art.21, this court should invoke and exercise jurisdiction under Arts.141, 142 for protection and advancement of human dignity, a core and non-negotiable constitutional right – Held: It is true that in some extraordinary cases where notwithstanding the institutional reasons and the division of power, this Court has laid down general rules/guidelines when there has been a clear, substantive and gross human rights violation, which significantly outweighed and dwarfed any legitimising concerns based upon separation of powers, lack of expertise and uncertainty of the consequences – However, a mere allegation of violation of human rights or a plea raising environmental concerns cannot be the ‘bright-line’ to hold that self\u0002restraint must give way to judicial legislation – Where and when directions should be issued by Court are questions and issues involving constitutional dilemmas that mandate a larger debate and discussion – Such directions are to be issued with great care and circumspection and certainly not when the matter is already pending consideration and debate with the executive or Parliament – This is not a case which requires Court’s intervention to give a suggestion for need to frame a law as the matter is already pending active consideration – Any direction at this stage would be interpreted as judicial participation in the enactment of law – When the matter is already pending consideration and is being examined for the purpose of legislation, it would not be appropriate for this Court to enforce its opinion, be it in the form of a direction or even a request, for it would clearly undermine and conflict with the role assigned to the judiciary under the Constitution – No directions can be given to the executive to ratify the UN Convention for it would virtually amount to issuing directions to enact laws in conformity with the UN Convention – Constitution of India – Arts.21, 32, 141, 142. Constitution of India: Separation of powers – India has a written Constitution which is supreme and adumbrates as well as divides powers, roles and functions of the three wings of the State - the legislature, the executive and the judiciary – These divisions are boundaries and limits fixed by the Constitution to check and prevent transgression by any one of the three branches into the powers, functions and tasks that fall within the domain of the other wing – The three branches have to respect the constitutional division and not disturb the allocation of roles and functions between the triad – Adherence to the constitutional scheme dividing the powers and functions is a guard and check against potential abuse of power and the rule of law is secured when each branch observes the constitutional limitations to their powers, functions and roles – Modern theory of separation of powers does not accept that the three branches perform mutually isolated roles and functions and accepts a need for coordinated institutional effort for good governance, albeit emphasise on benefits of division of power and labour by accepting the three wings do have separate and distinct roles and functions that are defined by the Constitution – All the institutions must act within their own jurisdictions and not trespass into the jurisdiction of other – By segregating the powers and functions of the institutions, the Constitution ensures a structure where the institutions function as per their institutional strengths. Constitution of India: Powers and functions of legislature – Held: The legislature as an elected and representative body enacts laws to give effect to and fulfil democratic aspirations of the people – Legislature functions as a deliberative and representative body – It is directly accountable and answerable to the electorate and citizens of this country – This representativeness and principle of accountability is what gives legitimacy to the legislations and laws made by Parliament or the state legislatures. Constitution of India: Arts.73 and 162 – Powers and functions of executive – Held: The executive has the primary responsibility of formulating government policies and proposing legislations which when passed by the legislature become laws – By virtue of Arts.73 and 162 of the Constitution, the powers and functions of the executive are wide and expansive, as they cover matters in respect of which Parliament/state legislature can make laws and vests with the executive the authority and jurisdiction exercisable by the Government of India or the State Government, as the case may be – As a delegate of the legislative bodies and subject to the terms of the legislation, the executive makes second stage laws known as ‘subordinate or delegated legislation’ – In fields where there is no legislation, the executive has the power to frame policies, schemes, etc., which is co-extensive with the power of Parliament or the state legislature to make laws – At the same time, the political executive is accountable to the legislature and holds office till they enjoy the support and confidence of the legislature – Thus, there is interdependence, interaction and even commonality of personnel/ members of the legislature and the executive – The executive, therefore, performs multi-functional role and is not monolithic. Constitution of India: Role of judiciary – Judges unlike members of the legislature represent no one, strictly speaking not even the citizens – Judges are not accountable and answerable as the political executive is to the legislature and the elected representatives are to the electorate – This independence ensures that the judges perform the constitutional function of safeguarding the supremacy of the Constitution while exercising the power of judicial review in a fair and even-handed manner without pressure and favours – As an interpreter, guardian and protector of the Constitution, the judiciary checks and curbs violation of the Constitution by the Government when they overstep their constitutional limits, violate the basic structure of the Constitution, infringe fundamental rights or act contrary to law – Power of judicial review has expanded taking within its ambit the concept of social and economic justice – Yet, while exercising this power of judicial review, the courts do not encroach upon the field marked by the Constitution for the legislature and the executive, as the courts examine legality and validity of the legislation or the governmental action, and not the wisdom behind the legislative measure or relative merits or demerits of the governmental action – Neither does the Constitution permit the courts to direct, advise or sermonise others in the spheres reserved for them by the Constitution, provided the legislature or the executive do not transgress their constitutional limits or statutory conditions. Doctrines/Principles: Doctrine of separation of power – The doctrine restrains the legislature from declaring the judgment of a court to be void and of no effect, while the legislature still possesses the legislative competence of enacting a validating law which remedies the defect pointed out in the judgment – However, this does not ordain and permit the legislature to declare a judgment as invalid by enacting a law, but permits the legislature to take away the basis of the judgment by fundamentally altering the basis on which it was pronounced – Therefore, while exercising all important checks and balances function, each wing should be conscious of the enormous responsibility that rests on them to ensure that institutional respect and comity is maintained – Constitution of India – Judgment/Order – Legislation. Doctrines/Principles: Doctrine of separation of power – Distinction between interpretation and adjudication by the courts on one hand and the power to enact legislation by the legislature on the other – Adjudication results in what is often described as judge made law, but the interpretation of the statutes and the rights in accordance with the provisions of Articles 14, 19 and 21 in the course of adjudication is not an attempt or an act of legislation by the judges – Legislature itself entrusts the judiciary to lay down parameters in the form of precedents which is oft-spoken as judge made law – Such law, even if made by the judiciary, would not infringe the doctrine of separation of powers and is in conformity with the constitutional functions – Thus, law-making within certain limits is a legitimate element of a judge’s role, if not inevitable – A judge has to adjudicate and decide on the basis of legal provisions, which when indeterminate on a particular issue require elucidation and explanation – This requires a judge to interpret the provisions to decide the case and, in this process, he may take recourse and rely upon fundamental rights, including the right to life, but even then he does not legislate a law while interpreting such provisions – Such interpretation is called ‘judge made law’ but not legislation – Constitution of India – Judge made law. ‘The Constitutional Separation of Powers’ by Aieleen Kavanagh – referred to. Legislation: Power/Duty of legislature and judiciary – Distinction between – Held: Legislating or law-making involves a choice to prioritise certain political, moral and social values over the others from a wide range of choices that exist before the legislature – It is a balancing and integrating exercise to give expression/meaning to diverse and alternative values and blend it in a manner that it is representative of several viewpoints so that it garners support from other elected representatives to pass institutional muster and acceptance – Legislation, in the form of an enactment or laws, lays down broad and general principles – It is the source of law which the judges are called upon to apply – Judges, when they apply the law, are constrained by the rules of language and by well identified background presumptions as to the manner in which the legislature intended the law to be read – Application of law by the judges is not synonymous with the enactment of law by the legislature – Judges have the power to spell out how precisely the statute would apply in a particular case – In this manner, they complete the law formulated by the legislature by applying it – This power of interpretation or the power of judicial review is exercised post the enactment of law, which is then made subject matter of interpretation or challenge before the courts. Interpretation of statutes: While exercising the interpretative power, the courts can draw strength from the spirit and propelling elements underlying the Constitution to realise the constitutional values but must remain alive to the concept of judicial restraint which requires the judges to decide cases within defined limits of power – Thus, the courts would not accept submissions and pass orders purely on a matter of policy or formulate judicial legislation which is for the executive or elected representatives of the people to enact.",

        "HeadNote": "Custodial Torture: Writ petition filed under Art.32 of the Constitution – Seeking effective and purposive legislative framework/law based upon the ‘Convention against torture and Other Cruel, inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment’ adopted by the United Nations General Assembly – Prayer of applicant was that custodial torture being crime against humanity which directly infracts and violates Art.21, this court should invoke and exercise jurisdiction under Arts.141, 142 for protection and advancement of human dignity, a core and non-negotiable constitutional right – Held: It is true that in some extraordinary cases where notwithstanding the institutional reasons and the division of power, this Court has laid down general rules/guidelines when there has been a clear, substantive and gross human rights violation, which significantly outweighed and dwarfed any legitimising concerns based upon separation of powers, lack of expertise and uncertainty of the consequences – However, a mere allegation of violation of human rights or a plea raising environmental concerns cannot be the ‘bright-line’ to hold that self\u0002restraint must give way to judicial legislation – Where and when directions should be issued by Court are questions and issues involving constitutional dilemmas that mandate a larger debate and discussion – Such directions are to be issued with great care and circumspection and certainly not when the matter is already pending consideration and debate with the executive or Parliament – This is not a case which requires Court’s intervention to give a suggestion for need to frame a law as the matter is already pending active consideration – Any direction at this stage would be interpreted as judicial participation in the enactment of law – When the matter is already pending consideration and is being examined for the purpose of legislation, it would not be appropriate for this Court to enforce its opinion, be it in the form of a direction or even a request, for it would clearly undermine and conflict with the role assigned to the judiciary under the Constitution – No directions can be given to the executive to ratify the UN Convention for it would virtually amount to issuing directions to enact laws in conformity with the UN Convention – Constitution of India – Arts.21, 32, 141, 142. Constitution of India: Separation of powers – India has a written Constitution which is supreme and adumbrates as well as divides powers, roles and functions of the three wings of the State - the legislature, the executive and the judiciary – These divisions are boundaries and limits fixed by the Constitution to check and prevent transgression by any one of the three branches into the powers, functions and tasks that fall within the domain of the other wing – The three branches have to respect the constitutional division and not disturb the allocation of roles and functions between the triad – Adherence to the constitutional scheme dividing the powers and functions is a guard and check against potential abuse of power and the rule of law is secured when each branch observes the constitutional limitations to their powers, functions and roles – Modern theory of separation of powers does not accept that the three branches perform mutually isolated roles and functions and accepts a need for coordinated institutional effort for good governance, albeit emphasise on benefits of division of power and labour by accepting the three wings do have separate and distinct roles and functions that are defined by the Constitution – All the institutions must act within their own jurisdictions and not trespass into the jurisdiction of other – By segregating the powers and functions of the institutions, the Constitution ensures a structure where the institutions function as per their institutional strengths. Constitution of India: Powers and functions of legislature – Held: The legislature as an elected and representative body enacts laws to give effect to and fulfil democratic aspirations of the people – Legislature functions as a deliberative and representative body – It is directly accountable and answerable to the electorate and citizens of this country – This representativeness and principle of accountability is what gives legitimacy to the legislations and laws made by Parliament or the state legislatures. Constitution of India: Arts.73 and 162 – Powers and functions of executive – Held: The executive has the primary responsibility of formulating government policies and proposing legislations which when passed by the legislature become laws – By virtue of Arts.73 and 162 of the Constitution, the powers and functions of the executive are wide and expansive, as they cover matters in respect of which Parliament/state legislature can make laws and vests with the executive the authority and jurisdiction exercisable by the Government of India or the State Government, as the case may be – As a delegate of the legislative bodies and subject to the terms of the legislation, the executive makes second stage laws known as ‘subordinate or delegated legislation’ – In fields where there is no legislation, the executive has the power to frame policies, schemes, etc., which is co-extensive with the power of Parliament or the state legislature to make laws – At the same time, the political executive is accountable to the legislature and holds office till they enjoy the support and confidence of the legislature – Thus, there is interdependence, interaction and even commonality of personnel/ members of the legislature and the executive – The executive, therefore, performs multi-functional role and is not monolithic. Constitution of India: Role of judiciary – Judges unlike members of the legislature represent no one, strictly speaking not even the citizens – Judges are not accountable and answerable as the political executive is to the legislature and the elected representatives are to the electorate – This independence ensures that the judges perform the constitutional function of safeguarding the supremacy of the Constitution while exercising the power of judicial review in a fair and even-handed manner without pressure and favours – As an interpreter, guardian and protector of the Constitution, the judiciary checks and curbs violation of the Constitution by the Government when they overstep their constitutional limits, violate the basic structure of the Constitution, infringe fundamental rights or act contrary to law – Power of judicial review has expanded taking within its ambit the concept of social and economic justice – Yet, while exercising this power of judicial review, the courts do not encroach upon the field marked by the Constitution for the legislature and the executive, as the courts examine legality and validity of the legislation or the governmental action, and not the wisdom behind the legislative measure or relative merits or demerits of the governmental action – Neither does the Constitution permit the courts to direct, advise or sermonise others in the spheres reserved for them by the Constitution, provided the legislature or the executive do not transgress their constitutional limits or statutory conditions. Doctrines/Principles: Doctrine of separation of power – The doctrine restrains the legislature from declaring the judgment of a court to be void and of no effect, while the legislature still possesses the legislative competence of enacting a validating law which remedies the defect pointed out in the judgment – However, this does not ordain and permit the legislature to declare a judgment as invalid by enacting a law, but permits the legislature to take away the basis of the judgment by fundamentally altering the basis on which it was pronounced – Therefore, while exercising all important checks and balances function, each wing should be conscious of the enormous responsibility that rests on them to ensure that institutional respect and comity is maintained – Constitution of India – Judgment/Order – Legislation. Doctrines/Principles: Doctrine of separation of power – Distinction between interpretation and adjudication by the courts on one hand and the power to enact legislation by the legislature on the other – Adjudication results in what is often described as judge made law, but the interpretation of the statutes and the rights in accordance with the provisions of Articles 14, 19 and 21 in the course of adjudication is not an attempt or an act of legislation by the judges – Legislature itself entrusts the judiciary to lay down parameters in the form of precedents which is oft-spoken as judge made law – Such law, even if made by the judiciary, would not infringe the doctrine of separation of powers and is in conformity with the constitutional functions – Thus, law-making within certain limits is a legitimate element of a judge’s role, if not inevitable – A judge has to adjudicate and decide on the basis of legal provisions, which when indeterminate on a particular issue require elucidation and explanation – This requires a judge to interpret the provisions to decide the case and, in this process, he may take recourse and rely upon fundamental rights, including the right to life, but even then he does not legislate a law while interpreting such provisions – Such interpretation is called ‘judge made law’ but not legislation – Constitution of India – Judge made law. ‘The Constitutional Separation of Powers’ by Aieleen Kavanagh – referred to. Legislation: Power/Duty of legislature and judiciary – Distinction between – Held: Legislating or law-making involves a choice to prioritise certain political, moral and social values over the others from a wide range of choices that exist before the legislature – It is a balancing and integrating exercise to give expression/meaning to diverse and alternative values and blend it in a manner that it is representative of several viewpoints so that it garners support from other elected representatives to pass institutional muster and acceptance – Legislation, in the form of an enactment or laws, lays down broad and general principles – It is the source of law which the judges are called upon to apply – Judges, when they apply the law, are constrained by the rules of language and by well identified background presumptions as to the manner in which the legislature intended the law to be read – Application of law by the judges is not synonymous with the enactment of law by the legislature – Judges have the power to spell out how precisely the statute would apply in a particular case – In this manner, they complete the law formulated by the legislature by applying it – This power of interpretation or the power of judicial review is exercised post the enactment of law, which is then made subject matter of interpretation or challenge before the courts. Interpretation of statutes: While exercising the interpretative power, the courts can draw strength from the spirit and propelling elements underlying the Constitution to realise the constitutional values but must remain alive to the concept of judicial restraint which requires the judges to decide cases within defined limits of power – Thus, the courts would not accept submissions and pass orders purely on a matter of policy or formulate judicial legislation which is for the executive or elected representatives of the people to enact.",

        "HeadNote": "Custodial Torture: Writ petition filed under Art.32 of the Constitution – Seeking effective and purposive legislative framework/law based upon the ‘Convention against torture and Other Cruel, inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment’ adopted by the United Nations General Assembly – Prayer of applicant was that custodial torture being crime against humanity which directly infracts and violates Art.21, this court should invoke and exercise jurisdiction under Arts.141, 142 for protection and advancement of human dignity, a core and non-negotiable constitutional right – Held: It is true that in some extraordinary cases where notwithstanding the institutional reasons and the division of power, this Court has laid down general rules/guidelines when there has been a clear, substantive and gross human rights violation, which significantly outweighed and dwarfed any legitimising concerns based upon separation of powers, lack of expertise and uncertainty of the consequences – However, a mere allegation of violation of human rights or a plea raising environmental concerns cannot be the ‘bright-line’ to hold that self\u0002restraint must give way to judicial legislation – Where and when directions should be issued by Court are questions and issues involving constitutional dilemmas that mandate a larger debate and discussion – Such directions are to be issued with great care and circumspection and certainly not when the matter is already pending consideration and debate with the executive or Parliament – This is not a case which requires Court’s intervention to give a suggestion for need to frame a law as the matter is already pending active consideration – Any direction at this stage would be interpreted as judicial participation in the enactment of law – When the matter is already pending consideration and is being examined for the purpose of legislation, it would not be appropriate for this Court to enforce its opinion, be it in the form of a direction or even a request, for it would clearly undermine and conflict with the role assigned to the judiciary under the Constitution – No directions can be given to the executive to ratify the UN Convention for it would virtually amount to issuing directions to enact laws in conformity with the UN Convention – Constitution of India – Arts.21, 32, 141, 142. Constitution of India: Separation of powers – India has a written Constitution which is supreme and adumbrates as well as divides powers, roles and functions of the three wings of the State - the legislature, the executive and the judiciary – These divisions are boundaries and limits fixed by the Constitution to check and prevent transgression by any one of the three branches into the powers, functions and tasks that fall within the domain of the other wing – The three branches have to respect the constitutional division and not disturb the allocation of roles and functions between the triad – Adherence to the constitutional scheme dividing the powers and functions is a guard and check against potential abuse of power and the rule of law is secured when each branch observes the constitutional limitations to their powers, functions and roles – Modern theory of separation of powers does not accept that the three branches perform mutually isolated roles and functions and accepts a need for coordinated institutional effort for good governance, albeit emphasise on benefits of division of power and labour by accepting the three wings do have separate and distinct roles and functions that are defined by the Constitution – All the institutions must act within their own jurisdictions and not trespass into the jurisdiction of other – By segregating the powers and functions of the institutions, the Constitution ensures a structure where the institutions function as per their institutional strengths. Constitution of India: Powers and functions of legislature – Held: The legislature as an elected and representative body enacts laws to give effect to and fulfil democratic aspirations of the people – Legislature functions as a deliberative and representative body – It is directly accountable and answerable to the electorate and citizens of this country – This representativeness and principle of accountability is what gives legitimacy to the legislations and laws made by Parliament or the state legislatures. Constitution of India: Arts.73 and 162 – Powers and functions of executive – Held: The executive has the primary responsibility of formulating government policies and proposing legislations which when passed by the legislature become laws – By virtue of Arts.73 and 162 of the Constitution, the powers and functions of the executive are wide and expansive, as they cover matters in respect of which Parliament/state legislature can make laws and vests with the executive the authority and jurisdiction exercisable by the Government of India or the State Government, as the case may be – As a delegate of the legislative bodies and subject to the terms of the legislation, the executive makes second stage laws known as ‘subordinate or delegated legislation’ – In fields where there is no legislation, the executive has the power to frame policies, schemes, etc., which is co-extensive with the power of Parliament or the state legislature to make laws – At the same time, the political executive is accountable to the legislature and holds office till they enjoy the support and confidence of the legislature – Thus, there is interdependence, interaction and even commonality of personnel/ members of the legislature and the executive – The executive, therefore, performs multi-functional role and is not monolithic. Constitution of India: Role of judiciary – Judges unlike members of the legislature represent no one, strictly speaking not even the citizens – Judges are not accountable and answerable as the political executive is to the legislature and the elected representatives are to the electorate – This independence ensures that the judges perform the constitutional function of safeguarding the supremacy of the Constitution while exercising the power of judicial review in a fair and even-handed manner without pressure and favours – As an interpreter, guardian and protector of the Constitution, the judiciary checks and curbs violation of the Constitution by the Government when they overstep their constitutional limits, violate the basic structure of the Constitution, infringe fundamental rights or act contrary to law – Power of judicial review has expanded taking within its ambit the concept of social and economic justice – Yet, while exercising this power of judicial review, the courts do not encroach upon the field marked by the Constitution for the legislature and the executive, as the courts examine legality and validity of the legislation or the governmental action, and not the wisdom behind the legislative measure or relative merits or demerits of the governmental action – Neither does the Constitution permit the courts to direct, advise or sermonise others in the spheres reserved for them by the Constitution, provided the legislature or the executive do not transgress their constitutional limits or statutory conditions. Doctrines/Principles: Doctrine of separation of power – The doctrine restrains the legislature from declaring the judgment of a court to be void and of no effect, while the legislature still possesses the legislative competence of enacting a validating law which remedies the defect pointed out in the judgment – However, this does not ordain and permit the legislature to declare a judgment as invalid by enacting a law, but permits the legislature to take away the basis of the judgment by fundamentally altering the basis on which it was pronounced – Therefore, while exercising all important checks and balances function, each wing should be conscious of the enormous responsibility that rests on them to ensure that institutional respect and comity is maintained – Constitution of India – Judgment/Order – Legislation. Doctrines/Principles: Doctrine of separation of power – Distinction between interpretation and adjudication by the courts on one hand and the power to enact legislation by the legislature on the other – Adjudication results in what is often described as judge made law, but the interpretation of the statutes and the rights in accordance with the provisions of Articles 14, 19 and 21 in the course of adjudication is not an attempt or an act of legislation by the judges – Legislature itself entrusts the judiciary to lay down parameters in the form of precedents which is oft-spoken as judge made law – Such law, even if made by the judiciary, would not infringe the doctrine of separation of powers and is in conformity with the constitutional functions – Thus, law-making within certain limits is a legitimate element of a judge’s role, if not inevitable – A judge has to adjudicate and decide on the basis of legal provisions, which when indeterminate on a particular issue require elucidation and explanation – This requires a judge to interpret the provisions to decide the case and, in this process, he may take recourse and rely upon fundamental rights, including the right to life, but even then he does not legislate a law while interpreting such provisions – Such interpretation is called ‘judge made law’ but not legislation – Constitution of India – Judge made law. ‘The Constitutional Separation of Powers’ by Aieleen Kavanagh – referred to. Legislation: Power/Duty of legislature and judiciary – Distinction between – Held: Legislating or law-making involves a choice to prioritise certain political, moral and social values over the others from a wide range of choices that exist before the legislature – It is a balancing and integrating exercise to give expression/meaning to diverse and alternative values and blend it in a manner that it is representative of several viewpoints so that it garners support from other elected representatives to pass institutional muster and acceptance – Legislation, in the form of an enactment or laws, lays down broad and general principles – It is the source of law which the judges are called upon to apply – Judges, when they apply the law, are constrained by the rules of language and by well identified background presumptions as to the manner in which the legislature intended the law to be read – Application of law by the judges is not synonymous with the enactment of law by the legislature – Judges have the power to spell out how precisely the statute would apply in a particular case – In this manner, they complete the law formulated by the legislature by applying it – This power of interpretation or the power of judicial review is exercised post the enactment of law, which is then made subject matter of interpretation or challenge before the courts. Interpretation of statutes: While exercising the interpretative power, the courts can draw strength from the spirit and propelling elements underlying the Constitution to realise the constitutional values but must remain alive to the concept of judicial restraint which requires the judges to decide cases within defined limits of power – Thus, the courts would not accept submissions and pass orders purely on a matter of policy or formulate judicial legislation which is for the executive or elected representatives of the people to enact.",

        "HeadNote": "Custodial Torture: Writ petition filed under Art.32 of the Constitution – Seeking effective and purposive legislative framework/law based upon the ‘Convention against torture and Other Cruel, inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment’ adopted by the United Nations General Assembly – Prayer of applicant was that custodial torture being crime against humanity which directly infracts and violates Art.21, this court should invoke and exercise jurisdiction under Arts.141, 142 for protection and advancement of human dignity, a core and non-negotiable constitutional right – Held: It is true that in some extraordinary cases where notwithstanding the institutional reasons and the division of power, this Court has laid down general rules/guidelines when there has been a clear, substantive and gross human rights violation, which significantly outweighed and dwarfed any legitimising concerns based upon separation of powers, lack of expertise and uncertainty of the consequences – However, a mere allegation of violation of human rights or a plea raising environmental concerns cannot be the ‘bright-line’ to hold that self\u0002restraint must give way to judicial legislation – Where and when directions should be issued by Court are questions and issues involving constitutional dilemmas that mandate a larger debate and discussion – Such directions are to be issued with great care and circumspection and certainly not when the matter is already pending consideration and debate with the executive or Parliament – This is not a case which requires Court’s intervention to give a suggestion for need to frame a law as the matter is already pending active consideration – Any direction at this stage would be interpreted as judicial participation in the enactment of law – When the matter is already pending consideration and is being examined for the purpose of legislation, it would not be appropriate for this Court to enforce its opinion, be it in the form of a direction or even a request, for it would clearly undermine and conflict with the role assigned to the judiciary under the Constitution – No directions can be given to the executive to ratify the UN Convention for it would virtually amount to issuing directions to enact laws in conformity with the UN Convention – Constitution of India – Arts.21, 32, 141, 142. Constitution of India: Separation of powers – India has a written Constitution which is supreme and adumbrates as well as divides powers, roles and functions of the three wings of the State - the legislature, the executive and the judiciary – These divisions are boundaries and limits fixed by the Constitution to check and prevent transgression by any one of the three branches into the powers, functions and tasks that fall within the domain of the other wing – The three branches have to respect the constitutional division and not disturb the allocation of roles and functions between the triad – Adherence to the constitutional scheme dividing the powers and functions is a guard and check against potential abuse of power and the rule of law is secured when each branch observes the constitutional limitations to their powers, functions and roles – Modern theory of separation of powers does not accept that the three branches perform mutually isolated roles and functions and accepts a need for coordinated institutional effort for good governance, albeit emphasise on benefits of division of power and labour by accepting the three wings do have separate and distinct roles and functions that are defined by the Constitution – All the institutions must act within their own jurisdictions and not trespass into the jurisdiction of other – By segregating the powers and functions of the institutions, the Constitution ensures a structure where the institutions function as per their institutional strengths. Constitution of India: Powers and functions of legislature – Held: The legislature as an elected and representative body enacts laws to give effect to and fulfil democratic aspirations of the people – Legislature functions as a deliberative and representative body – It is directly accountable and answerable to the electorate and citizens of this country – This representativeness and principle of accountability is what gives legitimacy to the legislations and laws made by Parliament or the state legislatures. Constitution of India: Arts.73 and 162 – Powers and functions of executive – Held: The executive has the primary responsibility of formulating government policies and proposing legislations which when passed by the legislature become laws – By virtue of Arts.73 and 162 of the Constitution, the powers and functions of the executive are wide and expansive, as they cover matters in respect of which Parliament/state legislature can make laws and vests with the executive the authority and jurisdiction exercisable by the Government of India or the State Government, as the case may be – As a delegate of the legislative bodies and subject to the terms of the legislation, the executive makes second stage laws known as ‘subordinate or delegated legislation’ – In fields where there is no legislation, the executive has the power to frame policies, schemes, etc., which is co-extensive with the power of Parliament or the state legislature to make laws – At the same time, the political executive is accountable to the legislature and holds office till they enjoy the support and confidence of the legislature – Thus, there is interdependence, interaction and even commonality of personnel/ members of the legislature and the executive – The executive, therefore, performs multi-functional role and is not monolithic. Constitution of India: Role of judiciary – Judges unlike members of the legislature represent no one, strictly speaking not even the citizens – Judges are not accountable and answerable as the political executive is to the legislature and the elected representatives are to the electorate – This independence ensures that the judges perform the constitutional function of safeguarding the supremacy of the Constitution while exercising the power of judicial review in a fair and even-handed manner without pressure and favours – As an interpreter, guardian and protector of the Constitution, the judiciary checks and curbs violation of the Constitution by the Government when they overstep their constitutional limits, violate the basic structure of the Constitution, infringe fundamental rights or act contrary to law – Power of judicial review has expanded taking within its ambit the concept of social and economic justice – Yet, while exercising this power of judicial review, the courts do not encroach upon the field marked by the Constitution for the legislature and the executive, as the courts examine legality and validity of the legislation or the governmental action, and not the wisdom behind the legislative measure or relative merits or demerits of the governmental action – Neither does the Constitution permit the courts to direct, advise or sermonise others in the spheres reserved for them by the Constitution, provided the legislature or the executive do not transgress their constitutional limits or statutory conditions. Doctrines/Principles: Doctrine of separation of power – The doctrine restrains the legislature from declaring the judgment of a court to be void and of no effect, while the legislature still possesses the legislative competence of enacting a validating law which remedies the defect pointed out in the judgment – However, this does not ordain and permit the legislature to declare a judgment as invalid by enacting a law, but permits the legislature to take away the basis of the judgment by fundamentally altering the basis on which it was pronounced – Therefore, while exercising all important checks and balances function, each wing should be conscious of the enormous responsibility that rests on them to ensure that institutional respect and comity is maintained – Constitution of India – Judgment/Order – Legislation. Doctrines/Principles: Doctrine of separation of power – Distinction between interpretation and adjudication by the courts on one hand and the power to enact legislation by the legislature on the other – Adjudication results in what is often described as judge made law, but the interpretation of the statutes and the rights in accordance with the provisions of Articles 14, 19 and 21 in the course of adjudication is not an attempt or an act of legislation by the judges – Legislature itself entrusts the judiciary to lay down parameters in the form of precedents which is oft-spoken as judge made law – Such law, even if made by the judiciary, would not infringe the doctrine of separation of powers and is in conformity with the constitutional functions – Thus, law-making within certain limits is a legitimate element of a judge’s role, if not inevitable – A judge has to adjudicate and decide on the basis of legal provisions, which when indeterminate on a particular issue require elucidation and explanation – This requires a judge to interpret the provisions to decide the case and, in this process, he may take recourse and rely upon fundamental rights, including the right to life, but even then he does not legislate a law while interpreting such provisions – Such interpretation is called ‘judge made law’ but not legislation – Constitution of India – Judge made law. ‘The Constitutional Separation of Powers’ by Aieleen Kavanagh – referred to. Legislation: Power/Duty of legislature and judiciary – Distinction between – Held: Legislating or law-making involves a choice to prioritise certain political, moral and social values over the others from a wide range of choices that exist before the legislature – It is a balancing and integrating exercise to give expression/meaning to diverse and alternative values and blend it in a manner that it is representative of several viewpoints so that it garners support from other elected representatives to pass institutional muster and acceptance – Legislation, in the form of an enactment or laws, lays down broad and general principles – It is the source of law which the judges are called upon to apply – Judges, when they apply the law, are constrained by the rules of language and by well identified background presumptions as to the manner in which the legislature intended the law to be read – Application of law by the judges is not synonymous with the enactment of law by the legislature – Judges have the power to spell out how precisely the statute would apply in a particular case – In this manner, they complete the law formulated by the legislature by applying it – This power of interpretation or the power of judicial review is exercised post the enactment of law, which is then made subject matter of interpretation or challenge before the courts. Interpretation of statutes: While exercising the interpretative power, the courts can draw strength from the spirit and propelling elements underlying the Constitution to realise the constitutional values but must remain alive to the concept of judicial restraint which requires the judges to decide cases within defined limits of power – Thus, the courts would not accept submissions and pass orders purely on a matter of policy or formulate judicial legislation which is for the executive or elected representatives of the people to enact.",

        "HeadNote": "Custodial Torture: Writ petition filed under Art.32 of the Constitution – Seeking effective and purposive legislative framework/law based upon the ‘Convention against torture and Other Cruel, inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment’ adopted by the United Nations General Assembly – Prayer of applicant was that custodial torture being crime against humanity which directly infracts and violates Art.21, this court should invoke and exercise jurisdiction under Arts.141, 142 for protection and advancement of human dignity, a core and non-negotiable constitutional right – Held: It is true that in some extraordinary cases where notwithstanding the institutional reasons and the division of power, this Court has laid down general rules/guidelines when there has been a clear, substantive and gross human rights violation, which significantly outweighed and dwarfed any legitimising concerns based upon separation of powers, lack of expertise and uncertainty of the consequences – However, a mere allegation of violation of human rights or a plea raising environmental concerns cannot be the ‘bright-line’ to hold that self\u0002restraint must give way to judicial legislation – Where and when directions should be issued by Court are questions and issues involving constitutional dilemmas that mandate a larger debate and discussion – Such directions are to be issued with great care and circumspection and certainly not when the matter is already pending consideration and debate with the executive or Parliament – This is not a case which requires Court’s intervention to give a suggestion for need to frame a law as the matter is already pending active consideration – Any direction at this stage would be interpreted as judicial participation in the enactment of law – When the matter is already pending consideration and is being examined for the purpose of legislation, it would not be appropriate for this Court to enforce its opinion, be it in the form of a direction or even a request, for it would clearly undermine and conflict with the role assigned to the judiciary under the Constitution – No directions can be given to the executive to ratify the UN Convention for it would virtually amount to issuing directions to enact laws in conformity with the UN Convention – Constitution of India – Arts.21, 32, 141, 142. Constitution of India: Separation of powers – India has a written Constitution which is supreme and adumbrates as well as divides powers, roles and functions of the three wings of the State - the legislature, the executive and the judiciary – These divisions are boundaries and limits fixed by the Constitution to check and prevent transgression by any one of the three branches into the powers, functions and tasks that fall within the domain of the other wing – The three branches have to respect the constitutional division and not disturb the allocation of roles and functions between the triad – Adherence to the constitutional scheme dividing the powers and functions is a guard and check against potential abuse of power and the rule of law is secured when each branch observes the constitutional limitations to their powers, functions and roles – Modern theory of separation of powers does not accept that the three branches perform mutually isolated roles and functions and accepts a need for coordinated institutional effort for good governance, albeit emphasise on benefits of division of power and labour by accepting the three wings do have separate and distinct roles and functions that are defined by the Constitution – All the institutions must act within their own jurisdictions and not trespass into the jurisdiction of other – By segregating the powers and functions of the institutions, the Constitution ensures a structure where the institutions function as per their institutional strengths. Constitution of India: Powers and functions of legislature – Held: The legislature as an elected and representative body enacts laws to give effect to and fulfil democratic aspirations of the people – Legislature functions as a deliberative and representative body – It is directly accountable and answerable to the electorate and citizens of this country – This representativeness and principle of accountability is what gives legitimacy to the legislations and laws made by Parliament or the state legislatures. Constitution of India: Arts.73 and 162 – Powers and functions of executive – Held: The executive has the primary responsibility of formulating government policies and proposing legislations which when passed by the legislature become laws – By virtue of Arts.73 and 162 of the Constitution, the powers and functions of the executive are wide and expansive, as they cover matters in respect of which Parliament/state legislature can make laws and vests with the executive the authority and jurisdiction exercisable by the Government of India or the State Government, as the case may be – As a delegate of the legislative bodies and subject to the terms of the legislation, the executive makes second stage laws known as ‘subordinate or delegated legislation’ – In fields where there is no legislation, the executive has the power to frame policies, schemes, etc., which is co-extensive with the power of Parliament or the state legislature to make laws – At the same time, the political executive is accountable to the legislature and holds office till they enjoy the support and confidence of the legislature – Thus, there is interdependence, interaction and even commonality of personnel/ members of the legislature and the executive – The executive, therefore, performs multi-functional role and is not monolithic. Constitution of India: Role of judiciary – Judges unlike members of the legislature represent no one, strictly speaking not even the citizens – Judges are not accountable and answerable as the political executive is to the legislature and the elected representatives are to the electorate – This independence ensures that the judges perform the constitutional function of safeguarding the supremacy of the Constitution while exercising the power of judicial review in a fair and even-handed manner without pressure and favours – As an interpreter, guardian and protector of the Constitution, the judiciary checks and curbs violation of the Constitution by the Government when they overstep their constitutional limits, violate the basic structure of the Constitution, infringe fundamental rights or act contrary to law – Power of judicial review has expanded taking within its ambit the concept of social and economic justice – Yet, while exercising this power of judicial review, the courts do not encroach upon the field marked by the Constitution for the legislature and the executive, as the courts examine legality and validity of the legislation or the governmental action, and not the wisdom behind the legislative measure or relative merits or demerits of the governmental action – Neither does the Constitution permit the courts to direct, advise or sermonise others in the spheres reserved for them by the Constitution, provided the legislature or the executive do not transgress their constitutional limits or statutory conditions. Doctrines/Principles: Doctrine of separation of power – The doctrine restrains the legislature from declaring the judgment of a court to be void and of no effect, while the legislature still possesses the legislative competence of enacting a validating law which remedies the defect pointed out in the judgment – However, this does not ordain and permit the legislature to declare a judgment as invalid by enacting a law, but permits the legislature to take away the basis of the judgment by fundamentally altering the basis on which it was pronounced – Therefore, while exercising all important checks and balances function, each wing should be conscious of the enormous responsibility that rests on them to ensure that institutional respect and comity is maintained – Constitution of India – Judgment/Order – Legislation. Doctrines/Principles: Doctrine of separation of power – Distinction between interpretation and adjudication by the courts on one hand and the power to enact legislation by the legislature on the other – Adjudication results in what is often described as judge made law, but the interpretation of the statutes and the rights in accordance with the provisions of Articles 14, 19 and 21 in the course of adjudication is not an attempt or an act of legislation by the judges – Legislature itself entrusts the judiciary to lay down parameters in the form of precedents which is oft-spoken as judge made law – Such law, even if made by the judiciary, would not infringe the doctrine of separation of powers and is in conformity with the constitutional functions – Thus, law-making within certain limits is a legitimate element of a judge’s role, if not inevitable – A judge has to adjudicate and decide on the basis of legal provisions, which when indeterminate on a particular issue require elucidation and explanation – This requires a judge to interpret the provisions to decide the case and, in this process, he may take recourse and rely upon fundamental rights, including the right to life, but even then he does not legislate a law while interpreting such provisions – Such interpretation is called ‘judge made law’ but not legislation – Constitution of India – Judge made law. ‘The Constitutional Separation of Powers’ by Aieleen Kavanagh – referred to. Legislation: Power/Duty of legislature and judiciary – Distinction between – Held: Legislating or law-making involves a choice to prioritise certain political, moral and social values over the others from a wide range of choices that exist before the legislature – It is a balancing and integrating exercise to give expression/meaning to diverse and alternative values and blend it in a manner that it is representative of several viewpoints so that it garners support from other elected representatives to pass institutional muster and acceptance – Legislation, in the form of an enactment or laws, lays down broad and general principles – It is the source of law which the judges are called upon to apply – Judges, when they apply the law, are constrained by the rules of language and by well identified background presumptions as to the manner in which the legislature intended the law to be read – Application of law by the judges is not synonymous with the enactment of law by the legislature – Judges have the power to spell out how precisely the statute would apply in a particular case – In this manner, they complete the law formulated by the legislature by applying it – This power of interpretation or the power of judicial review is exercised post the enactment of law, which is then made subject matter of interpretation or challenge before the courts. Interpretation of statutes: While exercising the interpretative power, the courts can draw strength from the spirit and propelling elements underlying the Constitution to realise the constitutional values but must remain alive to the concept of judicial restraint which requires the judges to decide cases within defined limits of power – Thus, the courts would not accept submissions and pass orders purely on a matter of policy or formulate judicial legislation which is for the executive or elected representatives of the people to enact.",

Delhi School Education Rules, 1973 – r.105 – “by another year” – Meaning of – Held: The plain reading of the words “by another year” implies that the appointing authority of an institution may extend the period of probation by one additional year over and above the mandatory year of probation with the prior approval of the Director – R.105(1) of the 1973 Rules, therefore, stipulates a limitation on the total probationary period to two years – The first proviso stipulates that the prior approval of the Director shall not be required in the case of a minority institution. Interpretation of Statutes – Ordinary and literal construction of the words – Held: It is a settled position of law that where the words of a statute are clear and unambiguous, they must be interpreted in their ordinary grammatical sense, unless the interpretation leads to an absurd result – It is only where the language of a statute, in its ordinary meaning and grammatical construction, leads to a manifest contradiction, or to some inconvenience or absurdity, hardship or injustice, that a construction may be put upon it which modifies the meaning of the words. Interpretation of Statutes – Objective of a proviso – Held: It is a settled position of law that the objective of a proviso is to carve out from the main section a class or category to which the main section does not apply – A proviso must prima facie be read and considered in relation to the principal matter to which it is a proviso – It is not a separate or independent enactment.",

Delhi School Education Rules, 1973 – r.105 – “by another year” – Meaning of – Held: The plain reading of the words “by another year” implies that the appointing authority of an institution may extend the period of probation by one additional year over and above the mandatory year of probation with the prior approval of the Director – R.105(1) of the 1973 Rules, therefore, stipulates a limitation on the total probationary period to two years – The first proviso stipulates that the prior approval of the Director shall not be required in the case of a minority institution. Interpretation of Statutes – Ordinary and literal construction of the words – Held: It is a settled position of law that where the words of a statute are clear and unambiguous, they must be interpreted in their ordinary grammatical sense, unless the interpretation leads to an absurd result – It is only where the language of a statute, in its ordinary meaning and grammatical construction, leads to a manifest contradiction, or to some inconvenience or absurdity, hardship or injustice, that a construction may be put upon it which modifies the meaning of the words. Interpretation of Statutes – Objective of a proviso – Held: It is a settled position of law that the objective of a proviso is to carve out from the main section a class or category to which the main section does not apply – A proviso must prima facie be read and considered in relation to the principal matter to which it is a proviso – It is not a separate or independent enactment.",

Course, an essential qualification, however appeared on the basis of order passed by the High Court – Thereafter, he completed his B.S.T.C. second year course – Select list was declared– Though the respondent secured more marks than the cut-off, his name was not found in the Select List – Writ petition filed by the respondent relying on the proviso to r.266(3) (which if not available, the respondent would not be eligible on the last date for filing application, as he had admittedly not passed the B.S.T.C. Course on that date) for quashing the list and direction to appoint the respondent to the post of Teacher Grade III (Level I) with all consequential benefits – Dismissed– Division Bench allowed the writ petition holding that the proviso to r.266(3) remained intact despite the substitution of r.266(3) by Notification dtd. 11.5.11 – On appeal, held: Proviso was introduced for the first time on 1.7.04 – By virtue of the amendment dtd. 28.6.06, the qualifications in clause (3) of r.266 came to be changed and new qualifications came to be introduced – Fact that the proviso had ceased to exist as a result of the said substitution is unambiguously demonstrated by the fact that the rule making authority issued notification dtd. 29.11.06, by again inserting the proviso to r.266(3) – Thereafter again on 11.5.11, r.266(3) came to be substituted – Qualifications as stipulated by National Council for Teachers Education (NCTE) were inserted – Thus, r.266 (3) as was brought into life by the amending Act dtd. 28.6.06 continued to hold the field till it suffered substitution by notification dtd. 11.5.11 – Admittedly after 11.5.11, the proviso has not been brought back to life – Notification dtd. 29.11.06 bringing the proviso back to life after the substitution of clause (3) to r.266 in 2006 was not brought to the notice of the High Court– Further, the circular dtd. 29.2.12, replacing the requirement of the candidate possessing qualifications as on the last date, stipulated in the advertisement with the provisions of the proviso (though the proviso was not actually there), cannot be pressed into service by the respondent as the advertisement concerned in the present case is of the year 2013– Impugned judgment set aside – Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act, 2009 – s.23 – Rajasthan Panchayati Raj (Fourth Amendment) Rules 2004 – Interpretation of Statutes. Interpretation of Statutes– Substitution of the provision – Effect of– Held: An amendment bringing about substitution of a provision essentially does two things, in the first place, the provision which is substituted undergoes a repeal and at the same time, there is a re-enactment through the newly inserted provisions.",

Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 – ss.3 and 4 – Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988 – s.8 and 13(2) – r/w. s.13(1)(d) – Interrogation of the accused – Interferences of Judiciary in – Held: Interrogation of the accused and the answers elicited from the accused and the opinion whether the answers given by the accused are ‘satisfactory’ or ‘evasive’, is purely within the domain of the investigating agency and the Court cannot substitute its views by conducting mini trial at various stages of investigation. Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 – ss.3 and 4 – Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 – s.438 – Grant of anticipatory bail – Prosecution alleged irregularities in Foreign Investment Promotion Board (FIPB) clearance given to a company for receiving foreign investment to the tune of Rs.305 crores against approved inflow of Rs.4.62 crores – Appellant was the then finance minister – FIR was registered – Enforcement Directorate also registered a case u/ss. 3 and 4 of PMLA against the accused persons – High Court dismissed the application for grant of anticipatory bail filed by the appellant – On appeal, held: Power u/s.438 Cr.P.C. is an extraordinary power and the same has to be exercised sparingly more so, in cases of economic offences – Economic offences stand as a different class as they effect the economic fabric of the society – Grant of anticipatory bail at the stage of investigation may frustrate the investigating agency in interrogating the accused and in collecting the useful information and also the materials which might have been concealed – Success is such interrogation would elude if the accused knows that he is protected by the order of the Court – In the instant case, having regard to the materials collected by the respondent- Enforcement Directorate and considering the stage of investigation, it was not a fit case to grant anticipatory bail. Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 – s.438 – Constitution of India – Art. 21 – Right of anticipatory bail, a part of Art.21 of the Constitution of India or not – Held: The legislative intent behind the introduction of s.438 Cr.P.C. is to safeguard the individual’s personal liberty and to protect him from the possibility of being humiliated and from being subjected to unnecessary police custody. However, the court must also keep in view that a criminal offence is not just an offence against an individual, rather the larger societal interest is at stake – Therefore, a delicate balance is required to be established between the two rights-safeguarding the personal liberty of an individual and the societal interest – It cannot be said that refusal to grant anticipatory bail would amount to denial of the rights conferred upon the appellant u/Art. 21 of the Constitution of India. Words and Phrases – ‘reason to believe’ – Held: As per definition in s.26 IPC, a person is said to be have ‘reason to believe’ a thing, if he has sufficient cause to believe that thing but not otherwise – The specified officer must have ‘reason to believe’ on the basis of material in his possession that the property sought to be attached is likely to be concealed, transferred on dealt with in a manner which may result in frustrating any proceedings for confiscation of their property under the Prevention of Money - Laundering Act, 2002. Words and Phrases – Economic offence – discussed.",

Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 – ss.3 and 4 – Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988 – s.8 and 13(2) – r/w. s.13(1)(d) – Interrogation of the accused – Interferences of Judiciary in – Held: Interrogation of the accused and the answers elicited from the accused and the opinion whether the answers given by the accused are ‘satisfactory’ or ‘evasive’, is purely within the domain of the investigating agency and the Court cannot substitute its views by conducting mini trial at various stages of investigation. Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 – ss.3 and 4 – Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 – s.438 – Grant of anticipatory bail – Prosecution alleged irregularities in Foreign Investment Promotion Board (FIPB) clearance given to a company for receiving foreign investment to the tune of Rs.305 crores against approved inflow of Rs.4.62 crores – Appellant was the then finance minister – FIR was registered – Enforcement Directorate also registered a case u/ss. 3 and 4 of PMLA against the accused persons – High Court dismissed the application for grant of anticipatory bail filed by the appellant – On appeal, held: Power u/s.438 Cr.P.C. is an extraordinary power and the same has to be exercised sparingly more so, in cases of economic offences – Economic offences stand as a different class as they effect the economic fabric of the society – Grant of anticipatory bail at the stage of investigation may frustrate the investigating agency in interrogating the accused and in collecting the useful information and also the materials which might have been concealed – Success is such interrogation would elude if the accused knows that he is protected by the order of the Court – In the instant case, having regard to the materials collected by the respondent- Enforcement Directorate and considering the stage of investigation, it was not a fit case to grant anticipatory bail. Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 – s.438 – Constitution of India – Art. 21 – Right of anticipatory bail, a part of Art.21 of the Constitution of India or not – Held: The legislative intent behind the introduction of s.438 Cr.P.C. is to safeguard the individual’s personal liberty and to protect him from the possibility of being humiliated and from being subjected to unnecessary police custody. However, the court must also keep in view that a criminal offence is not just an offence against an individual, rather the larger societal interest is at stake – Therefore, a delicate balance is required to be established between the two rights-safeguarding the personal liberty of an individual and the societal interest – It cannot be said that refusal to grant anticipatory bail would amount to denial of the rights conferred upon the appellant u/Art. 21 of the Constitution of India. Words and Phrases – ‘reason to believe’ – Held: As per definition in s.26 IPC, a person is said to be have ‘reason to believe’ a thing, if he has sufficient cause to believe that thing but not otherwise – The specified officer must have ‘reason to believe’ on the basis of material in his possession that the property sought to be attached is likely to be concealed, transferred on dealt with in a manner which may result in frustrating any proceedings for confiscation of their property under the Prevention of Money - Laundering Act, 2002.

Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 – ss.3 and 4 – Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988 – s.8 and 13(2) – r/w. s.13(1)(d) – Interrogation of the accused – Interferences of Judiciary in – Held: Interrogation of the accused and the answers elicited from the accused and the opinion whether the answers given by the accused are ‘satisfactory’ or ‘evasive’, is purely within the domain of the investigating agency and the Court cannot substitute its views by conducting mini trial at various stages of investigation. Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 – ss.3 and 4 – Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 – s.438 – Grant of anticipatory bail – Prosecution alleged irregularities in Foreign Investment Promotion Board (FIPB) clearance given to a company for receiving foreign investment to the tune of Rs.305 crores against approved inflow of Rs.4.62 crores – Appellant was the then finance minister – FIR was registered – Enforcement Directorate also registered a case u/ss. 3 and 4 of PMLA against the accused persons – High Court dismissed the application for grant of anticipatory bail filed by the appellant – On appeal, held: Power u/s.438 Cr.P.C. is an extraordinary power and the same has to be exercised sparingly more so, in cases of economic offences – Economic offences stand as a different class as they effect the economic fabric of the society – Grant of anticipatory bail at the stage of investigation may frustrate the investigating agency in interrogating the accused and in collecting the useful information and also the materials which might have been concealed – Success is such interrogation would elude if the accused knows that he is protected by the order of the Court – In the instant case, having regard to the materials collected by the respondent- Enforcement Directorate and considering the stage of investigation, it was not a fit case to grant anticipatory bail. Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 – s.438 – Constitution of India – Art. 21 – Right of anticipatory bail, a part of Art.21 of the Constitution of India or not – Held: The legislative intent behind the introduction of s.438 Cr.P.C. is to safeguard the individual’s personal liberty and to protect him from the possibility of being humiliated and from being subjected to unnecessary police custody. However, the court must also keep in view that a criminal offence is not just an offence against an individual, rather the larger societal interest is at stake – Therefore, a delicate balance is required to be established between the two rights-safeguarding the personal liberty of an individual and the societal interest – It cannot be said that refusal to grant anticipatory bail would amount to denial of the rights conferred upon the appellant u/Art. 21 of the Constitution of India. Words and Phrases – ‘reason to believe’ – Held: As per definition in s.26 IPC, a person is said to be have ‘reason to believe’ a thing, if he has sufficient cause to believe that thing but not otherwise – The specified officer must have ‘reason to believe’ on the basis of material in his possession that the property sought to be attached is likely to be concealed, transferred on dealt with in a manner which may result in frustrating any proceedings for confiscation of their property under the Prevention of Money - Laundering Act, 2002. Words and Phrases – Economic offence – discussed.",

Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 – ss.3 and 4 – Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988 – s.8 and 13(2) – r/w. s.13(1)(d) – Interrogation of the accused – Interferences of Judiciary in – Held: Interrogation of the accused and the answers elicited from the accused and the opinion whether the answers given by the accused are ‘satisfactory’ or ‘evasive’, is purely within the domain of the investigating agency and the Court cannot substitute its views by conducting mini trial at various stages of investigation. Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 – ss.3 and 4 – Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 – s.438 – Grant of anticipatory bail – Prosecution alleged irregularities in Foreign Investment Promotion Board (FIPB) clearance given to a company for receiving foreign investment to the tune of Rs.305 crores against approved inflow of Rs.4.62 crores – Appellant was the then finance minister – FIR was registered – Enforcement Directorate also registered a case u/ss. 3 and 4 of PMLA against the accused persons – High Court dismissed the application for grant of anticipatory bail filed by the appellant – On appeal, held: Power u/s.438 Cr.P.C. is an extraordinary power and the same has to be exercised sparingly more so, in cases of economic offences – Economic offences stand as a different class as they effect the economic fabric of the society – Grant of anticipatory bail at the stage of investigation may frustrate the investigating agency in interrogating the accused and in collecting the useful information and also the materials which might have been concealed – Success is such interrogation would elude if the accused knows that he is protected by the order of the Court – In the instant case, having regard to the materials collected by the respondent- Enforcement Directorate and considering the stage of investigation, it was not a fit case to grant anticipatory bail. Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 – s.438 – Constitution of India – Art. 21 – Right of anticipatory bail, a part of Art.21 of the Constitution of India or not – Held: The legislative intent behind the introduction of s.438 Cr.P.C. is to safeguard the individual’s personal liberty and to protect him from the possibility of being humiliated and from being subjected to unnecessary police custody. However, the court must also keep in view that a criminal offence is not just an offence against an individual, rather the larger societal interest is at stake – Therefore, a delicate balance is required to be established between the two rights-safeguarding the personal liberty of an individual and the societal interest – It cannot be said that refusal to grant anticipatory bail would amount to denial of the rights conferred upon the appellant u/Art. 21 of the Constitution of India. Words and Phrases – ‘reason to believe’ – Held: As per definition in s.26 IPC, a person is said to be have ‘reason to believe’ a thing, if he has sufficient cause to believe that thing but not otherwise – The specified officer must have ‘reason to believe’ on the basis of material in his possession that the property sought to be attached is likely to be concealed, transferred on dealt with in a manner which may result in frustrating any proceedings for confiscation of their property under the Prevention of Money - Laundering Act, 2002.

        "content": "3 and 4 of PMLA against the accused persons – High Court dismissed the application for grant of anticipatory bail filed by the appellant – On appeal, held: Power u/s.438 Cr.P.C. is an extraordinary power and the same has to be exercised sparingly more so, in cases of economic offences – Economic offences stand as a different class as they effect the economic fabric of the society – Grant of anticipatory bail at the stage of investigation may frustrate the investigating agency in interrogating the accused and in collecting the useful information and also the materials which might have been concealed – Success is such interrogation would elude if the accused knows that he is protected by the order of the Court – In the instant case, having regard to the materials collected by the respondent- Enforcement Directorate and considering the stage of investigation, it was not a fit case to grant anticipatory bail. Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 – s.438 – Constitution of India – Art."

        "HeadNote": "Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 – ss.3 and 4 – Production of Documents in a sealed cover for custodial interrogation – Prosecution alleged irregularities in Foreign Investment Promotion Board (FIPB) clearance given to a company for receiving foreign investment to the tune of Rs.305 crores against approved inflow of Rs.4.62 crores – Appellant was the then finance minister – CBI registered FIR against the appellant and other accused persons u/s.120 IPC r/w. s.420 IPC, s.8 and s.13(2) r/w. s.13(1)(d) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988 – Enforcement Directorate also registered a case u/ss.3 and 4 of PMLA against the accused persons – High Court dismissed the application for the grant of anticipatory bail filed by the appellant and held it to be a classic case of money-laundering – On appeal, before the Supreme Court, respondent sought to produce the materials so collected in a sealed cover and requested the Court to peruse the documents and materials to satisfy the conscience of the Court as to the necessity for the custodial interrogation – Respondent contended that the materials so collected cannot be shared with appellant at the initial stage when the Court was considering the matter for grant of pre\u0002arrest bail – Appellant contended that respondent cannot rely upon the documents without furnishing those documents to the appellant or without questioning the appellant about the materials – Held: The Court can receive the materials/documents collected during the investigation and peruse the same to satisfy its conscience that the investigation is proceeding in the right lines and for the purpose of consideration of grant of bail/anticipatory bail etc. - In the instant case, sealed cover was received by the Court, however, the Court refrained from opening the sealed cover and perusing the documents because if Court had made observations after perusal of the materials, it might have caused prejudice to the appellant and other co-accused who were not before the Court – Suffice to note that it was the stage of considering the pre-arrest bail – In the initial stages of investigation where the Court is considering the question of grant of regular bail or pre-arrest bail, it is not for the Court to enter into the demarcated function of the investigation and collection of evidence/materials for establishing the offence and interrogation of the accused and the witnesses – Since, the respondent had collected documents/materials for custodial interrogation of the appellant, the submission of the respondent was accepted for the limited purpose of refusing pre-arrest bail to the appellant – Penal Code, 1860 – s.120B r/w. s.13(1)(d). Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 – ss.3 and 4 – Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988 – s.8 and 13(2) – r/w. s.13(1)(d) – Interrogation of the accused – Interferences of Judiciary in – Held: Interrogation of the accused and the answers elicited from the accused and the opinion whether the answers given by the accused are ‘satisfactory’ or ‘evasive’, is purely within the domain of the investigating agency and the Court cannot substitute its views by conducting mini trial at various stages of investigation. Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 – ss.3 and 4 – Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 – s.438 – Grant of anticipatory bail – Prosecution alleged irregularities in Foreign Investment Promotion Board (FIPB) clearance given to a company for receiving foreign investment to the tune of Rs.305 crores against approved inflow of Rs.4.62 crores – Appellant was the then finance minister – FIR was registered – Enforcement Directorate also registered a case u/ss. 3 and 4 of PMLA against the accused persons – High Court dismissed the application for grant of anticipatory bail filed by the appellant – On appeal, held: Power u/s.438 Cr.P.C. is an extraordinary power and the same has to be exercised sparingly more so, in cases of economic offences – Economic offences stand as a different class as they effect the economic fabric of the society – Grant of anticipatory bail at the stage of investigation may frustrate the investigating agency in interrogating the accused and in collecting the useful information and also the materials which might have been concealed – Success is such interrogation would elude if the accused knows that he is protected by the order of the Court – In the instant case, having regard to the materials collected by the respondent- Enforcement Directorate and considering the stage of investigation, it was not a fit case to grant anticipatory bail. Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 – s.438 – Constitution of India – Art. 21 – Right of anticipatory bail, a part of Art.21 of the Constitution of India or not – Held: The legislative intent behind the introduction of s.438 Cr.P.C. is to safeguard the individual’s personal liberty and to protect him from the possibility of being humiliated and from being subjected to unnecessary police custody. However, the court must also keep in view that a criminal offence is not just an offence against an individual, rather the larger societal interest is at stake – Therefore, a delicate balance is required to be established between the two rights-safeguarding the personal liberty of an individual and the societal interest – It cannot be said that refusal to grant anticipatory bail would amount to denial of the rights conferred upon the appellant u/Art. 21 of the Constitution of India. Words and Phrases – ‘reason to believe’ – Held: As per definition in s.26 IPC, a person is said to be have ‘reason to believe’ a thing, if he has sufficient cause to believe that thing but not otherwise – The specified officer must have ‘reason to believe’ on the basis of material in his possession that the property sought to be attached is likely to be concealed, transferred on dealt with in a manner which may result in frustrating any proceedings for confiscation of their property under the Prevention of Money - Laundering Act, 2002. Words and Phrases – Economic offence – discussed.",

Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 – ss.3 and 4 – Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988 – s.8 and 13(2) – r/w. s.13(1)(d) – Interrogation of the accused – Interferences of Judiciary in – Held: Interrogation of the accused and the answers elicited from the accused and the opinion whether the answers given by the accused are ‘satisfactory’ or ‘evasive’, is purely within the domain of the investigating agency and the Court cannot substitute its views by conducting mini trial at various stages of investigation. Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 – ss.3 and 4 – Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 – s.438 – Grant of anticipatory bail – Prosecution alleged irregularities in Foreign Investment Promotion Board (FIPB) clearance given to a company for receiving foreign investment to the tune of Rs.305 crores against approved inflow of Rs.4.62 crores – Appellant was the then finance minister – FIR was registered – Enforcement Directorate also registered a case u/ss. 3 and 4 of PMLA against the accused persons – High Court dismissed the application for grant of anticipatory bail filed by the appellant – On appeal, held: Power u/s.438 Cr.P.C. is an extraordinary power and the same has to be exercised sparingly more so, in cases of economic offences – Economic offences stand as a different class as they effect the economic fabric of the society – Grant of anticipatory bail at the stage of investigation may frustrate the investigating agency in interrogating the accused and in collecting the useful information and also the materials which might have been concealed – Success is such interrogation would elude if the accused knows that he is protected by the order of the Court – In the instant case, having regard to the materials collected by the respondent- Enforcement Directorate and considering the stage of investigation, it was not a fit case to grant anticipatory bail. Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 – s.438 – Constitution of India – Art. 21 – Right of anticipatory bail, a part of Art.21 of the Constitution of India or not – Held: The legislative intent behind the introduction of s.438 Cr.P.C. is to safeguard the individual’s personal liberty and to protect him from the possibility of being humiliated and from being subjected to unnecessary police custody. However, the court must also keep in view that a criminal offence is not just an offence against an individual, rather the larger societal interest is at stake – Therefore, a delicate balance is required to be established between the two rights-safeguarding the personal liberty of an individual and the societal interest – It cannot be said that refusal to grant anticipatory bail would amount to denial of the rights conferred upon the appellant u/Art. 21 of the Constitution of India. Words and Phrases – ‘reason to believe’ – Held: As per definition in s.26 IPC, a person is said to be have ‘reason to believe’ a thing, if he has sufficient cause to believe that thing but not otherwise – The specified officer must have ‘reason to believe’ on the basis of material in his possession that the property sought to be attached is likely to be concealed, transferred on dealt with in a manner which may result in frustrating any proceedings for confiscation of their property under the Prevention of Money - Laundering Act, 2002. Words and Phrases – Economic offence – discussed.",

Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 – ss.3 and 4 – Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988 – s.8 and 13(2) – r/w. s.13(1)(d) – Interrogation of the accused – Interferences of Judiciary in – Held: Interrogation of the accused and the answers elicited from the accused and the opinion whether the answers given by the accused are ‘satisfactory’ or ‘evasive’, is purely within the domain of the investigating agency and the Court cannot substitute its views by conducting mini trial at various stages of investigation. Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 – ss.3 and 4 – Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 – s.438 – Grant of anticipatory bail – Prosecution alleged irregularities in Foreign Investment Promotion Board (FIPB) clearance given to a company for receiving foreign investment to the tune of Rs.305 crores against approved inflow of Rs.4.62 crores – Appellant was the then finance minister – FIR was registered – Enforcement Directorate also registered a case u/ss. 3 and 4 of PMLA against the accused persons – High Court dismissed the application for grant of anticipatory bail filed by the appellant – On appeal, held: Power u/s.438 Cr.P.C. is an extraordinary power and the same has to be exercised sparingly more so, in cases of economic offences – Economic offences stand as a different class as they effect the economic fabric of the society – Grant of anticipatory bail at the stage of investigation may frustrate the investigating agency in interrogating the accused and in collecting the useful information and also the materials which might have been concealed – Success is such interrogation would elude if the accused knows that he is protected by the order of the Court – In the instant case, having regard to the materials collected by the respondent- Enforcement Directorate and considering the stage of investigation, it was not a fit case to grant anticipatory bail. Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 – s.438 – Constitution of India – Art. 21 – Right of anticipatory bail, a part of Art.21 of the Constitution of India or not – Held: The legislative intent behind the introduction of s.438 Cr.P.C. is to safeguard the individual’s personal liberty and to protect him from the possibility of being humiliated and from being subjected to unnecessary police custody. However, the court must also keep in view that a criminal offence is not just an offence against an individual, rather the larger societal interest is at stake – Therefore, a delicate balance is required to be established between the two rights-safeguarding the personal liberty of an individual and the societal interest – It cannot be said that refusal to grant anticipatory bail would amount to denial of the rights conferred upon the appellant u/Art. 21 of the Constitution of India. Words and Phrases – ‘reason to believe’ – Held: As per definition in s.26 IPC, a person is said to be have ‘reason to believe’ a thing, if he has sufficient cause to believe that thing but not otherwise – The specified officer must have ‘reason to believe’ on the basis of material in his possession that the property sought to be attached is likely to be concealed, transferred on dealt with in a manner which may result in frustrating any proceedings for confiscation of their property under the Prevention of Money - Laundering Act, 2002.

        "HeadNote": "Service Law: Selection process – Reservation policy – Post of Technical Assistant – Appellants as well as private respondents applied for and appeared in the written examination held in 2014 – As per U.P. Reservation Act, specific percentages of vacancies were reserved for different categories – It was brought to notice of State Government that there was wrongful calculation of category-wise vacancies in the earlier requisition and, therefore, the earlier requisition was required to be revised – State Government by order dated 20.08.2014, re-worked the vacancies for different categories of persons and sent the revised requisition for the vacancies for different categories to UP Public Service Commission (UPPSC) after adjustment of diploma holders against ‘general category’ – Based on revised requisition, UPPSC declared the result of written examination, wherein appellants as well as private respondents were declared successful – Thereafter, UPPSC issued O.M. dated 12.10.2014 specifically mentioning the number of vacancies to be filled up in various categories in consonance with order dated 20.07.2014 – Successful candidates appeared in interview on 27.10.2014 and finally result of select list candidates was declared on 21.05.2015 – Private respondents did not qualify – Unsuccessful candidates filed writ petitions before High Court challenging the validity of O.M. 12.10.2014 and the result declared on 21.05.2015 and praying for quashing the same and for preparation of result afresh without giving effect to O.M. 12.10.2014 – The impugned result was also assailed on the ground that it contravened s.3(1) of UP Reservation Act, 1994 and r.15(3) of UP Subordinate Agriculture Services Rules, 1993 and also that the percentage of reservation to SC/ST and OBC categories crossed the upper limit of 50% – Held: Revised requisition dated 20.8.2014 and OM dated 12.10.2014 was valid since it was only intended to rectify wrongful calculation of number of vacancies in different categories and to comply with requisite percentage of quota of reservation in different categories as per 1994 Act – By virtue of r.15 and r.6 of UP Subordinate Agriculture Services Rules, 1993 (Agriculture Service Rules, 1993), the Recruitment Authority is empowered to rectify the wrongful calculation and make a revised requisition of number of vacancies in different categories which is in accordance with the provisions of UP Reservation Act, 1994 – High Court was not right in saying that the diploma holders ought not to have been absorbed against the “General category” so as to alter the advertised number of posts against the “General category” – Absorption of diploma holders were required to be done only against the “General quota” – Revising the number of vacancies in different categories to satisfy reservation quota scheme as per UP Reservation Act, 1994 would not amount to changing the rules of the game after the commencement of the selection process – Having participated in the interview and when they failed in the final selection, it was not open to the private respondents/intervenors to turn around and challenge the revised notification dated 12.10.2014 and the final select list dated 21.05.2015 – The filling up of the unfilled horizontal reservation by the candidates from the respective vertical reservation is in accordance with the policy of the government and the same cannot be faulted with – Uttar Pradesh Public Services (Reservation for Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and Other Backward Classes) Act, 1994. Service law: Selection process – Reservation scheme – Appointment letter not issued to 906 candidates – Plea to exercise power under Art.142 of the Constitution of India – The 906 candidates were not issued the appointment orders in order to keep the appointment within the permissible percentage of reservation as per UP Reservation Act, 1994 – These 906 candidates who were left out and were not issued appointment orders were ranked lower in the merit list than the last selected candidate in their respective category under the reservation limit as identified by the Personnel Department, therefore appointment orders were not issued to them – This cannot be said to be arbitrariness or discrimination as selection of candidates was on the basis of the merit list – Therefore, power under Art.142 of the Constitution of India cannot be exercised to issue direction to the State to issue appointment orders to 906 candidates – Constitution of India – Art.142. Service law: Selection process – It is a settled law that a person having consciously participated in the interview cannot turn around and challenge the selection process – Having appeared in the interview without any demur or protest, it is not open to the candidates to challenge the selection process on the ground that there was modification in the number of vacancies in different categories and they are estopped by the principle of estoppel from challenging the same – Doctrine of estoppel. Service law: Selection process – It is fairly well-settled that the selected candidates do not have any indefeasible right to be appointed – Merely because the names of candidates were included in the provisional select list, they do not acquire any indefeasible right to be appointed. Doctrines/Principles: Doctrine of res judicata – Batch of writ petitions disposed of by High Court by common judgment containing common operative portion of judgment – Appeal filed in few writ petitions – Decision of Supreme Court – Whether judgment rendered in other writ petitions by High Court having not been challenged, have attained finality and operate as res judicata – Held: The decision of Supreme Court is binding on all the writ petitioners before High Court even though they were not parties in the appeal before the Supreme Court.",

        "HeadNote": "Service Law: Selection process – Reservation policy – Post of Technical Assistant – Appellants as well as private respondents applied for and appeared in the written examination held in 2014 – As per U.P. Reservation Act, specific percentages of vacancies were reserved for different categories – It was brought to notice of State Government that there was wrongful calculation of category-wise vacancies in the earlier requisition and, therefore, the earlier requisition was required to be revised – State Government by order dated 20.08.2014, re-worked the vacancies for different categories of persons and sent the revised requisition for the vacancies for different categories to UP Public Service Commission (UPPSC) after adjustment of diploma holders against ‘general category’ – Based on revised requisition, UPPSC declared the result of written examination, wherein appellants as well as private respondents were declared successful – Thereafter, UPPSC issued O.M. dated 12.10.2014 specifically mentioning the number of vacancies to be filled up in various categories in consonance with order dated 20.07.2014 – Successful candidates appeared in interview on 27.10.2014 and finally result of select list candidates was declared on 21.05.2015 – Private respondents did not qualify – Unsuccessful candidates filed writ petitions before High Court challenging the validity of O.M. 12.10.2014 and the result declared on 21.05.2015 and praying for quashing the same and for preparation of result afresh without giving effect to O.M. 12.10.2014 – The impugned result was also assailed on the ground that it contravened s.3(1) of UP Reservation Act, 1994 and r.15(3) of UP Subordinate Agriculture Services Rules, 1993 and also that the percentage of reservation to SC/ST and OBC categories crossed the upper limit of 50% – Held: Revised requisition dated 20.8.2014 and OM dated 12.10.2014 was valid since it was only intended to rectify wrongful calculation of number of vacancies in different categories and to comply with requisite percentage of quota of reservation in different categories as per 1994 Act – By virtue of r.15 and r.6 of UP Subordinate Agriculture Services Rules, 1993 (Agriculture Service Rules, 1993), the Recruitment Authority is empowered to rectify the wrongful calculation and make a revised requisition of number of vacancies in different categories which is in accordance with the provisions of UP Reservation Act, 1994 – High Court was not right in saying that the diploma holders ought not to have been absorbed against the “General category” so as to alter the advertised number of posts against the “General category” – Absorption of diploma holders were required to be done only against the “General quota” – Revising the number of vacancies in different categories to satisfy reservation quota scheme as per UP Reservation Act, 1994 would not amount to changing the rules of the game after the commencement of the selection process – Having participated in the interview and when they failed in the final selection, it was not open to the private respondents/intervenors to turn around and challenge the revised notification dated 12.10.2014 and the final select list dated 21.05.2015 – The filling up of the unfilled horizontal reservation by the candidates from the respective vertical reservation is in accordance with the policy of the government and the same cannot be faulted with – Uttar Pradesh Public Services (Reservation for Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and Other Backward Classes) Act, 1994. Service law: Selection process – Reservation scheme – Appointment letter not issued to 906 candidates – Plea to exercise power under Art.142 of the Constitution of India – The 906 candidates were not issued the appointment orders in order to keep the appointment within the permissible percentage of reservation as per UP Reservation Act, 1994 – These 906 candidates who were left out and were not issued appointment orders were ranked lower in the merit list than the last selected candidate in their respective category under the reservation limit as identified by the Personnel Department, therefore appointment orders were not issued to them – This cannot be said to be arbitrariness or discrimination as selection of candidates was on the basis of the merit list – Therefore, power under Art.142 of the Constitution of India cannot be exercised to issue direction to the State to issue appointment orders to 906 candidates – Constitution of India – Art.142. Service law: Selection process – It is a settled law that a person having consciously participated in the interview cannot turn around and challenge the selection process – Having appeared in the interview without any demur or protest, it is not open to the candidates to challenge the selection process on the ground that there was modification in the number of vacancies in different categories and they are estopped by the principle of estoppel from challenging the same – Doctrine of estoppel. Service law: Selection process – It is fairly well-settled that the selected candidates do not have any indefeasible right to be appointed – Merely because the names of candidates were included in the provisional select list, they do not acquire any indefeasible right to be appointed. Doctrines/Principles: Doctrine of res judicata – Batch of writ petitions disposed of by High Court by common judgment containing common operative portion of judgment – Appeal filed in few writ petitions – Decision of Supreme Court – Whether judgment rendered in other writ petitions by High Court having not been challenged, have attained finality and operate as res judicata – Held: The decision of Supreme Court is binding on all the writ petitioners before High Court even though they were not parties in the appeal before the Supreme Court.",

        "HeadNote": "Service Law: Selection process – Reservation policy – Post of Technical Assistant – Appellants as well as private respondents applied for and appeared in the written examination held in 2014 – As per U.P. Reservation Act, specific percentages of vacancies were reserved for different categories – It was brought to notice of State Government that there was wrongful calculation of category-wise vacancies in the earlier requisition and, therefore, the earlier requisition was required to be revised – State Government by order dated 20.08.2014, re-worked the vacancies for different categories of persons and sent the revised requisition for the vacancies for different categories to UP Public Service Commission (UPPSC) after adjustment of diploma holders against ‘general category’ – Based on revised requisition, UPPSC declared the result of written examination, wherein appellants as well as private respondents were declared successful – Thereafter, UPPSC issued O.M. dated 12.10.2014 specifically mentioning the number of vacancies to be filled up in various categories in consonance with order dated 20.07.2014 – Successful candidates appeared in interview on 27.10.2014 and finally result of select list candidates was declared on 21.05.2015 – Private respondents did not qualify – Unsuccessful candidates filed writ petitions before High Court challenging the validity of O.M. 12.10.2014 and the result declared on 21.05.2015 and praying for quashing the same and for preparation of result afresh without giving effect to O.M. 12.10.2014 – The impugned result was also assailed on the ground that it contravened s.3(1) of UP Reservation Act, 1994 and r.15(3) of UP Subordinate Agriculture Services Rules, 1993 and also that the percentage of reservation to SC/ST and OBC categories crossed the upper limit of 50% – Held: Revised requisition dated 20.8.2014 and OM dated 12.10.2014 was valid since it was only intended to rectify wrongful calculation of number of vacancies in different categories and to comply with requisite percentage of quota of reservation in different categories as per 1994 Act – By virtue of r.15 and r.6 of UP Subordinate Agriculture Services Rules, 1993 (Agriculture Service Rules, 1993), the Recruitment Authority is empowered to rectify the wrongful calculation and make a revised requisition of number of vacancies in different categories which is in accordance with the provisions of UP Reservation Act, 1994 – High Court was not right in saying that the diploma holders ought not to have been absorbed against the “General category” so as to alter the advertised number of posts against the “General category” – Absorption of diploma holders were required to be done only against the “General quota” – Revising the number of vacancies in different categories to satisfy reservation quota scheme as per UP Reservation Act, 1994 would not amount to changing the rules of the game after the commencement of the selection process – Having participated in the interview and when they failed in the final selection, it was not open to the private respondents/intervenors to turn around and challenge the revised notification dated 12.10.2014 and the final select list dated 21.05.2015 – The filling up of the unfilled horizontal reservation by the candidates from the respective vertical reservation is in accordance with the policy of the government and the same cannot be faulted with – Uttar Pradesh Public Services (Reservation for Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and Other Backward Classes) Act, 1994. Service law: Selection process – Reservation scheme – Appointment letter not issued to 906 candidates – Plea to exercise power under Art.142 of the Constitution of India – The 906 candidates were not issued the appointment orders in order to keep the appointment within the permissible percentage of reservation as per UP Reservation Act, 1994 – These 906 candidates who were left out and were not issued appointment orders were ranked lower in the merit list than the last selected candidate in their respective category under the reservation limit as identified by the Personnel Department, therefore appointment orders were not issued to them – This cannot be said to be arbitrariness or discrimination as selection of candidates was on the basis of the merit list – Therefore, power under Art.142 of the Constitution of India cannot be exercised to issue direction to the State to issue appointment orders to 906 candidates – Constitution of India – Art.142. Service law: Selection process – It is a settled law that a person having consciously participated in the interview cannot turn around and challenge the selection process – Having appeared in the interview without any demur or protest, it is not open to the candidates to challenge the selection process on the ground that there was modification in the number of vacancies in different categories and they are estopped by the principle of estoppel from challenging the same – Doctrine of estoppel. Service law: Selection process – It is fairly well-settled that the selected candidates do not have any indefeasible right to be appointed – Merely because the names of candidates were included in the provisional select list, they do not acquire any indefeasible right to be appointed. Doctrines/Principles: Doctrine of res judicata – Batch of writ petitions disposed of by High Court by common judgment containing common operative portion of judgment – Appeal filed in few writ petitions – Decision of Supreme Court – Whether judgment rendered in other writ petitions by High Court having not been challenged, have attained finality and operate as res judicata – Held: The decision of Supreme Court is binding on all the writ petitioners before High Court even though they were not parties in the appeal before the Supreme Court.",

        "HeadNote": "Service Law: Selection process – Reservation policy – Post of Technical Assistant – Appellants as well as private respondents applied for and appeared in the written examination held in 2014 – As per U.P. Reservation Act, specific percentages of vacancies were reserved for different categories – It was brought to notice of State Government that there was wrongful calculation of category-wise vacancies in the earlier requisition and, therefore, the earlier requisition was required to be revised – State Government by order dated 20.08.2014, re-worked the vacancies for different categories of persons and sent the revised requisition for the vacancies for different categories to UP Public Service Commission (UPPSC) after adjustment of diploma holders against ‘general category’ – Based on revised requisition, UPPSC declared the result of written examination, wherein appellants as well as private respondents were declared successful – Thereafter, UPPSC issued O.M. dated 12.10.2014 specifically mentioning the number of vacancies to be filled up in various categories in consonance with order dated 20.07.2014 – Successful candidates appeared in interview on 27.10.2014 and finally result of select list candidates was declared on 21.05.2015 – Private respondents did not qualify – Unsuccessful candidates filed writ petitions before High Court challenging the validity of O.M. 12.10.2014 and the result declared on 21.05.2015 and praying for quashing the same and for preparation of result afresh without giving effect to O.M. 12.10.2014 – The impugned result was also assailed on the ground that it contravened s.3(1) of UP Reservation Act, 1994 and r.15(3) of UP Subordinate Agriculture Services Rules, 1993 and also that the percentage of reservation to SC/ST and OBC categories crossed the upper limit of 50% – Held: Revised requisition dated 20.8.2014 and OM dated 12.10.2014 was valid since it was only intended to rectify wrongful calculation of number of vacancies in different categories and to comply with requisite percentage of quota of reservation in different categories as per 1994 Act – By virtue of r.15 and r.6 of UP Subordinate Agriculture Services Rules, 1993 (Agriculture Service Rules, 1993), the Recruitment Authority is empowered to rectify the wrongful calculation and make a revised requisition of number of vacancies in different categories which is in accordance with the provisions of UP Reservation Act, 1994 – High Court was not right in saying that the diploma holders ought not to have been absorbed against the “General category” so as to alter the advertised number of posts against the “General category” – Absorption of diploma holders were required to be done only against the “General quota” – Revising the number of vacancies in different categories to satisfy reservation quota scheme as per UP Reservation Act, 1994 would not amount to changing the rules of the game after the commencement of the selection process – Having participated in the interview and when they failed in the final selection, it was not open to the private respondents/intervenors to turn around and challenge the revised notification dated 12.10.2014 and the final select list dated 21.05.2015 – The filling up of the unfilled horizontal reservation by the candidates from the respective vertical reservation is in accordance with the policy of the government and the same cannot be faulted with – Uttar Pradesh Public Services (Reservation for Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and Other Backward Classes) Act, 1994. Service law: Selection process – Reservation scheme – Appointment letter not issued to 906 candidates – Plea to exercise power under Art.142 of the Constitution of India – The 906 candidates were not issued the appointment orders in order to keep the appointment within the permissible percentage of reservation as per UP Reservation Act, 1994 – These 906 candidates who were left out and were not issued appointment orders were ranked lower in the merit list than the last selected candidate in their respective category under the reservation limit as identified by the Personnel Department, therefore appointment orders were not issued to them – This cannot be said to be arbitrariness or discrimination as selection of candidates was on the basis of the merit list – Therefore, power under Art.142 of the Constitution of India cannot be exercised to issue direction to the State to issue appointment orders to 906 candidates – Constitution of India – Art.142. Service law: Selection process – It is a settled law that a person having consciously participated in the interview cannot turn around and challenge the selection process – Having appeared in the interview without any demur or protest, it is not open to the candidates to challenge the selection process on the ground that there was modification in the number of vacancies in different categories and they are estopped by the principle of estoppel from challenging the same – Doctrine of estoppel. Service law: Selection process – It is fairly well-settled that the selected candidates do not have any indefeasible right to be appointed – Merely because the names of candidates were included in the provisional select list, they do not acquire any indefeasible right to be appointed. Doctrines/Principles: Doctrine of res judicata – Batch of writ petitions disposed of by High Court by common judgment containing common operative portion of judgment – Appeal filed in few writ petitions – Decision of Supreme Court – Whether judgment rendered in other writ petitions by High Court having not been challenged, have attained finality and operate as res judicata – Held: The decision of Supreme Court is binding on all the writ petitioners before High Court even though they were not parties in the appeal before the Supreme Court.",

Constitution of India: Art.14 – Notifications issued by the State Governments imposing a condition of compulsory service and a default clause – Reasonableness of – Held: Notifications imposing a condition of compulsory service and a default clause are per se not unreasonable – However, the period of compulsory service and the exit should be reasonable – State Governments and Armed Forces Medical College are directed to consider imposing the condition of compulsory service period of two years in default of which the Doctors would recompense the Government by paying Rs. 20 Lakhs. Constitution of India: Arts.19(1)(g), 19(6) – Right to life and liberty – Right to take decisions relating to profession – According to the Appellants, the right to carry on their profession guaranteed by Art.19(1)(g) is violated by the compulsory bonds and that any restriction on their right to carry on their profession by the State Government can be made only by a “law” as per Art. 19(6) of the Constitution – Held: The compulsory bond executed by the Appellants is at the time of their admissions into post-graduate and super speciality courses – Conditions imposed for admission to a medical college will not directly violate the right of an individual to carry on his profession – The right to carry on the profession would start on the completion of the course – At the outset, there is no doubt that no right inheres in an individual to receive higher education – Violation of a right guaranteed under Art.19(1)(g) does not arise in a case pertaining to admission to a college – The condition that is imposed has a connection with the professional activity of a doctor on completion of the course – However, the Appellants have, without any protest, accepted the admissions and executed the compulsory bonds – Appellants have not succeeded in their attempt of assailing the Notifications for being violative of Art.19(1)(g) of the Constitution. Constitution of India: Arts.21, 47 – Right to life – Art.21 imposes an obligation on the State to safeguard the right to life of every person – Preservation of human life is thus of paramount importance – The Government hospitals run by the State and the Medical Officers employed therein are duty bound to extend medical assistance for preserving human life – In a welfare State, it is the obligation of the State to ensure the creation and the sustaining of conditions congenial to good health – Art.47 reiterates the constitutional obligation imposed on the State to improve public health. Constitution of India: Art.21 – Right to live with dignity – Right to life enshrined in Art.21 cannot be restricted to mere animal existence – It means something much more than just physical survival – The right to life includes the right to live with human dignity and all that goes along with it, namely, the bare necessaries of life such as adequate nutrition, clothing and shelter, and facilities for reading, writing and expressing oneself in diverse forms, freely moving about and mixing and commingling with fellow human beings – Dignity is the core which unites the fundamental rights because the fundamental rights seek to achieve for each individual the dignity of existence – The State’s obligations are not satisfied solely by refraining from imposing limitations on the right to human dignity – State must also take action to protect human dignity and to facilitate its realization – The constitutional right to dignity is intended to ensure human beings’ political and civil liberties as well as their social and economic freedoms. Constitution of India: Art.23 – Whether the conditions of the bond per se amount to ‘forced labour’ and thus violative of Art.23(1) – Appellants who are required to work for a short period on a decent stipend cannot complain that they are made to perform ‘forced labour’, especially after they took an informed decision to avail the benefits of admission in government medical colleges and received subsidized education – By no means, the service rendered by the Appellants in Government hospitals would fall under the expression of ‘forced labour’ – Art.23(2) enables the State Governments to require the Appellants to do compulsory service in the Government hospitals which is undoubtedly for the benefit of the public. Constitution of India: Art.47 – Right to health is integral to the right to life – Government has a constitutional obligation to provide health facilities – Art.47 reiterates the constitutional obligation imposed on the State to improve public health – It is for the State to secure health to its citizens as its primary duty – No doubt, the Government is rendering this obligation by opening Government hospitals and health centers, but in order to make it meaningful, it has to be within the reach of its people, as far as possible, to reduce the queue of waiting lists, and it has to provide all facilities to employ best of talents and tone up its administration to give effective contribution, which is also the duty of the Government – The immediate need of the deprived sections of the society to have proper health care is the reason behind the Government policy of imposing a condition of compulsory service and a default clause – The objective of the policy is to ensure that specialist health care is extended to the have-nots also – The right that is claimed by the Appellants is to make an individual choice to carry on their profession which might be hindered by the policy decision of the Government – On the other hand, the basic idea behind the Government’s decision is larger public interest – Right to life guaranteed by Art.21 means right to life with human dignity – While balancing communitarian dignity vis-à-vis the dignity of private individuals, the scales must tilt in favour of communitarian dignity – The laudable objective with which the State Governments have introduced compulsory service bonds is to protect the fundamental right of the deprived sections of the society guaranteed to them under Art.21 – The contention of the Appellants that their rights guaranteed under Art.21 have been violated is rejected. Specific Relief Act, 1963: s.14 – Contract of Personal Service – Prohibition of specific performance of contract for personal service – Held: s.14 of the Specific Relief Act prohibits the enforcement of contracts of personal service – It is trite law that Courts do not ordinarily enforce performance of contracts of personal character, such as a contract of employment – None of the State Governments made an attempt to enforce the contracts entered into by them with the appellants through the service bonds – Constitution of India. Contract Act, 1872: s.27 – Restraint on Profession – Plea of the Appellants that compulsory bonds placed a restraint on their profession and thus, would be contrary to s.27 of the Contract Act – Held: A contract entered into by Appellants to serve the government for a few years under reasonable terms cannot be described as one in restraint of trade – The conditions of compulsory bonds for admission to post-graduate and super-Speciality courses in government medical colleges are not in violation of s.27 of the Contract Act – All the Doctors who have executed compulsory bonds shall be bound by the conditions contained therein – Taking note of the fact that certain State Governments have rigid conditions in the compulsory bonds to be executed by the Appellants and the felt need of uniformity in the matter pertaining to the compulsory bonds, suitable steps should be taken by the Union of India and the Medical Council of India to have a uniform policy regarding the compulsory service to be rendered by the Doctors who are trained in government institutions – Constitution of India.",

        "HeadNote": "Constitution of India: Art.162; Seventh Schedule, List I, Entries 63 to 66; List III Entry 25 – Jurisdiction of the State Government – Notification issued by State Government for compulsory execution of bond by the candidates at the time of admission to post-graduate courses and super speciality courses providing that they shall serve the State Government for certain stipulated period on successful completion of courses failing which they would be liable to recompense the State Government – Competence of State Government to issue such notification – Held: Entry 66 of List I of the 7th Schedule to the Constitution refers to coordination and determination of standards in institutions for higher education or research and scientific and technical institutions – Entry 25 of List III of the 7th Schedule deals with education, including technical education, medical education and universities, subject to the provisions of entries 63, 64, 65 and 66 of List I – Legislations can be made by the State Legislature relating to medical education subject to the legislation made by the Parliament – The Medical Council of India Act governs the field of medical education in this country – Admittedly, there is no provision in the Medical Council of India Act touching upon the subject matter of compulsory bonds – Therefore, the States are free to legislate on the subject matter of medical bonds – Executive authority of the State Government is co\u0002extensive with that of the legislative power of the State Legislature – Even in the absence of any legislation, the State Government has the competence to issue executive orders under Art.162 on matters over which the State legislature has the power to legislate – Thus, Notifications issued by the State Governments imposing a condition of execution of compulsory bonds at the time of admission to post\u0002graduate courses and super speciality courses cannot be said to be vitiated due to lack of authority or competence – Medical Council of India Act. Constitution of India: Art.14 – Notification issued by State Government for compulsory execution of bond at the time of admission of candidates to post-graduate courses and super specialty courses providing that they shall serve the State Government for certain stipulated period on successful completion of courses failing which they will be liable to recompense the State Government – Whether violated fundamental rights and is arbitrary – Held: Running medical colleges with post-graduate and super speciality courses requires huge infrastructure – However, the amount of fees charged from the students is meagre in comparison to the private medical colleges – The doctors are to paid reasonable stipend – Government hospitals run by the State are duty bound to extend medical assistance for preserving human life – Failure on the part of a Government hospital to provide timely medical treatment to a person in need of such treatment results in violation of his right guaranteed under Art.21 of the Constitution – Consequently, a policy decision taken by the State Governments to utilize the services of doctors who were beneficiaries of Government assistance to complete their education cannot be termed arbitrary. Constitution of India: Art.14 – Notifications issued by the State Governments imposing a condition of compulsory service and a default clause – Reasonableness of – Held: Notifications imposing a condition of compulsory service and a default clause are per se not unreasonable – However, the period of compulsory service and the exit should be reasonable – State Governments and Armed Forces Medical College are directed to consider imposing the condition of compulsory service period of two years in default of which the Doctors would recompense the Government by paying Rs. 20 Lakhs. Constitution of India: Arts.19(1)(g), 19(6) – Right to life and liberty – Right to take decisions relating to profession – According to the Appellants, the right to carry on their profession guaranteed by Art.19(1)(g) is violated by the compulsory bonds and that any restriction on their right to carry on their profession by the State Government can be made only by a “law” as per Art. 19(6) of the Constitution – Held: The compulsory bond executed by the Appellants is at the time of their admissions into post-graduate and super speciality courses – Conditions imposed for admission to a medical college will not directly violate the right of an individual to carry on his profession – The right to carry on the profession would start on the completion of the course – At the outset, there is no doubt that no right inheres in an individual to receive higher education – Violation of a right guaranteed under Art.19(1)(g) does not arise in a case pertaining to admission to a college – The condition that is imposed has a connection with the professional activity of a doctor on completion of the course – However, the Appellants have, without any protest, accepted the admissions and executed the compulsory bonds – Appellants have not succeeded in their attempt of assailing the Notifications for being violative of Art.19(1)(g) of the Constitution. Constitution of India: Arts.21, 47 – Right to life – Art.21 imposes an obligation on the State to safeguard the right to life of every person – Preservation of human life is thus of paramount importance – The Government hospitals run by the State and the Medical Officers employed therein are duty bound to extend medical assistance for preserving human life – In a welfare State, it is the obligation of the State to ensure the creation and the sustaining of conditions congenial to good health – Art.47 reiterates the constitutional obligation imposed on the State to improve public health. Constitution of India: Art.21 – Right to live with dignity – Right to life enshrined in Art.21 cannot be restricted to mere animal existence – It means something much more than just physical survival – The right to life includes the right to live with human dignity and all that goes along with it, namely, the bare necessaries of life such as adequate nutrition, clothing and shelter, and facilities for reading, writing and expressing oneself in diverse forms, freely moving about and mixing and commingling with fellow human beings – Dignity is the core which unites the fundamental rights because the fundamental rights seek to achieve for each individual the dignity of existence – The State’s obligations are not satisfied solely by refraining from imposing limitations on the right to human dignity – State must also take action to protect human dignity and to facilitate its realization – The constitutional right to dignity is intended to ensure human beings’ political and civil liberties as well as their social and economic freedoms. Constitution of India: Art.23 – Whether the conditions of the bond per se amount to ‘forced labour’ and thus violative of Art.23(1) – Appellants who are required to work for a short period on a decent stipend cannot complain that they are made to perform ‘forced labour’, especially after they took an informed decision to avail the benefits of admission in government medical colleges and received subsidized education – By no means, the service rendered by the Appellants in Government hospitals would fall under the expression of ‘forced labour’ – Art.23(2) enables the State Governments to require the Appellants to do compulsory service in the Government hospitals which is undoubtedly for the benefit of the public. Constitution of India: Art.47 – Right to health is integral to the right to life – Government has a constitutional obligation to provide health facilities – Art.47 reiterates the constitutional obligation imposed on the State to improve public health – It is for the State to secure health to its citizens as its primary duty – No doubt, the Government is rendering this obligation by opening Government hospitals and health centers, but in order to make it meaningful, it has to be within the reach of its people, as far as possible, to reduce the queue of waiting lists, and it has to provide all facilities to employ best of talents and tone up its administration to give effective contribution, which is also the duty of the Government – The immediate need of the deprived sections of the society to have proper health care is the reason behind the Government policy of imposing a condition of compulsory service and a default clause – The objective of the policy is to ensure that specialist health care is extended to the have-nots also – The right that is claimed by the Appellants is to make an individual choice to carry on their profession which might be hindered by the policy decision of the Government – On the other hand, the basic idea behind the Government’s decision is larger public interest – Right to life guaranteed by Art.21 means right to life with human dignity – While balancing communitarian dignity vis-à-vis the dignity of private individuals, the scales must tilt in favour of communitarian dignity – The laudable objective with which the State Governments have introduced compulsory service bonds is to protect the fundamental right of the deprived sections of the society guaranteed to them under Art.21 – The contention of the Appellants that their rights guaranteed under Art.21 have been violated is rejected. Specific Relief Act, 1963: s.14 – Contract of Personal Service – Prohibition of specific performance of contract for personal service – Held: s.14 of the Specific Relief Act prohibits the enforcement of contracts of personal service – It is trite law that Courts do not ordinarily enforce performance of contracts of personal character, such as a contract of employment – None of the State Governments made an attempt to enforce the contracts entered into by them with the appellants through the service bonds – Constitution of India. Contract Act, 1872: s.27 – Restraint on Profession – Plea of the Appellants that compulsory bonds placed a restraint on their profession and thus, would be contrary to s.27 of the Contract Act – Held: A contract entered into by Appellants to serve the government for a few years under reasonable terms cannot be described as one in restraint of trade – The conditions of compulsory bonds for admission to post-graduate and super-Speciality courses in government medical colleges are not in violation of s.27 of the Contract Act – All the Doctors who have executed compulsory bonds shall be bound by the conditions contained therein – Taking note of the fact that certain State Governments have rigid conditions in the compulsory bonds to be executed by the Appellants and the felt need of uniformity in the matter pertaining to the compulsory bonds, suitable steps should be taken by the Union of India and the Medical Council of India to have a uniform policy regarding the compulsory service to be rendered by the Doctors who are trained in government institutions – Constitution of India.",

        "HeadNote": "Constitution of India: Art.162; Seventh Schedule, List I, Entries 63 to 66; List III Entry 25 – Jurisdiction of the State Government – Notification issued by State Government for compulsory execution of bond by the candidates at the time of admission to post-graduate courses and super speciality courses providing that they shall serve the State Government for certain stipulated period on successful completion of courses failing which they would be liable to recompense the State Government – Competence of State Government to issue such notification – Held: Entry 66 of List I of the 7th Schedule to the Constitution refers to coordination and determination of standards in institutions for higher education or research and scientific and technical institutions – Entry 25 of List III of the 7th Schedule deals with education, including technical education, medical education and universities, subject to the provisions of entries 63, 64, 65 and 66 of List I – Legislations can be made by the State Legislature relating to medical education subject to the legislation made by the Parliament – The Medical Council of India Act governs the field of medical education in this country – Admittedly, there is no provision in the Medical Council of India Act touching upon the subject matter of compulsory bonds – Therefore, the States are free to legislate on the subject matter of medical bonds – Executive authority of the State Government is co\u0002extensive with that of the legislative power of the State Legislature – Even in the absence of any legislation, the State Government has the competence to issue executive orders under Art.162 on matters over which the State legislature has the power to legislate – Thus, Notifications issued by the State Governments imposing a condition of execution of compulsory bonds at the time of admission to post\u0002graduate courses and super speciality courses cannot be said to be vitiated due to lack of authority or competence – Medical Council of India Act. Constitution of India: Art.14 – Notification issued by State Government for compulsory execution of bond at the time of admission of candidates to post-graduate courses and super specialty courses providing that they shall serve the State Government for certain stipulated period on successful completion of courses failing which they will be liable to recompense the State Government – Whether violated fundamental rights and is arbitrary – Held: Running medical colleges with post-graduate and super speciality courses requires huge infrastructure – However, the amount of fees charged from the students is meagre in comparison to the private medical colleges – The doctors are to paid reasonable stipend – Government hospitals run by the State are duty bound to extend medical assistance for preserving human life – Failure on the part of a Government hospital to provide timely medical treatment to a person in need of such treatment results in violation of his right guaranteed under Art.21 of the Constitution – Consequently, a policy decision taken by the State Governments to utilize the services of doctors who were beneficiaries of Government assistance to complete their education cannot be termed arbitrary. Constitution of India: Art.14 – Notifications issued by the State Governments imposing a condition of compulsory service and a default clause – Reasonableness of – Held: Notifications imposing a condition of compulsory service and a default clause are per se not unreasonable – However, the period of compulsory service and the exit should be reasonable – State Governments and Armed Forces Medical College are directed to consider imposing the condition of compulsory service period of two years in default of which the Doctors would recompense the Government by paying Rs. 20 Lakhs. Constitution of India: Arts.19(1)(g), 19(6) – Right to life and liberty – Right to take decisions relating to profession – According to the Appellants, the right to carry on their profession guaranteed by Art.19(1)(g) is violated by the compulsory bonds and that any restriction on their right to carry on their profession by the State Government can be made only by a “law” as per Art. 19(6) of the Constitution – Held: The compulsory bond executed by the Appellants is at the time of their admissions into post-graduate and super speciality courses – Conditions imposed for admission to a medical college will not directly violate the right of an individual to carry on his profession – The right to carry on the profession would start on the completion of the course – At the outset, there is no doubt that no right inheres in an individual to receive higher education – Violation of a right guaranteed under Art.19(1)(g) does not arise in a case pertaining to admission to a college – The condition that is imposed has a connection with the professional activity of a doctor on completion of the course – However, the Appellants have, without any protest, accepted the admissions and executed the compulsory bonds – Appellants have not succeeded in their attempt of assailing the Notifications for being violative of Art.19(1)(g) of the Constitution. Constitution of India: Arts.21, 47 – Right to life – Art.21 imposes an obligation on the State to safeguard the right to life of every person – Preservation of human life is thus of paramount importance – The Government hospitals run by the State and the Medical Officers employed therein are duty bound to extend medical assistance for preserving human life – In a welfare State, it is the obligation of the State to ensure the creation and the sustaining of conditions congenial to good health – Art.47 reiterates the constitutional obligation imposed on the State to improve public health. Constitution of India: Art.21 – Right to live with dignity – Right to life enshrined in Art.21 cannot be restricted to mere animal existence – It means something much more than just physical survival – The right to life includes the right to live with human dignity and all that goes along with it, namely, the bare necessaries of life such as adequate nutrition, clothing and shelter, and facilities for reading, writing and expressing oneself in diverse forms, freely moving about and mixing and commingling with fellow human beings – Dignity is the core which unites the fundamental rights because the fundamental rights seek to achieve for each individual the dignity of existence – The State’s obligations are not satisfied solely by refraining from imposing limitations on the right to human dignity – State must also take action to protect human dignity and to facilitate its realization – The constitutional right to dignity is intended to ensure human beings’ political and civil liberties as well as their social and economic freedoms. Constitution of India: Art.23 – Whether the conditions of the bond per se amount to ‘forced labour’ and thus violative of Art.23(1) – Appellants who are required to work for a short period on a decent stipend cannot complain that they are made to perform ‘forced labour’, especially after they took an informed decision to avail the benefits of admission in government medical colleges and received subsidized education – By no means, the service rendered by the Appellants in Government hospitals would fall under the expression of ‘forced labour’ – Art.23(2) enables the State Governments to require the Appellants to do compulsory service in the Government hospitals which is undoubtedly for the benefit of the public. Constitution of India: Art.47 – Right to health is integral to the right to life – Government has a constitutional obligation to provide health facilities – Art.47 reiterates the constitutional obligation imposed on the State to improve public health – It is for the State to secure health to its citizens as its primary duty – No doubt, the Government is rendering this obligation by opening Government hospitals and health centers, but in order to make it meaningful, it has to be within the reach of its people, as far as possible, to reduce the queue of waiting lists, and it has to provide all facilities to employ best of talents and tone up its administration to give effective contribution, which is also the duty of the Government – The immediate need of the deprived sections of the society to have proper health care is the reason behind the Government policy of imposing a condition of compulsory service and a default clause – The objective of the policy is to ensure that specialist health care is extended to the have-nots also – The right that is claimed by the Appellants is to make an individual choice to carry on their profession which might be hindered by the policy decision of the Government – On the other hand, the basic idea behind the Government’s decision is larger public interest – Right to life guaranteed by Art.21 means right to life with human dignity – While balancing communitarian dignity vis-à-vis the dignity of private individuals, the scales must tilt in favour of communitarian dignity – The laudable objective with which the State Governments have introduced compulsory service bonds is to protect the fundamental right of the deprived sections of the society guaranteed to them under Art.21 – The contention of the Appellants that their rights guaranteed under Art.21 have been violated is rejected. Specific Relief Act, 1963: s.14 – Contract of Personal Service – Prohibition of specific performance of contract for personal service – Held: s.14 of the Specific Relief Act prohibits the enforcement of contracts of personal service – It is trite law that Courts do not ordinarily enforce performance of contracts of personal character, such as a contract of employment – None of the State Governments made an attempt to enforce the contracts entered into by them with the appellants through the service bonds – Constitution of India. Contract Act, 1872: s.27 – Restraint on Profession – Plea of the Appellants that compulsory bonds placed a restraint on their profession and thus, would be contrary to s.27 of the Contract Act – Held: A contract entered into by Appellants to serve the government for a few years under reasonable terms cannot be described as one in restraint of trade – The conditions of compulsory bonds for admission to post-graduate and super-Speciality courses in government medical colleges are not in violation of s.27 of the Contract Act – All the Doctors who have executed compulsory bonds shall be bound by the conditions contained therein – Taking note of the fact that certain State Governments have rigid conditions in the compulsory bonds to be executed by the Appellants and the felt need of uniformity in the matter pertaining to the compulsory bonds, suitable steps should be taken by the Union of India and the Medical Council of India to have a uniform policy regarding the compulsory service to be rendered by the Doctors who are trained in government institutions – Constitution of India.",

        "HeadNote": "Constitution of India: Art.162; Seventh Schedule, List I, Entries 63 to 66; List III Entry 25 – Jurisdiction of the State Government – Notification issued by State Government for compulsory execution of bond by the candidates at the time of admission to post-graduate courses and super speciality courses providing that they shall serve the State Government for certain stipulated period on successful completion of courses failing which they would be liable to recompense the State Government – Competence of State Government to issue such notification – Held: Entry 66 of List I of the 7th Schedule to the Constitution refers to coordination and determination of standards in institutions for higher education or research and scientific and technical institutions – Entry 25 of List III of the 7th Schedule deals with education, including technical education, medical education and universities, subject to the provisions of entries 63, 64, 65 and 66 of List I – Legislations can be made by the State Legislature relating to medical education subject to the legislation made by the Parliament – The Medical Council of India Act governs the field of medical education in this country – Admittedly, there is no provision in the Medical Council of India Act touching upon the subject matter of compulsory bonds – Therefore, the States are free to legislate on the subject matter of medical bonds – Executive authority of the State Government is co\u0002extensive with that of the legislative power of the State Legislature – Even in the absence of any legislation, the State Government has the competence to issue executive orders under Art.162 on matters over which the State legislature has the power to legislate – Thus, Notifications issued by the State Governments imposing a condition of execution of compulsory bonds at the time of admission to post\u0002graduate courses and super speciality courses cannot be said to be vitiated due to lack of authority or competence – Medical Council of India Act. Constitution of India: Art.14 – Notification issued by State Government for compulsory execution of bond at the time of admission of candidates to post-graduate courses and super specialty courses providing that they shall serve the State Government for certain stipulated period on successful completion of courses failing which they will be liable to recompense the State Government – Whether violated fundamental rights and is arbitrary – Held: Running medical colleges with post-graduate and super speciality courses requires huge infrastructure – However, the amount of fees charged from the students is meagre in comparison to the private medical colleges – The doctors are to paid reasonable stipend – Government hospitals run by the State are duty bound to extend medical assistance for preserving human life – Failure on the part of a Government hospital to provide timely medical treatment to a person in need of such treatment results in violation of his right guaranteed under Art.21 of the Constitution – Consequently, a policy decision taken by the State Governments to utilize the services of doctors who were beneficiaries of Government assistance to complete their education cannot be termed arbitrary. Constitution of India: Art.14 – Notifications issued by the State Governments imposing a condition of compulsory service and a default clause – Reasonableness of – Held: Notifications imposing a condition of compulsory service and a default clause are per se not unreasonable – However, the period of compulsory service and the exit should be reasonable – State Governments and Armed Forces Medical College are directed to consider imposing the condition of compulsory service period of two years in default of which the Doctors would recompense the Government by paying Rs. 20 Lakhs. Constitution of India: Arts.19(1)(g), 19(6) – Right to life and liberty – Right to take decisions relating to profession – According to the Appellants, the right to carry on their profession guaranteed by Art.19(1)(g) is violated by the compulsory bonds and that any restriction on their right to carry on their profession by the State Government can be made only by a “law” as per Art. 19(6) of the Constitution – Held: The compulsory bond executed by the Appellants is at the time of their admissions into post-graduate and super speciality courses – Conditions imposed for admission to a medical college will not directly violate the right of an individual to carry on his profession – The right to carry on the profession would start on the completion of the course – At the outset, there is no doubt that no right inheres in an individual to receive higher education – Violation of a right guaranteed under Art.19(1)(g) does not arise in a case pertaining to admission to a college – The condition that is imposed has a connection with the professional activity of a doctor on completion of the course – However, the Appellants have, without any protest, accepted the admissions and executed the compulsory bonds – Appellants have not succeeded in their attempt of assailing the Notifications for being violative of Art.19(1)(g) of the Constitution. Constitution of India: Arts.21, 47 – Right to life – Art.21 imposes an obligation on the State to safeguard the right to life of every person – Preservation of human life is thus of paramount importance – The Government hospitals run by the State and the Medical Officers employed therein are duty bound to extend medical assistance for preserving human life – In a welfare State, it is the obligation of the State to ensure the creation and the sustaining of conditions congenial to good health – Art.47 reiterates the constitutional obligation imposed on the State to improve public health. Constitution of India: Art.21 – Right to live with dignity – Right to life enshrined in Art.21 cannot be restricted to mere animal existence – It means something much more than just physical survival – The right to life includes the right to live with human dignity and all that goes along with it, namely, the bare necessaries of life such as adequate nutrition, clothing and shelter, and facilities for reading, writing and expressing oneself in diverse forms, freely moving about and mixing and commingling with fellow human beings – Dignity is the core which unites the fundamental rights because the fundamental rights seek to achieve for each individual the dignity of existence – The State’s obligations are not satisfied solely by refraining from imposing limitations on the right to human dignity – State must also take action to protect human dignity and to facilitate its realization – The constitutional right to dignity is intended to ensure human beings’ political and civil liberties as well as their social and economic freedoms. Constitution of India: Art.23 – Whether the conditions of the bond per se amount to ‘forced labour’ and thus violative of Art.23(1) – Appellants who are required to work for a short period on a decent stipend cannot complain that they are made to perform ‘forced labour’, especially after they took an informed decision to avail the benefits of admission in government medical colleges and received subsidized education – By no means, the service rendered by the Appellants in Government hospitals would fall under the expression of ‘forced labour’ – Art.23(2) enables the State Governments to require the Appellants to do compulsory service in the Government hospitals which is undoubtedly for the benefit of the public. Constitution of India: Art.47 – Right to health is integral to the right to life – Government has a constitutional obligation to provide health facilities – Art.47 reiterates the constitutional obligation imposed on the State to improve public health – It is for the State to secure health to its citizens as its primary duty – No doubt, the Government is rendering this obligation by opening Government hospitals and health centers, but in order to make it meaningful, it has to be within the reach of its people, as far as possible, to reduce the queue of waiting lists, and it has to provide all facilities to employ best of talents and tone up its administration to give effective contribution, which is also the duty of the Government – The immediate need of the deprived sections of the society to have proper health care is the reason behind the Government policy of imposing a condition of compulsory service and a default clause – The objective of the policy is to ensure that specialist health care is extended to the have-nots also – The right that is claimed by the Appellants is to make an individual choice to carry on their profession which might be hindered by the policy decision of the Government – On the other hand, the basic idea behind the Government’s decision is larger public interest – Right to life guaranteed by Art.21 means right to life with human dignity – While balancing communitarian dignity vis-à-vis the dignity of private individuals, the scales must tilt in favour of communitarian dignity – The laudable objective with which the State Governments have introduced compulsory service bonds is to protect the fundamental right of the deprived sections of the society guaranteed to them under Art.21 – The contention of the Appellants that their rights guaranteed under Art.21 have been violated is rejected. Specific Relief Act, 1963: s.14 – Contract of Personal Service – Prohibition of specific performance of contract for personal service – Held: s.14 of the Specific Relief Act prohibits the enforcement of contracts of personal service – It is trite law that Courts do not ordinarily enforce performance of contracts of personal character, such as a contract of employment – None of the State Governments made an attempt to enforce the contracts entered into by them with the appellants through the service bonds – Constitution of India. Contract Act, 1872: s.27 – Restraint on Profession – Plea of the Appellants that compulsory bonds placed a restraint on their profession and thus, would be contrary to s.27 of the Contract Act – Held: A contract entered into by Appellants to serve the government for a few years under reasonable terms cannot be described as one in restraint of trade – The conditions of compulsory bonds for admission to post-graduate and super-Speciality courses in government medical colleges are not in violation of s.27 of the Contract Act – All the Doctors who have executed compulsory bonds shall be bound by the conditions contained therein – Taking note of the fact that certain State Governments have rigid conditions in the compulsory bonds to be executed by the Appellants and the felt need of uniformity in the matter pertaining to the compulsory bonds, suitable steps should be taken by the Union of India and the Medical Council of India to have a uniform policy regarding the compulsory service to be rendered by the Doctors who are trained in government institutions – Constitution of India.",

        "HeadNote": "Constitution of India: Art.162; Seventh Schedule, List I, Entries 63 to 66; List III Entry 25 – Jurisdiction of the State Government – Notification issued by State Government for compulsory execution of bond by the candidates at the time of admission to post-graduate courses and super speciality courses providing that they shall serve the State Government for certain stipulated period on successful completion of courses failing which they would be liable to recompense the State Government – Competence of State Government to issue such notification – Held: Entry 66 of List I of the 7th Schedule to the Constitution refers to coordination and determination of standards in institutions for higher education or research and scientific and technical institutions – Entry 25 of List III of the 7th Schedule deals with education, including technical education, medical education and universities, subject to the provisions of entries 63, 64, 65 and 66 of List I – Legislations can be made by the State Legislature relating to medical education subject to the legislation made by the Parliament – The Medical Council of India Act governs the field of medical education in this country – Admittedly, there is no provision in the Medical Council of India Act touching upon the subject matter of compulsory bonds – Therefore, the States are free to legislate on the subject matter of medical bonds – Executive authority of the State Government is co\u0002extensive with that of the legislative power of the State Legislature – Even in the absence of any legislation, the State Government has the competence to issue executive orders under Art.162 on matters over which the State legislature has the power to legislate – Thus, Notifications issued by the State Governments imposing a condition of execution of compulsory bonds at the time of admission to post\u0002graduate courses and super speciality courses cannot be said to be vitiated due to lack of authority or competence – Medical Council of India Act. Constitution of India: Art.14 – Notification issued by State Government for compulsory execution of bond at the time of admission of candidates to post-graduate courses and super specialty courses providing that they shall serve the State Government for certain stipulated period on successful completion of courses failing which they will be liable to recompense the State Government – Whether violated fundamental rights and is arbitrary – Held: Running medical colleges with post-graduate and super speciality courses requires huge infrastructure – However, the amount of fees charged from the students is meagre in comparison to the private medical colleges – The doctors are to paid reasonable stipend – Government hospitals run by the State are duty bound to extend medical assistance for preserving human life – Failure on the part of a Government hospital to provide timely medical treatment to a person in need of such treatment results in violation of his right guaranteed under Art.21 of the Constitution – Consequently, a policy decision taken by the State Governments to utilize the services of doctors who were beneficiaries of Government assistance to complete their education cannot be termed arbitrary. Constitution of India: Art.14 – Notifications issued by the State Governments imposing a condition of compulsory service and a default clause – Reasonableness of – Held: Notifications imposing a condition of compulsory service and a default clause are per se not unreasonable – However, the period of compulsory service and the exit should be reasonable – State Governments and Armed Forces Medical College are directed to consider imposing the condition of compulsory service period of two years in default of which the Doctors would recompense the Government by paying Rs. 20 Lakhs. Constitution of India: Arts.19(1)(g), 19(6) – Right to life and liberty – Right to take decisions relating to profession – According to the Appellants, the right to carry on their profession guaranteed by Art.19(1)(g) is violated by the compulsory bonds and that any restriction on their right to carry on their profession by the State Government can be made only by a “law” as per Art. 19(6) of the Constitution – Held: The compulsory bond executed by the Appellants is at the time of their admissions into post-graduate and super speciality courses – Conditions imposed for admission to a medical college will not directly violate the right of an individual to carry on his profession – The right to carry on the profession would start on the completion of the course – At the outset, there is no doubt that no right inheres in an individual to receive higher education – Violation of a right guaranteed under Art.19(1)(g) does not arise in a case pertaining to admission to a college – The condition that is imposed has a connection with the professional activity of a doctor on completion of the course – However, the Appellants have, without any protest, accepted the admissions and executed the compulsory bonds – Appellants have not succeeded in their attempt of assailing the Notifications for being violative of Art.19(1)(g) of the Constitution. Constitution of India: Arts.21, 47 – Right to life – Art.21 imposes an obligation on the State to safeguard the right to life of every person – Preservation of human life is thus of paramount importance – The Government hospitals run by the State and the Medical Officers employed therein are duty bound to extend medical assistance for preserving human life – In a welfare State, it is the obligation of the State to ensure the creation and the sustaining of conditions congenial to good health – Art.47 reiterates the constitutional obligation imposed on the State to improve public health. Constitution of India: Art.21 – Right to live with dignity – Right to life enshrined in Art.21 cannot be restricted to mere animal existence – It means something much more than just physical survival – The right to life includes the right to live with human dignity and all that goes along with it, namely, the bare necessaries of life such as adequate nutrition, clothing and shelter, and facilities for reading, writing and expressing oneself in diverse forms, freely moving about and mixing and commingling with fellow human beings – Dignity is the core which unites the fundamental rights because the fundamental rights seek to achieve for each individual the dignity of existence – The State’s obligations are not satisfied solely by refraining from imposing limitations on the right to human dignity – State must also take action to protect human dignity and to facilitate its realization – The constitutional right to dignity is intended to ensure human beings’ political and civil liberties as well as their social and economic freedoms. Constitution of India: Art.23 – Whether the conditions of the bond per se amount to ‘forced labour’ and thus violative of Art.23(1) – Appellants who are required to work for a short period on a decent stipend cannot complain that they are made to perform ‘forced labour’, especially after they took an informed decision to avail the benefits of admission in government medical colleges and received subsidized education – By no means, the service rendered by the Appellants in Government hospitals would fall under the expression of ‘forced labour’ – Art.23(2) enables the State Governments to require the Appellants to do compulsory service in the Government hospitals which is undoubtedly for the benefit of the public. Constitution of India: Art.47 – Right to health is integral to the right to life – Government has a constitutional obligation to provide health facilities – Art.47 reiterates the constitutional obligation imposed on the State to improve public health – It is for the State to secure health to its citizens as its primary duty – No doubt, the Government is rendering this obligation by opening Government hospitals and health centers, but in order to make it meaningful, it has to be within the reach of its people, as far as possible, to reduce the queue of waiting lists, and it has to provide all facilities to employ best of talents and tone up its administration to give effective contribution, which is also the duty of the Government – The immediate need of the deprived sections of the society to have proper health care is the reason behind the Government policy of imposing a condition of compulsory service and a default clause – The objective of the policy is to ensure that specialist health care is extended to the have-nots also – The right that is claimed by the Appellants is to make an individual choice to carry on their profession which might be hindered by the policy decision of the Government – On the other hand, the basic idea behind the Government’s decision is larger public interest – Right to life guaranteed by Art.21 means right to life with human dignity – While balancing communitarian dignity vis-à-vis the dignity of private individuals, the scales must tilt in favour of communitarian dignity – The laudable objective with which the State Governments have introduced compulsory service bonds is to protect the fundamental right of the deprived sections of the society guaranteed to them under Art.21 – The contention of the Appellants that their rights guaranteed under Art.21 have been violated is rejected. Specific Relief Act, 1963: s.14 – Contract of Personal Service – Prohibition of specific performance of contract for personal service – Held: s.14 of the Specific Relief Act prohibits the enforcement of contracts of personal service – It is trite law that Courts do not ordinarily enforce performance of contracts of personal character, such as a contract of employment – None of the State Governments made an attempt to enforce the contracts entered into by them with the appellants through the service bonds – Constitution of India. Contract Act, 1872: s.27 – Restraint on Profession – Plea of the Appellants that compulsory bonds placed a restraint on their profession and thus, would be contrary to s.27 of the Contract Act – Held: A contract entered into by Appellants to serve the government for a few years under reasonable terms cannot be described as one in restraint of trade – The conditions of compulsory bonds for admission to post-graduate and super-Speciality courses in government medical colleges are not in violation of s.27 of the Contract Act – All the Doctors who have executed compulsory bonds shall be bound by the conditions contained therein – Taking note of the fact that certain State Governments have rigid conditions in the compulsory bonds to be executed by the Appellants and the felt need of uniformity in the matter pertaining to the compulsory bonds, suitable steps should be taken by the Union of India and the Medical Council of India to have a uniform policy regarding the compulsory service to be rendered by the Doctors who are trained in government institutions – Constitution of India.",

State of Maharashtra reported as [2018] 4 SCR 877, while dealing with the 1989 Act issued guidelines inter alia viz.- (iii) in view of acknowledged abuse of law of arrest under the 1989 Act, arrest of public servant can only be after approval of the appointing authority and in case of non-public servant after approval by the S.S.P; (iv) preliminary inquiry by Dy.S.P to find out whether allegations make out a case under the 1989 Act and that the same are not frivolous/motivated – Review of – Held: As the members of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes have suffered for long; protective discrimination has been envisaged u/Art.15 and the 1989 Act to make them equals – Offences under the 1989 Act are cognizable – Impugned directions put riders on the right to arrest – It is not open to the legislature to put members of SCs and STs in disadvantageous position vis-à-vis others and in particular to so\u0002called upper castes/general category –What legislature cannot do legitimately, cannot be done by the interpretative process by the courts – For lodging false report, the caste of person is not the cause – It is due to the human failing and not due to the caste factor – There may be certain false cases and that can be ground for interference by the Court u/s.482, CrPC, but the law cannot be changed due to such misuse –More than 47,000 cases were registered in 2016 under the 1989 Act –Number is alarming, and it cannot be said that it is due to the misuse of the Act – To say that report lodged by an SC/ST would be registered only after preliminary investigation by Dy. S.P, whereas under Cr.PC a complaint lodged relating to cognizable offence has to be registered forthwith, would mean that report by upper-caste has to be registered immediately and arrest be made forthwith and thus, would be opposed to the protective discrimination meted out to the members of the SCs and STs as envisaged u/Arts.15, 17 & 21– Guidelines (iii), (iv) appear to have been issued in view of the provisions of s.18, 1989 Act, whereas adequate safeguards have been provided by purposive interpretation by Supreme Court in State of M.P. v. R.K. Balothia [1995] 1 SCR 897 – Permission of the appointing authority to arrest public servant is not at all statutorily envisaged and amounts to mandate having legislative colour which is a field not earmarked for the Courts – If at the threshold, approval of appointing authority is made necessary for arrest, the very purpose of the Act is likely to be frustrated – Various complications may arise– Further, in case of non-public servant requiring the approval of SSP for the arrest of accused could not have been made sine qua non, as it may delay the matter – As the approval of arrest by appointing authority/S.S.P. have not been approved, the direction to record reasons and scrutiny by Magistrate consequently stands nullified – Direction nos.(iii), (iv) issued by Supreme Court recalled – Consequently, direction no.(v) also vanishes –Constitution of India– Arts.15, 17, 21 and 142 – Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 –ss. 2(c), 41, 197, 438 & 482– Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Rules, 1995 – r.7(2) – Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Amendment Rules, 2016.

S.P, whereas under Cr.PC a complaint lodged relating to cognizable offence has to be registered forthwith, would mean that report by upper-caste has to be registered immediately and arrest be made forthwith and thus, would be opposed to the protective discrimination meted out to the members of the SCs and STs as envisaged u/Arts.15, 17 & 21– Guidelines (iii), (iv) appear to have been issued in view of the provisions of s.18, 1989 Act, whereas adequate safeguards have been provided by purposive interpretation by Supreme Court in State of M.P. v. R.K. Balothia [1995] 1 SCR 897 – Permission of the appointing authority to arrest public servant is not at all statutorily envisaged and amounts to mandate having legislative colour which is a field not earmarked for the Courts – If at the threshold, approval of appointing authority is made necessary for arrest, the very purpose of the Act is likely to be frustrated – Various complications may arise– Further, in case of non-public servant requiring the approval of SSP for the arrest of accused could not have been made sine qua non, as it may delay the matter – As the approval of arrest by appointing authority/S.S.P. have not been approved, the direction to record reasons and scrutiny by Magistrate consequently stands nullified – Direction nos.(iii), (iv) issued by Supreme Court recalled – Consequently, direction no.(v) also vanishes –Constitution of India– Arts.15, 17, 21 and 142 – Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 –ss. 2(c), 41, 197, 438 & 482– Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Rules, 1995 – r.7(2) – Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Amendment Rules, 2016.

State of Maharashtra reported as [2018] 4 SCR 877, while dealing with the 1989 Act issued guidelines inter alia viz.- (iii) in view of acknowledged abuse of law of arrest under the 1989 Act, arrest of public servant can only be after approval of the appointing authority and in case of non-public servant after approval by the S.S.P; (iv) preliminary inquiry by Dy.S.P to find out whether allegations make out a case under the 1989 Act and that the same are not frivolous/motivated – Review of – Held: As the members of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes have suffered for long; protective discrimination has been envisaged u/Art.15 and the 1989 Act to make them equals – Offences under the 1989 Act are cognizable – Impugned directions put riders on the right to arrest – It is not open to the legislature to put members of SCs and STs in disadvantageous position vis-à-vis others and in particular to so\u0002called upper castes/general category –What legislature cannot do legitimately, cannot be done by the interpretative process by the courts – For lodging false report, the caste of person is not the cause – It is due to the human failing and not due to the caste factor – There may be certain false cases and that can be ground for interference by the Court u/s.482, CrPC, but the law cannot be changed due to such misuse –More than 47,000 cases were registered in 2016 under the 1989 Act –Number is alarming, and it cannot be said that it is due to the misuse of the Act – To say that report lodged by an SC/ST would be registered only after preliminary investigation by Dy. S.P, whereas under Cr.PC a complaint lodged relating to cognizable offence has to be registered forthwith, would mean that report by upper-caste has to be registered immediately and arrest be made forthwith and thus, would be opposed to the protective discrimination meted out to the members of the SCs and STs as envisaged u/Arts.15, 17 & 21– Guidelines (iii), (iv) appear to have been issued in view of the provisions of s.18, 1989 Act, whereas adequate safeguards have been provided by purposive interpretation by Supreme Court in State of M.P. v. R.K. Balothia [1995] 1 SCR 897 – Permission of the appointing authority to arrest public servant is not at all statutorily envisaged and amounts to mandate having legislative colour which is a field not earmarked for the Courts – If at the threshold, approval of appointing authority is made necessary for arrest, the very purpose of the Act is likely to be frustrated – Various complications may arise– Further, in case of non-public servant requiring the approval of SSP for the arrest of accused could not have been made sine qua non, as it may delay the matter – As the approval of arrest by appointing authority/S.S.P. have not been approved, the direction to record reasons and scrutiny by Magistrate consequently stands nullified – Direction nos.(iii), (iv) issued by Supreme Court recalled – Consequently, direction no.(v) also vanishes –Constitution of India– Arts.15, 17, 21 and 142 – Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 –ss. 2(c), 41, 197, 438 & 482– Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Rules, 1995 – r.7(2) – Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Amendment Rules, 2016.

S.P, whereas under Cr.PC a complaint lodged relating to cognizable offence has to be registered forthwith, would mean that report by upper-caste has to be registered immediately and arrest be made forthwith and thus, would be opposed to the protective discrimination meted out to the members of the SCs and STs as envisaged u/Arts.15, 17 & 21– Guidelines (iii), (iv) appear to have been issued in view of the provisions of s.18, 1989 Act, whereas adequate safeguards have been provided by purposive interpretation by Supreme Court in State of M.P. v.

and the Team Categories, and invited objections to the same – Appellant raised no objection to the provisional list – On 27.5.2019, the Final List of eligible candidates under both the Individual and Team Quotas was prepared – Appellant did not raise any objection even at this stage – Final list was forwarded to the State CEE – On 6.6.2019, the All India NEET-UG 2019 result was declared – CEE published the category-wise list of candidates eligible for M.B.B.S., including the Sports Quota in the Individual and the Team Category on 28.6.2019 – There were 7 seats available for the Sports Quota for admission to M.B.B.S. course, while 2 seats were reserved for B.D.S. – Out of 7 seats, 4 seats were allotted to the Individual event category, and 3 were allotted to the Team event category – Appellant secured final marks of 548.4722 in the NEET-UG examination, after including the marks awarded to him in the Individual category – Respondent No.5 was awarded 669.1667 in the Sports Individual category while Respondent No.1 was awarded 594.0278 in the Team category – Appellant filed a Representation to the Sports Council alleging that Respondent No. 5 had wrongly been included in the Individual List, as he had participated in a Team event – Appellant then filed writ petition before High Court praying inter alia for a direction to Sports Council to re-consider the marks allotted to him and consider shifting Respondent No. 5 to the Sports (Team) List – During the pendency of the Writ Petition, on 6.7.2019, the State Sports Council informed CEE that 4 candidates including Respondent No.5 had erroneously been included in the Final Individual List, even though they ought to have been included in the Team List – CEE declined to consider communication dated 6.7.2019 received after the publication of the final list – Single Judge of High Court allowed the Writ Petition, holding that CEE was obligated to act on the communication of the State Sports Council – Accordingly, Respondent No.5 was directed to be considered for admission in the Sports (Team) List – Aggrieved, Respondent no.1 filed writ appeal – Division Bench of High Court set aside the order of single judge and directed that the rank of Respondent no. 1 and 5 be retained as per the list prepared on 28.6.2019 – Hence the appeal – Held: Writ Petition by the Appellant was wholly speculative in nature – The entire case of the Appellant was based upon shifting Respondent No.5 from the Individual Quota to the Team Quota so that Appellant gets selected in the Individual category, and having the marks added to his NEET score – Such a plea was wholly unfounded, particularly since out of the candidates in the Sports (Individual) category, the Appellant admittedly scored the lowest marks – Respondent No. 1 had secured 57 marks, while Respondent No. 5 had secured 53 marks – Appellant did not disclose in the Writ Petition, that if the relief prayed for was granted, it would have resulted in the displacement of another student in the Team category who had scored 60 marks in the final result who was not even joined as a party to the proceedings – Hence, the prayer made by the Appellant was liable to be rejected on this ground also – The entire case of the Appellant was an afterthought, and made at a belated stage of the admission process, and cannot be entertained – Appellant ought to have approached this Court with candour, and disclosed the correct facts – Sports Council was wholly unjustified in making a recommendation for shifting Respondent No. 5 after the release of Final List – The consequence of implementing such a direction at such a belated stage, would be that the entire admission process under the Sports Quota would require to be re-done – The prayer of the Appellant to consider Respondent No. 5 in the Sports (Team) Quota was unsustainable on merits – Appeals dismissed.

– Appellant secured final marks of 548.4722 in the NEET-UG examination, after including the marks awarded to him in the Individual category – Respondent No.5 was awarded 669.1667 in the Sports Individual category while Respondent No.1 was awarded 594.0278 in the Team category – Appellant filed a Representation to the Sports Council alleging that Respondent No. 5 had wrongly been included in the Individual List, as he had participated in a Team event – Appellant then filed writ petition before High Court praying inter alia for a direction to Sports Council to re-consider the marks allotted to him and consider shifting Respondent No. 5 to the Sports (Team) List – During the pendency of the Writ Petition, on 6.7.2019, the State Sports Council informed CEE that 4 candidates including Respondent No.5 had erroneously been included in the Final Individual List, even though they ought to have been included in the Team List – CEE declined to consider communication dated 6.7.2019 received after the publication of the final list – Single Judge of High Court allowed the Writ Petition, holding that CEE was obligated to act on the communication of the State Sports Council – Accordingly, Respondent No.5 was directed to be considered for admission in the Sports (Team) List – Aggrieved, Respondent no.1 filed writ appeal – Division Bench of High Court set aside the order of single judge and directed that the rank of Respondent no. 1 and 5 be retained as per the list prepared on 28.6.2019 – Hence the appeal – Held: Writ Petition by the Appellant was wholly speculative in nature – The entire case of the Appellant was based upon shifting Respondent No.5 from the Individual Quota to the Team Quota so that Appellant gets selected in the Individual category, and having the marks added to his NEET score – Such a plea was wholly unfounded, particularly since out of the candidates in the Sports (Individual) category, the Appellant admittedly scored the lowest marks – Respondent No. 1 had secured 57 marks, while Respondent No. 5 had secured 53 marks – Appellant did not disclose in the Writ Petition, that if the relief prayed for was granted, it would have resulted in the displacement of another student in the Team category who had scored 60 marks in the final result who was not even joined as a party to the proceedings – Hence, the prayer made by the Appellant was liable to be rejected on this ground also – The entire case of the Appellant was an afterthought, and made at a belated stage of the admission process, and cannot be entertained – Appellant ought to have approached this Court with candour, and disclosed the correct facts – Sports Council was wholly unjustified in making a recommendation for shifting Respondent No. 5 after the release of Final List – The consequence of implementing such a direction at such a belated stage, would be that the entire admission process under the Sports Quota would require to be re-done – The prayer of the Appellant to consider Respondent No. 5 in the Sports (Team) Quota was unsustainable on merits – Appeals dismissed.
