before the HighCourt – In the instant case, Election Commission of India (ECI) hadaccepted the claim of respondent Nos.4 to 6 and the SLP petitioner-EKP that the group led by respondent No.4-EM was entitled to usethe name of the original registered and recognized state politicalparty and rejected the claim of respondent No.1 and respondentNo.3-VKS that the group led by VKS was the real group and wasentitled to use name and symbol of the party AIADMK – Writ petitionfiled by respondent No.1 before the High Court to assail the decisionof the ECI – The said writ petition is still pending – Meanwhile, aselections in the State of Tamil Nadu were announced, respondentNo.1 and the group of which he was a member moved an interimapplication before the High Court in the pending writ petition forpermission to use a suitable name for carrying out its politicalactivities – High Court allowed the same by order dated 9 th March,2018 – Aggrieved by the said decision, the SLP petitioner-EKPespousing the cause of the group led by EM, filed SLP – When theSLP, along with connected cases, was taken up for hearing on 28 thMarch, 2018, amongst others, it was pointed out to the Court thatthe impending elections to the local bodies were countermandedand as a result, the basis for instituting the interim application byrespondent No.1 did not exist – In that view of the matter, the interimorder passed by the High Court was kept in abeyance with thedirections that the ECI shall not pronounce its order and grantedliberty to the parties to approach this court in case of any notification for an election – Accordingly the SLP was disposed of – RespondentNo.1 filed the instant Application asserting that the bye-electionwas notified by the ECI on 31 st December, 2018 and the date ofpolling was fixed for 28 th January, 2019 – SLP petitioner andrespondent Nos.4 to 6, as well as respondent No.2, raised apreliminary objection about the maintainability of this application– Held: Respondent No.1 had no other option but to present theinstant application because of the publication of the electionschedule by the ECI, in light of the liberty given by this Court byorder dated 28 th March, 2018 – As liberty was given to the partieseven though the SLPs were ostensibly disposed of, not entertainingthis application, only because the order dated 28 th March, 2018records that SLPs are disposed of, would be completely trivializingthe spirit of the liberty given to the parties by this Court in thepeculiar fact situation – Respondent No.1 cannot be directed to goback to the High Court for the relief claimed in this applicationbecause similar relief was already considered by the Single Judgeof the High Court on 9 th March, 2018 in favour of the grouprepresented by the applicant – The directions given by the SingleJudge in the said order had not been independently challenged bythe ECI by filing SLP before this Court – Besides, it may not beappropriate for the Division Bench to re-visit the matters in issuedealt with in the judgment and interim order passed by the SingleJudge dated 9 th March, 2018, which was kept in abeyance by thisCourt – No merit in the preliminary objection raised by the SLPpetitioner, respondent Nos.4 to 6 and respondent No.2.Election Laws – Whether a faction represented by respondentno.1-TTVD and VKS which claims to be the real party having supportof majority of the members at the time of initiation of the disputebefore the ECI and that claim was still pending consideration beforethe High Court ought to be compelled to first register itself as apolitical party and after following the process of obtainingrecognition could only then set up its claim for allotment of a reservedsymbol and use of name – Held: During the pendency of the writpetition, as elections in the State of Tamil Nadu were announcedand respondent No.1 and the group of which he was a member,wanted to contest the elections, they moved an interim applicationbefore the High Court in the pending writ petition – High Court deemed it appropriate to issue directions to allot common symbol tothe faction represented by respondent no.1 in different constituencieswhere they would nominate candidates to contest in ensuing elections– High Court was conscious of the fact that ordinarily commonsymbol can be allotted only to registered recognized political partyand if the ECI could do so in exercise of its plenary powers whenthe dispute is pending before it, there could be no impediment forthe writ court to pass appropriate directions especially when noreal prejudice would be caused to any other party and the claimregarding which faction is the real party has still not attained finalityand that would ensure a level playing field in the political spherefor the concerned factions – High Court was right in holding that ifECI considers itself competent to pass interim directions for ensuringlevel playing field to both the factions during the adjudication ofthe dispute pending before it, there is no reason why, on the samelogic the High Court, being a court of equity, is not competent to doso when the final decision of the ECI was still pending challengebefore it – Representation of the People Act, 1951 – s.29A –Constitution of India – Art.226.Election Laws – Powers of Election Commission (ECI) – ECIhas plenary powers and could exercise the same to ensure free andfair elections – Clause 18 of the Symbols Order predicates the facetof such plenary power to be exercised by the ECI – Symbols Order,1968.Election Laws – Allocation of common symbols to two factionwhen the dispute under the Symbol Order is still pending before theElection Commission (ECI) – Interim directions regarding allocationby the ECI – Permissibility – Held: Once the dispute had been finallydecided by the ECI, the question of invoking powers underparagraph 18 by it (ECI) would not arise – However, if the disputeis pending enquiry before ECI or the final decision of the ECI issub judice in the proceedings before the constitutional court,providing for an equitable arrangement in the interests of free andfair elections and to provide equal level playing field to allconcerned, would be a just and fair arrangement.Election Laws – Whether there was any impediment for thewrit court (High Court) to pass appropriate interim direction whilethe validity of the decision of the Election Commission (ECI) is sub judice before it – Held: High Court was right in holding that fordoing justice and protecting the interests of all concerned and touphold the democratic principles, including for ensuring free andfair elections, it would be just and proper to continue the interimarrangement as was directed by the ECI regarding allotment of acommon symbol to the political group represented by respondentno.1 especially when such relief would not cause any prejudice toany other person or party nor impinge upon the powers of the ECI– Symbols Order, 1968.Representation of the People Act, 1951 – s.29A – Allotmentof a common symbol – If the political group is not registered unders.29A of the 1951 Act and is not recognized as per the provisions ofSymbols Order, 1968, it may not be entitled to claim allotment of acommon symbol which is reserved for a registered and recognizedState/National political party – Paragraphs 9 to 11 would apply tosuch registered and recognized political party which provide for anoption of a reserved symbol – For any other candidate or candidatebelonging to unregistered or unrecognized party, his claim wouldbe dealt with under paragraph 12 of the Symbol Order, 1968 – Theclosest provision is paragraph 15 of the Symbol Order, which dealswith the powers of the ECI in relation to splinter groups or rivalfactions of the political party – But once that dispute is answeredby the ECI and that decision attains finality, the splinter group willhave no other option but to register itself as a political party andonly after fulfillment of the requirements specified in paragraphs6A to 6C of the Symbols Order, 1968, as applicable, may be givenrecognition as a National or State political party – In the instantcase, the decision of the ECI is sub judice before the High Courtand the claim of the group or faction of being the original registeredrecognized State political party represented by respondent No.1, issubject to the outcome thereof – Until such time, there is no justreason as to why the interim arrangement such as ordered by theECI in terms of the interim order dated 22 nd March, 2017, asapplicable to the group represented by respondent No.1, ought notto continue – The direction issued in terms of order dated 28 th March,2018, to keep the interim order of the High Court dated 9 th March,2018, in abeyance and consequently to restrain the ECI frompronouncing its order on the application preferred by the political group represented by respondent No.1 needs to be vacated –However, considering the fact that the hearing on the writ petitionbefore the Division Bench of the High Court has almost reached atthe final stage, it is deemed appropriate to mould the reliefs in thefollowing terms: (a) If the writ petition is not finally disposed of bythe Division Bench of the High Court within four weeks from today,the ECI shall process the application of the group represented byrespondent No.1 in terms of the directions given by the High Courtby interim order dated 9 th March, 2018 and issue appropriatedirections within two weeks therefrom (i.e. four weeks plus twoweeks, from today) – (b) In the event, before the expiry of the statedperiod, the ECI intends to issue any Press Note or Notification forannouncing the bye-elections in respect of the vacant AssemblyConstituencies in the State of Tamil Nadu or Parliamentary Electionsfor 2019, as the case may be, it shall pass appropriate directions incompliance with the interim order of the High Court dated 9 th March,2018, within one week from the date of release of such Press Noteor Notification and in any case, before the date notified for filingof the nominations, whichever is earlier – Symbols

National Green Tribunal Act, 2010 – Powers of judicial review– Held: Under the NGT Act, the Tribunal exercising appellatejurisdiction cannot strike down rules or regulations made underthis Act – It would be fallacious to state that the Tribunal has powersof judicial review akin to that of a High Court exercisingconstitutional powers u/Art. 226 of the Constitution of India –Constitution of India – Art.226.Doctrines/Principles – Doctrine of Necessity – NGT statedthat the doctrine of necessity would take over if an appellateauthority under the Act is not properly constituted – Held: If anappellate authority is either not yet constituted, or not properlyconstituted, a leapfrog appeal to the NGT cannot be countenanced– NGT is only conferred appellate jurisdiction from an order passedin exercise of first appeal – Where there is no such order, the NGThas no jurisdiction – National Green Tribunal Act, 2010 – Water(Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974 – Air (Preventionand Control of Pollution) Act,1981.",

National Green Tribunal Act, 2010 – Powers of judicial review– Held: Under the NGT Act, the Tribunal exercising appellatejurisdiction cannot strike down rules or regulations made underthis Act – It would be fallacious to state that the Tribunal has powersof judicial review akin to that of a High Court exercisingconstitutional powers u/Art. 226 of the Constitution of India –Constitution of India – Art.226.Doctrines/Principles – Doctrine of Necessity – NGT statedthat the doctrine of necessity would take over if an appellateauthority under the Act is not properly constituted – Held: If anappellate authority is either not yet constituted, or not properlyconstituted, a leapfrog appeal to the NGT cannot be countenanced– NGT is only conferred appellate jurisdiction from an order passedin exercise of first appeal – Where there is no such order, the NGThas no jurisdiction – National Green Tribunal Act, 2010 – Water(Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974 – Air (Preventionand Control of Pollution) Act,1981.",

Sikri, J.) – Entry 41 of List IIdeals with ‘State Public Services’ and ‘State Public ServiceCommission’ – It is undisputed that State Public Service Commissiondoes not exist in NCTD – When dealing with All India Services andDANICS Services etc., it is also doubtful to mention it as State PublicService – GNCTD has endeavoured to assume the executive powerin respect of ‘services’ by relying upon Entry 41 of List II, whichmay be doubtful – That situation may give discretionary powers tothe LG – On the other hand, it also cannot be said that once themanpower is allocated to Union Territory of Delhi, the GNCTDshould not have any power to deal with such employees – In such ascenario, and to avoid any conflict of exercise of powers betweenthe LG on the one hand and the Council of Ministers with Chief Minister as Head on the other hand, for the smooth functioning ofthe system, just and fair mechanism to be carved out – The transfersand postings of Secretaries, HODs and other officers in the scaleof Joint Secretary to the Government of India and above can bedone by the LG and the file submitted to him directly – For otherlevels, including DANICS officers, the files can be routed throughthe Chief Minister to the LG – In case of difference of opinionbetween the LG and the Chief Minister, the view of the LG wouldprevail and the Ministry of Home Affairs would issue a suitablenotification in that regard – However, for Grade IV, III, II and IDASS officials, there is an existing delegation of powers where forGrades IV and III, all transfers and postings are done by theSecretary (Services); for Grades II and I, the transfers and postingsare done by the Chief Secretary – For greater transparency, a CivilServices Board can be formed which can be headed by the Secretary(Services) for Grades IV and III officials; by the Chief Secretaryfor Grades II and I level officers – The Board can decide on thetransfer and postings of these DASS cadre officers – Similar Boardcan also be formed for DANICS officers – In the interest of goodgovernance and smooth Governmental function, efforts should bemade by both the Chief Minister as well as the LG for a harmoniousworking relation – (Per Ashok Bhushan, J.)(Partly Dissenting) –Entry 41 of List II of the Seventh Schedule is not available to theLegislative Assembly of GNCTD – Having held so, there is nooccasion to exercise any Executive power with regard to “Services”by the GNCTD, since the Executive power of the GNCTD as perArt.239AA(4) extend in relation to matters with respect to whichLegislative Assembly has power to make laws – With regard to“Services” GNCTD can exercise only those Executive powers, whichcan be exercised by it under any law framed by the Parliament or itmay exercise those Executive powers, which have been delegatedto it – Constitution of India – Art.239AA – Indian AdministrativeServices (Cadre) Rules, 1954 – r.2(c). Constitution of India – Seventh Schedule, List II, Entry 2 –Whether the exclusion of the jurisdiction of the Anti-CorruptionBranch (ACB) of the NCTD to investigate offences committed underthe Prevention of Corruption Act by the officials of the CentralGovernment and limiting the jurisdiction of the ACB to the employees of the GNCTD alone is legal – Held: ACB is not empowered toinvestigate into the offences of Central Government employees underthe Prevention of Corruption Act – Such investigation is carriedout by CBI – Therefore, it obviates the duality and conflict ofjurisdiction as well – As per Notifications dated 23.7.2014 and21.5.2015, the jurisdiction of ACB is limited to the employees ofGNCTD only – Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 – s.2(s) –Prevention of Corruption Act, 1947.Constitution of India – Seventh Schedule, List II, Entry 2 –Term ‘police’ occurring therein – Meaning of – Held: It is a settledprinciple that legislative entries are to be interpreted in a broadand liberal manner consistent with imputing to them the widestamplitude and as including all ancillary and subsidiary matters –The scope of the term ‘Police’ as occurring in Entry 2 of List IIcannot, therefore, be artificially restricted or limited to onlyconstitution of the Police force, but would take within its fold thelegislative (and, therefore, executive) power to exercise supervisionand control over the functioning of the Police so constituted,including by way of issuance of executive directions delineatingthe powers, functions and jurisdiction of different wings/sectionsof the Police – Entry 2 List II would also include the determinationas to the nature and scope of investigations to be done by the Police– Therefore, while establishing the ACB as a Police Station, it wouldbe permissible to circumscribe and limit the investigation sphere ofthe ACB.Constitution of India – Seventh Schedule, List II, Entry 1 –Notification dated 23.7.2014 and 21.5.2015 – By these Notifications,the jurisdiction of ACB was limited to the employees of GNCTD –Validity of these notifications challenged on the ground that s.2(s)empowers the State Government to notify a police station and theimpugned notification was issued by the Central Government andpost 69 th Amendment, the Central Government is not the StateGovernment for exercising power under s.2(s) – Held: No doubt,s.2(s) of the Cr.P.C. contemplates establishment of the police stationby the State Government – However, the Cr.P.C. also lays down theprocedure for making arrest, conducting investigation and submittingfinal reports – It does not contain any provision which prescribeswhat offences would be investigated by which police force – Theseprovisions do not provide how parallel jurisdiction of two policestations is to be demarcated – In fact, parallel jurisdiction toinvestigate is not contemplated by Cr.P.C. as that would result inchaos and anarchy and would frustrate the very purpose ofinvestigation – Therefore, the Government which has competenceover Entry 2 List II would have power to segregate and demarcatethe jurisdiction to investigate as between two police forces – Thus,the impugned notifications are valid – This conclusion becomesinevitable when Cr.P.C. is read with the Delhi Police Act, 1978 andother cognate enactments – Entry 1 of List II, subject matter whereofis ‘public order’, also stands excluded from the purview of GNCTDand is the exclusive domain of the Parliament/ Central Executive –The term ‘public order’ includes cognizance of offences, search,seizure and arrest, followed by registration of reports of offences(FIRs), investigation, prosecution, trial and in the event ofconviction, execution of sentences as well – All these aspects are tobe construed conjointly – Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 – s.2(s)– Interpretation of Statutes.Commission of Inquiry Act, 1952 – s.2(a) – Whether theGNCTD is an ‘appropriate Government’ under the Commission ofInquiry Act, 1952 – Held: s.3(8) of the General Clauses (GC) Actdefines Central Government – s.3(60) of the GC Act, on the otherhand, defines State Government – The GC Act also defines‘Government’, ‘State’ and ‘Union Territory’ – No doubt, definitionof State as contained in s.3(58) includes Union Territory – In respectof Union Territory, the State Government would mean the CentralGovernment – The expression ‘State Government’ occurring in s.2(a)of the COI Act which defines ‘Appropriate Government’ would notmean GNCTD, a Union Territory – General Clauses Act –ss.3(8) and 3(60).Electricity Act, 2003 – s.108 – Whether under s.108 of theElectricity Act, 2003 and under s.12 of the Delhi Electricity ReformsAct, 2000, the power to issue directions to the State Commission iswith the GNCTD – Held: Under s.2(5)(b) of the Electricity Act, 2003,Appropriate Government is the State Government having jurisdictionunder this Act in all those cases which do not come within the domainof ‘Central Government’ – Insofar as NCTD is concerned, it hasits own Commission, namely, DERC – DER Act also stipulates powersof Government in Part IV thereof – General powers of theGovernment, inter alia, include giving directions to the DERC inmatters of policy involving public interest, as the Government mayissue from time to time – These powers are akin to the powers givenunder s.108 of the Electricity Act, 2003 – Insofar as DER Act isconcerned, it is an enactment enacted by Legislative Assembly ofNCTD – It operates within the NCTD – Under this Act, DelhiGovernment has power to issue directions to the DERC in mattersof policies involving public interest – When such powers areconferred specifically to Delhi Government under DER Act, it cannotbe said that insofar as s.108 of the Electricity Act, 2003 is concerned,the expression ‘State Government’ therein would mean the CentralGovernment – Delhi Electricity Reforms Act, 2000 – s.12.Stamp Act, 1899 – Whether the GNCTD had the power torevise the minimum rates of Agricultural Land (Circle Rates) underthe provisions of Stamp Act, 1899 – GNCTD issued the notificationdated August 4, 2015 revising the rates of Agricultural Land (CircleRates) under the provisions of Indian Stamp Act, 1899 and DelhiStamp (Prevention of Under-Valuation of Instruments) Rules, 2007– Before issuing this notification, matter was not placed before theLG for his views or concurrence – Held: Notification dated August4, 2015 revising the rates of agricultural land (circle rates) istraceable to Entry 63 of List II and not to Entry 18 of List II – Saidnotification is issued under the provisions of 1899 Act and 2007Rules – Circle rates are fixed for the purpose of payment of stampduty – Therefore, they do not pertain to ‘land’ namely rights in orover land, land tenures etc. or transfer of alienation of agriculturalland etc. – Stamp duty is not a duty on instrument but it is in realitya duty on transfer of property – In that sense, the occasion for levyof stamp duty is the document which is executed as distinguishedfrom the transaction which is embodied in the document – However,even when the executive wing of Delhi Government takes a decision,the LG is also empowered to form its opinion ‘on any matter’ whichmay be different from the decision taken by his Ministers – Anymatter does not mean each and ‘every matter’ or ‘every triflingmatter’ but only those rare and exceptional matters where thedifference is so fundamental to the governance of the Union Territorythat it deserved to be escalated to the President – Therefore, the LGis not expected to differ routinely with the decision of Council ofMinister – At the same time, the proviso recognises that there maybe contingencies where LG and his Ministers may differ – In suchcircumstances, LG is supposed to refer the matter to the Presidentfor decision and act according to the decision given thereon by thePresident – It means that final say, in case of difference betweenLG and Council of Ministers, is that of the President – Such a schemeof things clearly contemplates that the Council of Ministers issupposed to convey its decisions to the LG to enable the LG to formhis view thereupon – The decision cannot be implemented withoutreferring the same to the LG in the first instance – More pertinently,the decision here touches upon the governance of the UT –Therefore, views of LG should have been taken before issuingNotification dated August 4, 2015 – Constitution of India – Schedule7 List II Entry 63 – Delhi Stamp (Prevention of Under-Valuation ofInstruments) Rules, 2007 – Notification dated August 4, 2015. Constitution of India – Art.239AA, clause (4) and its proviso– LG, role of – Normally, and generally, the LG is expected to honourthe wisdom of the council of ministers – He is also expected to clearthe files expeditiously and is not supposed to sit over it unduly – Heis under duty to bear in mind expediency and urgency of the subjectmatter of the decisions taken by the GNCTD, where ever situationso demands – That in fact is the facet of good governance –Likewise, the executive is also expected to give due deference to theunique nature of the role assigned to the LG in the Constitutionalscheme – By and large, it demands a mutual respect between thetwo organs – Both should realise that they are to serve the peopleof NCTD – Mutual cooperation, thus, becomes essential for theeffective working of the system. Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 – s.24 – Power to appointthe Special Public Prosecutor – Whether it is the LG or the GNCTDwhich has the power to appoint the Special Public Prosecutor unders.24, Cr.PC. – Held: Special Public Prosecutor is appointed as perthe provisions of s.24(8) of Cr.P.C. which is to the effect that powerto appoint Special Public Prosecutor is conferred both upon theCentral Government and the State Government – Insofar as NCTDis concerned, the ‘State Government’ means the LG for the purposesof s.24(8) of Cr.P.C. – In respect of Entries 1 and 2 of List III, theGNCTD has legislative competence under Art.239AA of theConstitution and that the LG under Art.239AA(4) of the Constitutionshall act on the aid and advice of the Council of Ministers –Constitution of India – Art.239AA",

Sikri, J.) – Entry 41 of List IIdeals with ‘State Public Services’ and ‘State Public ServiceCommission’ – It is undisputed that State Public Service Commissiondoes not exist in NCTD – When dealing with All India Services andDANICS Services etc., it is also doubtful to mention it as State PublicService – GNCTD has endeavoured to assume the executive powerin respect of ‘services’ by relying upon Entry 41 of List II, whichmay be doubtful – That situation may give discretionary powers tothe LG – On the other hand, it also cannot be said that once themanpower is allocated to Union Territory of Delhi, the GNCTDshould not have any power to deal with such employees – In such ascenario, and to avoid any conflict of exercise of powers betweenthe LG on the one hand and the Council of Ministers with Chief Minister as Head on the other hand, for the smooth functioning ofthe system, just and fair mechanism to be carved out – The transfersand postings of Secretaries, HODs and other officers in the scaleof Joint Secretary to the Government of India and above can bedone by the LG and the file submitted to him directly – For otherlevels, including DANICS officers, the files can be routed throughthe Chief Minister to the LG – In case of difference of opinionbetween the LG and the Chief Minister, the view of the LG wouldprevail and the Ministry of Home Affairs would issue a suitablenotification in that regard – However, for Grade IV, III, II and IDASS officials, there is an existing delegation of powers where forGrades IV and III, all transfers and postings are done by theSecretary (Services); for Grades II and I, the transfers and postingsare done by the Chief Secretary – For greater transparency, a CivilServices Board can be formed which can be headed by the Secretary(Services) for Grades IV and III officials; by the Chief Secretaryfor Grades II and I level officers – The Board can decide on thetransfer and postings of these DASS cadre officers – Similar Boardcan also be formed for DANICS officers – In the interest of goodgovernance and smooth Governmental function, efforts should bemade by both the Chief Minister as well as the LG for a harmoniousworking relation – (Per Ashok Bhushan, J.)(Partly Dissenting) –Entry 41 of List II of the Seventh Schedule is not available to theLegislative Assembly of GNCTD – Having held so, there is nooccasion to exercise any Executive power with regard to “Services”by the GNCTD, since the Executive power of the GNCTD as perArt.239AA(4) extend in relation to matters with respect to whichLegislative Assembly has power to make laws – With regard to“Services” GNCTD can exercise only those Executive powers, whichcan be exercised by it under any law framed by the Parliament or itmay exercise those Executive powers, which have been delegatedto it – Constitution of India – Art.239AA – Indian AdministrativeServices (Cadre) Rules, 1954 – r.2(c). Constitution of India – Seventh Schedule, List II, Entry 2 –Whether the exclusion of the jurisdiction of the Anti-CorruptionBranch (ACB) of the NCTD to investigate offences committed underthe Prevention of Corruption Act by the officials of the CentralGovernment and limiting the jurisdiction of the ACB to the employees of the GNCTD alone is legal – Held: ACB is not empowered toinvestigate into the offences of Central Government employees underthe Prevention of Corruption Act – Such investigation is carriedout by CBI – Therefore, it obviates the duality and conflict ofjurisdiction as well – As per Notifications dated 23.7.2014 and21.5.2015, the jurisdiction of ACB is limited to the employees ofGNCTD only – Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 – s.2(s) –Prevention of Corruption Act, 1947.Constitution of India – Seventh Schedule, List II, Entry 2 –Term ‘police’ occurring therein – Meaning of – Held: It is a settledprinciple that legislative entries are to be interpreted in a broadand liberal manner consistent with imputing to them the widestamplitude and as including all ancillary and subsidiary matters –The scope of the term ‘Police’ as occurring in Entry 2 of List IIcannot, therefore, be artificially restricted or limited to onlyconstitution of the Police force, but would take within its fold thelegislative (and, therefore, executive) power to exercise supervisionand control over the functioning of the Police so constituted,including by way of issuance of executive directions delineatingthe powers, functions and jurisdiction of different wings/sectionsof the Police – Entry 2 List II would also include the determinationas to the nature and scope of investigations to be done by the Police– Therefore, while establishing the ACB as a Police Station, it wouldbe permissible to circumscribe and limit the investigation sphere ofthe ACB.Constitution of India – Seventh Schedule, List II, Entry 1 –Notification dated 23.7.2014 and 21.5.2015 – By these Notifications,the jurisdiction of ACB was limited to the employees of GNCTD –Validity of these notifications challenged on the ground that s.2(s)empowers the State Government to notify a police station and theimpugned notification was issued by the Central Government andpost 69 th Amendment, the Central Government is not the StateGovernment for exercising power under s.2(s) – Held: No doubt,s.2(s) of the Cr.P.C."

Sikri, J.) – Entry 41 of List IIdeals with ‘State Public Services’ and ‘State Public ServiceCommission’ – It is undisputed that State Public Service Commissiondoes not exist in NCTD – When dealing with All India Services andDANICS Services etc., it is also doubtful to mention it as State PublicService – GNCTD has endeavoured to assume the executive powerin respect of ‘services’ by relying upon Entry 41 of List II, whichmay be doubtful – That situation may give discretionary powers tothe LG – On the other hand, it also cannot be said that once themanpower is allocated to Union Territory of Delhi, the GNCTDshould not have any power to deal with such employees – In such ascenario, and to avoid any conflict of exercise of powers betweenthe LG on the one hand and the Council of Ministers with Chief Minister as Head on the other hand, for the smooth functioning ofthe system, just and fair mechanism to be carved out – The transfersand postings of Secretaries, HODs and other officers in the scaleof Joint Secretary to the Government of India and above can bedone by the LG and the file submitted to him directly – For otherlevels, including DANICS officers, the files can be routed throughthe Chief Minister to the LG – In case of difference of opinionbetween the LG and the Chief Minister, the view of the LG wouldprevail and the Ministry of Home Affairs would issue a suitablenotification in that regard – However, for Grade IV, III, II and IDASS officials, there is an existing delegation of powers where forGrades IV and III, all transfers and postings are done by theSecretary (Services); for Grades II and I, the transfers and postingsare done by the Chief Secretary – For greater transparency, a CivilServices Board can be formed which can be headed by the Secretary(Services) for Grades IV and III officials; by the Chief Secretaryfor Grades II and I level officers – The Board can decide on thetransfer and postings of these DASS cadre officers – Similar Boardcan also be formed for DANICS officers – In the interest of goodgovernance and smooth Governmental function, efforts should bemade by both the Chief Minister as well as the LG for a harmoniousworking relation – (Per Ashok Bhushan, J.)(Partly Dissenting) –Entry 41 of List II of the Seventh Schedule is not available to theLegislative Assembly of GNCTD – Having held so, there is nooccasion to exercise any Executive power with regard to “Services”by the GNCTD, since the Executive power of the GNCTD as perArt.239AA(4) extend in relation to matters with respect to whichLegislative Assembly has power to make laws – With regard to“Services” GNCTD can exercise only those Executive powers, whichcan be exercised by it under any law framed by the Parliament or itmay exercise those Executive powers, which have been delegatedto it – Constitution of India – Art.239AA – Indian AdministrativeServices (Cadre) Rules, 1954 – r.2(c). Constitution of India – Seventh Schedule, List II, Entry 2 –Whether the exclusion of the jurisdiction of the Anti-CorruptionBranch (ACB) of the NCTD to investigate offences committed underthe Prevention of Corruption Act by the officials of the CentralGovernment and limiting the jurisdiction of the ACB to the employees of the GNCTD alone is legal – Held: ACB is not empowered toinvestigate into the offences of Central Government employees underthe Prevention of Corruption Act – Such investigation is carriedout by CBI – Therefore, it obviates the duality and conflict ofjurisdiction as well – As per Notifications dated 23.7.2014 and21.5.2015, the jurisdiction of ACB is limited to the employees ofGNCTD only – Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 – s.2(s) –Prevention of Corruption Act, 1947.Constitution of India – Seventh Schedule, List II, Entry 2 –Term ‘police’ occurring therein – Meaning of – Held: It is a settledprinciple that legislative entries are to be interpreted in a broadand liberal manner consistent with imputing to them the widestamplitude and as including all ancillary and subsidiary matters –The scope of the term ‘Police’ as occurring in Entry 2 of List IIcannot, therefore, be artificially restricted or limited to onlyconstitution of the Police force, but would take within its fold thelegislative (and, therefore, executive) power to exercise supervisionand control over the functioning of the Police so constituted,including by way of issuance of executive directions delineatingthe powers, functions and jurisdiction of different wings/sectionsof the Police – Entry 2 List II would also include the determinationas to the nature and scope of investigations to be done by the Police– Therefore, while establishing the ACB as a Police Station, it wouldbe permissible to circumscribe and limit the investigation sphere ofthe ACB.Constitution of India – Seventh Schedule, List II, Entry 1 –Notification dated 23.7.2014 and 21.5.2015 – By these Notifications,the jurisdiction of ACB was limited to the employees of GNCTD –Validity of these notifications challenged on the ground that s.2(s)empowers the State Government to notify a police station and theimpugned notification was issued by the Central Government andpost 69 th Amendment, the Central Government is not the StateGovernment for exercising power under s.2(s) – Held: No doubt,s.2(s) of the Cr.P.C. contemplates establishment of the police stationby the State Government – However, the Cr.P.C. also lays down theprocedure for making arrest, conducting investigation and submittingfinal reports – It does not contain any provision which prescribeswhat offences would be investigated by which police force – Theseprovisions do not provide how parallel jurisdiction of two policestations is to be demarcated – In fact, parallel jurisdiction toinvestigate is not contemplated by Cr.P.C. as that would result inchaos and anarchy and would frustrate the very purpose ofinvestigation – Therefore, the Government which has competenceover Entry 2 List II would have power to segregate and demarcatethe jurisdiction to investigate as between two police forces – Thus,the impugned notifications are valid – This conclusion becomesinevitable when Cr.P.C. is read with the Delhi Police Act, 1978 andother cognate enactments – Entry 1 of List II, subject matter whereofis ‘public order’, also stands excluded from the purview of GNCTDand is the exclusive domain of the Parliament/ Central Executive –The term ‘public order’ includes cognizance of offences, search,seizure and arrest, followed by registration of reports of offences(FIRs), investigation, prosecution, trial and in the event ofconviction, execution of sentences as well – All these aspects are tobe construed conjointly – Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 – s.2(s)– Interpretation of Statutes.Commission of Inquiry Act, 1952 – s.2(a) – Whether theGNCTD is an ‘appropriate Government’ under the Commission ofInquiry Act, 1952 – Held: s.3(8) of the General Clauses (GC) Actdefines Central Government – s.3(60) of the GC Act, on the otherhand, defines State Government – The GC Act also defines‘Government’, ‘State’ and ‘Union Territory’ – No doubt, definitionof State as contained in s.3(58) includes Union Territory – In respectof Union Territory, the State Government would mean the CentralGovernment – The expression ‘State Government’ occurring in s.2(a)of the COI Act which defines ‘Appropriate Government’ would notmean GNCTD, a Union Territory – General Clauses Act –ss.3(8) and 3(60).Electricity Act, 2003 – s.108 – Whether under s.108 of theElectricity Act, 2003 and under s.12 of the Delhi Electricity ReformsAct, 2000, the power to issue directions to the State Commission iswith the GNCTD – Held: Under s.2(5)(b) of the Electricity Act, 2003,Appropriate Government is the State Government having jurisdictionunder this Act in all those cases which do not come within the domainof ‘Central Government’ – Insofar as NCTD is concerned, it hasits own Commission, namely, DERC – DER Act also stipulates powersof Government in Part IV thereof – General powers of theGovernment, inter alia, include giving directions to the DERC inmatters of policy involving public interest, as the Government mayissue from time to time – These powers are akin to the powers givenunder s.108 of the Electricity Act, 2003 – Insofar as DER Act isconcerned, it is an enactment enacted by Legislative Assembly ofNCTD – It operates within the NCTD – Under this Act, DelhiGovernment has power to issue directions to the DERC in mattersof policies involving public interest – When such powers areconferred specifically to Delhi Government under DER Act, it cannotbe said that insofar as s.108 of the Electricity Act, 2003 is concerned,the expression ‘State Government’ therein would mean the CentralGovernment – Delhi Electricity Reforms Act, 2000 – s.12.Stamp Act, 1899 – Whether the GNCTD had the power torevise the minimum rates of Agricultural Land (Circle Rates) underthe provisions of Stamp Act, 1899 – GNCTD issued the notificationdated August 4, 2015 revising the rates of Agricultural Land (CircleRates) under the provisions of Indian Stamp Act, 1899 and DelhiStamp (Prevention of Under-Valuation of Instruments) Rules, 2007– Before issuing this notification, matter was not placed before theLG for his views or concurrence – Held: Notification dated August4, 2015 revising the rates of agricultural land (circle rates) istraceable to Entry 63 of List II and not to Entry 18 of List II – Saidnotification is issued under the provisions of 1899 Act and 2007Rules – Circle rates are fixed for the purpose of payment of stampduty – Therefore, they do not pertain to ‘land’ namely rights in orover land, land tenures etc. or transfer of alienation of agriculturalland etc. – Stamp duty is not a duty on instrument but it is in realitya duty on transfer of property – In that sense, the occasion for levyof stamp duty is the document which is executed as distinguishedfrom the transaction which is embodied in the document – However,even when the executive wing of Delhi Government takes a decision,the LG is also empowered to form its opinion ‘on any matter’ whichmay be different from the decision taken by his Ministers – Anymatter does not mean each and ‘every matter’ or ‘every triflingmatter’ but only those rare and exceptional matters where thedifference is so fundamental to the governance of the Union Territorythat it deserved to be escalated to the President – Therefore, the LGis not expected to differ routinely with the decision of Council ofMinister – At the same time, the proviso recognises that there maybe contingencies where LG and his Ministers may differ – In suchcircumstances, LG is supposed to refer the matter to the Presidentfor decision and act according to the decision given thereon by thePresident – It means that final say, in case of difference betweenLG and Council of Ministers, is that of the President – Such a schemeof things clearly contemplates that the Council of Ministers issupposed to convey its decisions to the LG to enable the LG to formhis view thereupon – The decision cannot be implemented withoutreferring the same to the LG in the first instance – More pertinently,the decision here touches upon the governance of the UT –Therefore, views of LG should have been taken before issuingNotification dated August 4, 2015 – Constitution of India – Schedule7 List II Entry 63 – Delhi Stamp (Prevention of Under-Valuation ofInstruments) Rules, 2007 – Notification dated August 4, 2015. Constitution of India – Art.239AA, clause (4) and its proviso– LG, role of – Normally, and generally, the LG is expected to honourthe wisdom of the council of ministers – He is also expected to clearthe files expeditiously and is not supposed to sit over it unduly – Heis under duty to bear in mind expediency and urgency of the subjectmatter of the decisions taken by the GNCTD, where ever situationso demands – That in fact is the facet of good governance –Likewise, the executive is also expected to give due deference to theunique nature of the role assigned to the LG in the Constitutionalscheme – By and large, it demands a mutual respect between thetwo organs – Both should realise that they are to serve the peopleof NCTD – Mutual cooperation, thus, becomes essential for theeffective working of the system. Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 – s.24 – Power to appointthe Special Public Prosecutor – Whether it is the LG or the GNCTDwhich has the power to appoint the Special Public Prosecutor unders.24, Cr.PC. – Held: Special Public Prosecutor is appointed as perthe provisions of s.24(8) of Cr.P.C. which is to the effect that powerto appoint Special Public Prosecutor is conferred both upon theCentral Government and the State Government – Insofar as NCTDis concerned, the ‘State Government’ means the LG for the purposesof s.24(8) of Cr.P.C. – In respect of Entries 1 and 2 of List III, theGNCTD has legislative competence under Art.239AA of theConstitution and that the LG under Art.239AA(4) of the Constitutionshall act on the aid and advice of the Council of Ministers –Constitution of India – Art.239AA",

Prevention of Corruption Act by the officials of the CentralGovernment and limiting the jurisdiction of the ACB to the employees of the GNCTD alone is legal – Held: ACB is not empowered toinvestigate into the offences of Central Government employees underthe Prevention of Corruption Act – Such investigation is carriedout by CBI – Therefore, it obviates the duality and conflict ofjurisdiction as well – As per Notifications dated 23.7.2014 and21.5.2015, the jurisdiction of ACB is limited to the employees ofGNCTD only – Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 – s.2(s) –Prevention of Corruption Act, 1947.Constitution of India – Seventh Schedule, List II, Entry 2 –Term ‘police’ occurring therein – Meaning of – Held: It is a settledprinciple that legislative entries are to be interpreted in a broadand liberal manner consistent with imputing to them the widestamplitude and as including all ancillary and subsidiary matters –The scope of the term ‘Police’ as occurring in Entry 2 of List IIcannot, therefore, be artificially restricted or limited to onlyconstitution of the Police force, but would take within its fold thelegislative (and, therefore, executive) power to exercise supervisionand control over the functioning of the Police so constituted,including by way of issuance of executive directions delineatingthe powers, functions and jurisdiction of different wings/sectionsof the Police – Entry 2 List II would also include the determinationas to the nature and scope of investigations to be done by the Police– Therefore, while establishing the ACB as a Police Station, it wouldbe permissible to circumscribe and limit the investigation sphere ofthe ACB.Constitution of India – Seventh Schedule, List II, Entry 1 –Notification dated 23.7.2014 and 21.5.2015 – By these Notifications,the jurisdiction of ACB was limited to the employees of GNCTD –Validity of these notifications challenged on the ground that s.2(s)empowers the State Government to notify a police station and theimpugned notification was issued by the Central Government andpost 69 th Amendment, the Central Government is not the StateGovernment for exercising power under s.2(s) – Held: No doubt,s.2(s) of the Cr.P.C. contemplates establishment of the police stationby the State Government – However, the Cr.P.C. also lays down theprocedure for making arrest, conducting investigation and submittingfinal reports – It does not contain any provision which prescribeswhat offences would be investigated by which police force – Theseprovisions do not provide how parallel jurisdiction of two policestations is to be demarcated – In fact, parallel jurisdiction toinvestigate is not contemplated by Cr.P.C. as that would result inchaos and anarchy and would frustrate the very purpose ofinvestigation – Therefore, the Government which has competenceover Entry 2 List II would have power to segregate and demarcatethe jurisdiction to investigate as between two police forces – Thus,the impugned notifications are valid – This conclusion becomesinevitable when Cr.P.C. is read with the Delhi Police Act, 1978 andother cognate enactments – Entry 1 of List II, subject matter whereofis ‘public order’, also stands excluded from the purview of GNCTDand is the exclusive domain of the Parliament/ Central Executive –The term ‘public order’ includes cognizance of offences, search,seizure and arrest, followed by registration of reports of offences(FIRs), investigation, prosecution, trial and in the event ofconviction, execution of sentences as well – All these aspects are tobe construed conjointly – Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 – s.2(s)– Interpretation of Statutes.Commission of Inquiry Act, 1952 – s.2(a) – Whether theGNCTD is an ‘appropriate Government’ under the Commission ofInquiry Act, 1952 – Held: s.3(8) of the General Clauses (GC) Actdefines Central Government – s.3(60) of the GC Act, on the otherhand, defines State Government – The GC Act also defines‘Government’, ‘State’ and ‘Union Territory’ – No doubt, definitionof State as contained in s.3(58) includes Union Territory – In respectof Union Territory, the State Government would mean the CentralGovernment – The expression ‘State Government’ occurring in s.2(a)of the COI Act which defines ‘Appropriate Government’ would notmean GNCTD, a Union Territory – General Clauses Act –ss.3(8) and 3(60).Electricity Act, 2003 – s.108 – Whether under s.108 of theElectricity Act, 2003 and under s.12 of the Delhi Electricity ReformsAct, 2000, the power to issue directions to the State Commission iswith the GNCTD – Held: Under s.2(5)(b) of the Electricity Act, 2003,Appropriate Government is the State Government having jurisdictionunder this Act in all those cases which do not come within the domainof ‘Central Government’ – Insofar as NCTD is concerned, it hasits own Commission, namely, DERC – DER Act also stipulates powersof Government in Part IV thereof – General powers of theGovernment, inter alia, include giving directions to the DERC inmatters of policy involving public interest, as the Government mayissue from time to time – These powers are akin to the powers givenunder s.108 of the Electricity Act, 2003 – Insofar as DER Act isconcerned, it is an enactment enacted by Legislative Assembly ofNCTD – It operates within the NCTD – Under this Act, DelhiGovernment has power to issue directions to the DERC in mattersof policies involving public interest – When such powers areconferred specifically to Delhi Government under DER Act, it cannotbe said that insofar as s.108 of the Electricity Act, 2003 is concerned,the expression ‘State Government’ therein would mean the CentralGovernment – Delhi Electricity Reforms Act, 2000 – s.12.Stamp Act, 1899 – Whether the GNCTD had the power torevise the minimum rates of Agricultural Land (Circle Rates) underthe provisions of Stamp Act, 1899 – GNCTD issued the notificationdated August 4, 2015 revising the rates of Agricultural Land (CircleRates) under the provisions of Indian Stamp Act, 1899 and DelhiStamp (Prevention of Under-Valuation of Instruments) Rules, 2007– Before issuing this notification, matter was not placed before theLG for his views or concurrence – Held: Notification dated August4, 2015 revising the rates of agricultural land (circle rates) istraceable to Entry 63 of List II and not to Entry 18 of List II – Saidnotification is issued under the provisions of 1899 Act and 2007Rules – Circle rates are fixed for the purpose of payment of stampduty – Therefore, they do not pertain to ‘land’ namely rights in orover land, land tenures etc. or transfer of alienation of agriculturalland etc. – Stamp duty is not a duty on instrument but it is in realitya duty on transfer of property – In that sense, the occasion for levyof stamp duty is the document which is executed as distinguishedfrom the transaction which is embodied in the document – However,even when the executive wing of Delhi Government takes a decision,the LG is also empowered to form its opinion ‘on any matter’ whichmay be different from the decision taken by his Ministers – Anymatter does not mean each and ‘every matter’ or ‘every triflingmatter’ but only those rare and exceptional matters where thedifference is so fundamental to the governance of the Union Territorythat it deserved to be escalated to the President – Therefore, the LGis not expected to differ routinely with the decision of Council ofMinister – At the same time, the proviso recognises that there maybe contingencies where LG and his Ministers may differ – In suchcircumstances, LG is supposed to refer the matter to the Presidentfor decision and act according to the decision given thereon by thePresident – It means that final say, in case of difference betweenLG and Council of Ministers, is that of the President – Such a schemeof things clearly contemplates that the Council of Ministers issupposed to convey its decisions to the LG to enable the LG to formhis view thereupon – The decision cannot be implemented withoutreferring the same to the LG in the first instance – More pertinently,the decision here touches upon the governance of the UT –Therefore, views of LG should have been taken before issuingNotification dated August 4, 2015 – Constitution of India – Schedule7 List II Entry 63 – Delhi Stamp (Prevention of Under-Valuation ofInstruments) Rules, 2007 – Notification dated August 4, 2015. Constitution of India – Art.239AA, clause (4) and its proviso– LG, role of – Normally, and generally, the LG is expected to honourthe wisdom of the council of ministers – He is also expected to clearthe files expeditiously and is not supposed to sit over it unduly – Heis under duty to bear in mind expediency and urgency of the subjectmatter of the decisions taken by the GNCTD, where ever situationso demands – That in fact is the facet of good governance –Likewise, the executive is also expected to give due deference to theunique nature of the role assigned to the LG in the Constitutionalscheme – By and large, it demands a mutual respect between thetwo organs – Both should realise that they are to serve the peopleof NCTD – Mutual cooperation, thus, becomes essential for theeffective working of the system. Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 – s.24 – Power to appointthe Special Public Prosecutor – Whether it is the LG or the GNCTDwhich has the power to appoint the Special Public Prosecutor unders.24, Cr.PC. – Held: Special Public Prosecutor is appointed as perthe provisions of s.24(8) of Cr.P.C. which is to the effect that powerto appoint Special Public Prosecutor is conferred both upon theCentral Government and the State Government – Insofar as NCTDis concerned, the ‘State Government’ means the LG for the purposesof s.24(8) of Cr.P.C. – In respect of Entries 1 and 2 of List III, theGNCTD has legislative competence under Art.239AA of theConstitution and that the LG under Art.239AA(4) of the Constitutionshall act on the aid and advice of the Council of Ministers –Constitution of India – Art.239AA",

        "HeadNote": "Constitution of India – Seventh Schedule, List II, Entry 41 –Exclusion of ‘Services’ relatable to Entry 41 of List II of the SeventhSchedule from the legislative and executive domain of the NCTD,by Notification dated May 21, 2015 – Validity of, challenged – Thesaid Notification in respect of ‘services’ mentions about UnionTerritory cadre consisting of Indian Administrative Service andIndian Police Service Personnel – The notification also refers toDANICS and DANIPS – All these services are administered byCentral Government through Ministry of Home Affairs – Insofar asallocation of personnel belonging to these services is concerned, itis the Central Government through Ministry of Home Affairs whichhas to pass the necessary orders – Similarly, Central Government isempowered to transfer such personnel from one Union Territory toother – Claim of GNCTD is that it has control over these personnelafter they are allocated to NCTD – However, claim of Union ofIndia is that it comes within the discretionary powers of theLieutenant Governor (LG) as the subject matter is not covered byEntry 41 of List II – Held: (Per A.K. Sikri, J.) – Entry 41 of List IIdeals with ‘State Public Services’ and ‘State Public ServiceCommission’ – It is undisputed that State Public Service Commissiondoes not exist in NCTD – When dealing with All India Services andDANICS Services etc., it is also doubtful to mention it as State PublicService – GNCTD has endeavoured to assume the executive powerin respect of ‘services’ by relying upon Entry 41 of List II, whichmay be doubtful – That situation may give discretionary powers tothe LG – On the other hand, it also cannot be said that once themanpower is allocated to Union Territory of Delhi, the GNCTDshould not have any power to deal with such employees – In such ascenario, and to avoid any conflict of exercise of powers betweenthe LG on the one hand and the Council of Ministers with Chief Minister as Head on the other hand, for the smooth functioning ofthe system, just and fair mechanism to be carved out – The transfersand postings of Secretaries, HODs and other officers in the scaleof Joint Secretary to the Government of India and above can bedone by the LG and the file submitted to him directly – For otherlevels, including DANICS officers, the files can be routed throughthe Chief Minister to the LG – In case of difference of opinionbetween the LG and the Chief Minister, the view of the LG wouldprevail and the Ministry of Home Affairs would issue a suitablenotification in that regard – However, for Grade IV, III, II and IDASS officials, there is an existing delegation of powers where forGrades IV and III, all transfers and postings are done by theSecretary (Services); for Grades II and I, the transfers and postingsare done by the Chief Secretary – For greater transparency, a CivilServices Board can be formed which can be headed by the Secretary(Services) for Grades IV and III officials; by the Chief Secretaryfor Grades II and I level officers – The Board can decide on thetransfer and postings of these DASS cadre officers – Similar Boardcan also be formed for DANICS officers – In the interest of goodgovernance and smooth Governmental function, efforts should bemade by both the Chief Minister as well as the LG for a harmoniousworking relation – (Per Ashok Bhushan, J.)(Partly Dissenting) –Entry 41 of List II of the Seventh Schedule is not available to theLegislative Assembly of GNCTD – Having held so, there is nooccasion to exercise any Executive power with regard to “Services”by the GNCTD, since the Executive power of the GNCTD as perArt.239AA(4) extend in relation to matters with respect to whichLegislative Assembly has power to make laws – With regard to“Services” GNCTD can exercise only those Executive powers, whichcan be exercised by it under any law framed by the Parliament or itmay exercise those Executive powers, which have been delegatedto it – Constitution of India – Art.239AA – Indian AdministrativeServices (Cadre) Rules, 1954 – r.2(c). Constitution of India – Seventh Schedule, List II, Entry 2 –Whether the exclusion of the jurisdiction of the Anti-CorruptionBranch (ACB) of the NCTD to investigate offences committed underthe Prevention of Corruption Act by the officials of the CentralGovernment and limiting the jurisdiction of the ACB to the employees of the GNCTD alone is legal – Held: ACB is not empowered toinvestigate into the offences of Central Government employees underthe Prevention of Corruption Act – Such investigation is carriedout by CBI – Therefore, it obviates the duality and conflict ofjurisdiction as well – As per Notifications dated 23.7.2014 and21.5.2015, the jurisdiction of ACB is limited to the employees ofGNCTD only – Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 – s.2(s) –Prevention of Corruption Act, 1947.Constitution of India – Seventh Schedule, List II, Entry 2 –Term ‘police’ occurring therein – Meaning of – Held: It is a settledprinciple that legislative entries are to be interpreted in a broadand liberal manner consistent with imputing to them the widestamplitude and as including all ancillary and subsidiary matters –The scope of the term ‘Police’ as occurring in Entry 2 of List IIcannot, therefore, be artificially restricted or limited to onlyconstitution of the Police force, but would take within its fold thelegislative (and, therefore, executive) power to exercise supervisionand control over the functioning of the Police so constituted,including by way of issuance of executive directions delineatingthe powers, functions and jurisdiction of different wings/sectionsof the Police – Entry 2 List II would also include the determinationas to the nature and scope of investigations to be done by the Police– Therefore, while establishing the ACB as a Police Station, it wouldbe permissible to circumscribe and limit the investigation sphere ofthe ACB.Constitution of India – Seventh Schedule, List II, Entry 1 –Notification dated 23.7.2014 and 21.5.2015 – By these Notifications,the jurisdiction of ACB was limited to the employees of GNCTD –Validity of these notifications challenged on the ground that s.2(s)empowers the State Government to notify a police station and theimpugned notification was issued by the Central Government andpost 69 th Amendment, the Central Government is not the StateGovernment for exercising power under s.2(s) – Held: No doubt,s.2(s) of the Cr.P.C. contemplates establishment of the police stationby the State Government – However, the Cr.P.C. also lays down theprocedure for making arrest, conducting investigation and submittingfinal reports – It does not contain any provision which prescribeswhat offences would be investigated by which police force – Theseprovisions do not provide how parallel jurisdiction of two policestations is to be demarcated – In fact, parallel jurisdiction toinvestigate is not contemplated by Cr.P.C. as that would result inchaos and anarchy and would frustrate the very purpose ofinvestigation – Therefore, the Government which has competenceover Entry 2 List II would have power to segregate and demarcatethe jurisdiction to investigate as between two police forces – Thus,the impugned notifications are valid – This conclusion becomesinevitable when Cr.P.C. is read with the Delhi Police Act, 1978 andother cognate enactments – Entry 1 of List II, subject matter whereofis ‘public order’, also stands excluded from the purview of GNCTDand is the exclusive domain of the Parliament/ Central Executive –The term ‘public order’ includes cognizance of offences, search,seizure and arrest, followed by registration of reports of offences(FIRs), investigation, prosecution, trial and in the event ofconviction, execution of sentences as well – All these aspects are tobe construed conjointly – Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 – s.2(s)– Interpretation of Statutes.Commission of Inquiry Act, 1952 – s.2(a) – Whether theGNCTD is an ‘appropriate Government’ under the Commission ofInquiry Act, 1952 – Held: s.3(8) of the General Clauses (GC) Actdefines Central Government – s.3(60) of the GC Act, on the otherhand, defines State Government – The GC Act also defines‘Government’, ‘State’ and ‘Union Territory’ – No doubt, definitionof State as contained in s.3(58) includes Union Territory – In respectof Union Territory, the State Government would mean the CentralGovernment – The expression ‘State Government’ occurring in s.2(a)of the COI Act which defines ‘Appropriate Government’ would notmean GNCTD, a Union Territory – General Clauses Act –ss.3(8) and 3(60).Electricity Act, 2003 – s.108 – Whether under s.108 of theElectricity Act, 2003 and under s.12 of the Delhi Electricity ReformsAct, 2000, the power to issue directions to the State Commission iswith the GNCTD – Held: Under s.2(5)(b) of the Electricity Act, 2003,Appropriate Government is the State Government having jurisdictionunder this Act in all those cases which do not come within the domainof ‘Central Government’ – Insofar as NCTD is concerned, it hasits own Commission, namely, DERC – DER Act also stipulates powersof Government in Part IV thereof – General powers of theGovernment, inter alia, include giving directions to the DERC inmatters of policy involving public interest, as the Government mayissue from time to time – These powers are akin to the powers givenunder s.108 of the Electricity Act, 2003 – Insofar as DER Act isconcerned, it is an enactment enacted by Legislative Assembly ofNCTD – It operates within the NCTD – Under this Act, DelhiGovernment has power to issue directions to the DERC in mattersof policies involving public interest – When such powers areconferred specifically to Delhi Government under DER Act, it cannotbe said that insofar as s.108 of the Electricity Act, 2003 is concerned,the expression ‘State Government’ therein would mean the CentralGovernment – Delhi Electricity Reforms Act, 2000 – s.12.Stamp Act, 1899 – Whether the GNCTD had the power torevise the minimum rates of Agricultural Land (Circle Rates) underthe provisions of Stamp Act, 1899 – GNCTD issued the notificationdated August 4, 2015 revising the rates of Agricultural Land (CircleRates) under the provisions of Indian Stamp Act, 1899 and DelhiStamp (Prevention of Under-Valuation of Instruments) Rules, 2007– Before issuing this notification, matter was not placed before theLG for his views or concurrence – Held: Notification dated August4, 2015 revising the rates of agricultural land (circle rates) istraceable to Entry 63 of List II and not to Entry 18 of List II – Saidnotification is issued under the provisions of 1899 Act and 2007Rules – Circle rates are fixed for the purpose of payment of stampduty – Therefore, they do not pertain to ‘land’ namely rights in orover land, land tenures etc. or transfer of alienation of agriculturalland etc. – Stamp duty is not a duty on instrument but it is in realitya duty on transfer of property – In that sense, the occasion for levyof stamp duty is the document which is executed as distinguishedfrom the transaction which is embodied in the document – However,even when the executive wing of Delhi Government takes a decision,the LG is also empowered to form its opinion ‘on any matter’ whichmay be different from the decision taken by his Ministers – Anymatter does not mean each and ‘every matter’ or ‘every triflingmatter’ but only those rare and exceptional matters where thedifference is so fundamental to the governance of the Union Territorythat it deserved to be escalated to the President – Therefore, the LGis not expected to differ routinely with the decision of Council ofMinister – At the same time, the proviso recognises that there maybe contingencies where LG and his Ministers may differ – In suchcircumstances, LG is supposed to refer the matter to the Presidentfor decision and act according to the decision given thereon by thePresident – It means that final say, in case of difference betweenLG and Council of Ministers, is that of the President – Such a schemeof things clearly contemplates that the Council of Ministers issupposed to convey its decisions to the LG to enable the LG to formhis view thereupon – The decision cannot be implemented withoutreferring the same to the LG in the first instance – More pertinently,the decision here touches upon the governance of the UT –Therefore, views of LG should have been taken before issuingNotification dated August 4, 2015 – Constitution of India – Schedule7 List II Entry 63 – Delhi Stamp (Prevention of Under-Valuation ofInstruments) Rules, 2007 – Notification dated August 4, 2015. Constitution of India – Art.239AA, clause (4) and its proviso– LG, role of – Normally, and generally, the LG is expected to honourthe wisdom of the council of ministers – He is also expected to clearthe files expeditiously and is not supposed to sit over it unduly – Heis under duty to bear in mind expediency and urgency of the subjectmatter of the decisions taken by the GNCTD, where ever situationso demands – That in fact is the facet of good governance –Likewise, the executive is also expected to give due deference to theunique nature of the role assigned to the LG in the Constitutionalscheme – By and large, it demands a mutual respect between thetwo organs – Both should realise that they are to serve the peopleof NCTD – Mutual cooperation, thus, becomes essential for theeffective working of the system. Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 – s.24 – Power to appointthe Special Public Prosecutor – Whether it is the LG or the GNCTDwhich has the power to appoint the Special Public Prosecutor unders.24, Cr.PC. – Held: Special Public Prosecutor is appointed as perthe provisions of s.24(8) of Cr.P.C. which is to the effect that powerto appoint Special Public Prosecutor is conferred both upon theCentral Government and the State Government – Insofar as NCTDis concerned, the ‘State Government’ means the LG for the purposesof s.24(8) of Cr.P.C. – In respect of Entries 1 and 2 of List III, theGNCTD has legislative competence under Art.239AA of theConstitution and that the LG under Art.239AA(4) of the Constitutionshall act on the aid and advice of the Council of Ministers –Constitution of India – Art.239AA",

Sikri, J.) – Entry 41 of List IIdeals with ‘State Public Services’ and ‘State Public ServiceCommission’ – It is undisputed that State Public Service Commissiondoes not exist in NCTD – When dealing with All India Services andDANICS Services etc., it is also doubtful to mention it as State PublicService – GNCTD has endeavoured to assume the executive powerin respect of ‘services’ by relying upon Entry 41 of List II, whichmay be doubtful – That situation may give discretionary powers tothe LG – On the other hand, it also cannot be said that once themanpower is allocated to Union Territory of Delhi, the GNCTDshould not have any power to deal with such employees – In such ascenario, and to avoid any conflict of exercise of powers betweenthe LG on the one hand and the Council of Ministers with Chief Minister as Head on the other hand, for the smooth functioning ofthe system, just and fair mechanism to be carved out – The transfersand postings of Secretaries, HODs and other officers in the scaleof Joint Secretary to the Government of India and above can bedone by the LG and the file submitted to him directly – For otherlevels, including DANICS officers, the files can be routed throughthe Chief Minister to the LG – In case of difference of opinionbetween the LG and the Chief Minister, the view of the LG wouldprevail and the Ministry of Home Affairs would issue a suitablenotification in that regard – However, for Grade IV, III, II and IDASS officials, there is an existing delegation of powers where forGrades IV and III, all transfers and postings are done by theSecretary (Services); for Grades II and I, the transfers and postingsare done by the Chief Secretary – For greater transparency, a CivilServices Board can be formed which can be headed by the Secretary(Services) for Grades IV and III officials; by the Chief Secretaryfor Grades II and I level officers – The Board can decide on thetransfer and postings of these DASS cadre officers – Similar Boardcan also be formed for DANICS officers – In the interest of goodgovernance and smooth Governmental function, efforts should bemade by both the Chief Minister as well as the LG for a harmoniousworking relation – (Per Ashok Bhushan, J.)(Partly Dissenting) –Entry 41 of List II of the Seventh Schedule is not available to theLegislative Assembly of GNCTD – Having held so, there is nooccasion to exercise any Executive power with regard to “Services”by the GNCTD, since the Executive power of the GNCTD as perArt.239AA(4) extend in relation to matters with respect to whichLegislative Assembly has power to make laws – With regard to“Services” GNCTD can exercise only those Executive powers, whichcan be exercised by it under any law framed by the Parliament or itmay exercise those Executive powers, which have been delegatedto it – Constitution of India – Art.239AA – Indian AdministrativeServices (Cadre) Rules, 1954 – r.2(c). Constitution of India – Seventh Schedule, List II, Entry 2 –Whether the exclusion of the jurisdiction of the Anti-CorruptionBranch (ACB) of the NCTD to investigate offences committed underthe Prevention of Corruption Act by the officials of the CentralGovernment and limiting the jurisdiction of the ACB to the employees of the GNCTD alone is legal – Held: ACB is not empowered toinvestigate into the offences of Central Government employees underthe Prevention of Corruption Act – Such investigation is carriedout by CBI – Therefore, it obviates the duality and conflict ofjurisdiction as well – As per Notifications dated 23.7.2014 and21.5.2015, the jurisdiction of ACB is limited to the employees ofGNCTD only – Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 – s.2(s) –Prevention of Corruption Act, 1947.Constitution of India – Seventh Schedule, List II, Entry 2 –Term ‘police’ occurring therein – Meaning of – Held: It is a settledprinciple that legislative entries are to be interpreted in a broadand liberal manner consistent with imputing to them the widestamplitude and as including all ancillary and subsidiary matters –The scope of the term ‘Police’ as occurring in Entry 2 of List IIcannot, therefore, be artificially restricted or limited to onlyconstitution of the Police force, but would take within its fold thelegislative (and, therefore, executive) power to exercise supervisionand control over the functioning of the Police so constituted,including by way of issuance of executive directions delineatingthe powers, functions and jurisdiction of different wings/sectionsof the Police – Entry 2 List II would also include the determinationas to the nature and scope of investigations to be done by the Police– Therefore, while establishing the ACB as a Police Station, it wouldbe permissible to circumscribe and limit the investigation sphere ofthe ACB.Constitution of India – Seventh Schedule, List II, Entry 1 –Notification dated 23.7.2014 and 21.5.2015 – By these Notifications,the jurisdiction of ACB was limited to the employees of GNCTD –Validity of these notifications challenged on the ground that s.2(s)empowers the State Government to notify a police station and theimpugned notification was issued by the Central Government andpost 69 th Amendment, the Central Government is not the StateGovernment for exercising power under s.2(s) – Held: No doubt,s.2(s) of the Cr.P.C. contemplates establishment of the police stationby the State Government – However, the Cr.P.C. also lays down theprocedure for making arrest, conducting investigation and submittingfinal reports – It does not contain any provision which prescribeswhat offences would be investigated by which police force – Theseprovisions do not provide how parallel jurisdiction of two policestations is to be demarcated – In fact, parallel jurisdiction toinvestigate is not contemplated by Cr.P.C. as that would result inchaos and anarchy and would frustrate the very purpose ofinvestigation – Therefore, the Government which has competenceover Entry 2 List II would have power to segregate and demarcatethe jurisdiction to investigate as between two police forces – Thus,the impugned notifications are valid – This conclusion becomesinevitable when Cr.P.C. is read with the Delhi Police Act, 1978 andother cognate enactments – Entry 1 of List II, subject matter whereofis ‘public order’, also stands excluded from the purview of GNCTDand is the exclusive domain of the Parliament/ Central Executive –The term ‘public order’ includes cognizance of offences, search,seizure and arrest, followed by registration of reports of offences(FIRs), investigation, prosecution, trial and in the event ofconviction, execution of sentences as well – All these aspects are tobe construed conjointly – Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 – s.2(s)– Interpretation of Statutes.Commission of Inquiry Act, 1952 – s.2(a) – Whether theGNCTD is an ‘appropriate Government’ under the Commission ofInquiry Act, 1952 – Held: s.3(8) of the General Clauses (GC) Actdefines Central Government – s.3(60) of the GC Act, on the otherhand, defines State Government – The GC Act also defines‘Government’, ‘State’ and ‘Union Territory’ – No doubt, definitionof State as contained in s.3(58) includes Union Territory – In respectof Union Territory, the State Government would mean the CentralGovernment – The expression ‘State Government’ occurring in s.2(a)of the COI Act which defines ‘Appropriate Government’ would notmean GNCTD, a Union Territory – General Clauses Act –ss.3(8) and 3(60).Electricity Act, 2003 – s.108 – Whether under s.108 of theElectricity Act, 2003 and under s.12 of the Delhi Electricity ReformsAct, 2000, the power to issue directions to the State Commission iswith the GNCTD – Held: Under s.2(5)(b) of the Electricity Act, 2003,Appropriate Government is the State Government having jurisdictionunder this Act in all those cases which do not come within the domainof ‘Central Government’ – Insofar as NCTD is concerned, it hasits own Commission, namely, DERC – DER Act also stipulates powersof Government in Part IV thereof – General powers of theGovernment, inter alia, include giving directions to the DERC inmatters of policy involving public interest, as the Government mayissue from time to time – These powers are akin to the powers givenunder s.108 of the Electricity Act, 2003 – Insofar as DER Act isconcerned, it is an enactment enacted by Legislative Assembly ofNCTD – It operates within the NCTD – Under this Act, DelhiGovernment has power to issue directions to the DERC in mattersof policies involving public interest – When such powers areconferred specifically to Delhi Government under DER Act, it cannotbe said that insofar as s.108 of the Electricity Act, 2003 is concerned,the expression ‘State Government’ therein would mean the CentralGovernment – Delhi Electricity Reforms Act, 2000 – s.12.Stamp Act, 1899 – Whether the GNCTD had the power torevise the minimum rates of Agricultural Land (Circle Rates) underthe provisions of Stamp Act, 1899 – GNCTD issued the notificationdated August 4, 2015 revising the rates of Agricultural Land (CircleRates) under the provisions of Indian Stamp Act, 1899 and DelhiStamp (Prevention of Under-Valuation of Instruments) Rules, 2007– Before issuing this notification, matter was not placed before theLG for his views or concurrence – Held: Notification dated August4, 2015 revising the rates of agricultural land (circle rates) istraceable to Entry 63 of List II and not to Entry 18 of List II – Saidnotification is issued under the provisions of 1899 Act and 2007Rules – Circle rates are fixed for the purpose of payment of stampduty – Therefore, they do not pertain to ‘land’ namely rights in orover land, land tenures etc. or transfer of alienation of agriculturalland etc. – Stamp duty is not a duty on instrument but it is in realitya duty on transfer of property – In that sense, the occasion for levyof stamp duty is the document which is executed as distinguishedfrom the transaction which is embodied in the document – However,even when the executive wing of Delhi Government takes a decision,the LG is also empowered to form its opinion ‘on any matter’ whichmay be different from the decision taken by his Ministers – Anymatter does not mean each and ‘every matter’ or ‘every triflingmatter’ but only those rare and exceptional matters where thedifference is so fundamental to the governance of the Union Territorythat it deserved to be escalated to the President – Therefore, the LGis not expected to differ routinely with the decision of Council ofMinister – At the same time, the proviso recognises that there maybe contingencies where LG and his Ministers may differ – In suchcircumstances, LG is supposed to refer the matter to the Presidentfor decision and act according to the decision given thereon by thePresident – It means that final say, in case of difference betweenLG and Council of Ministers, is that of the President – Such a schemeof things clearly contemplates that the Council of Ministers issupposed to convey its decisions to the LG to enable the LG to formhis view thereupon – The decision cannot be implemented withoutreferring the same to the LG in the first instance – More pertinently,the decision here touches upon the governance of the UT –Therefore, views of LG should have been taken before issuingNotification dated August 4, 2015 – Constitution of India – Schedule7 List II Entry 63 – Delhi Stamp (Prevention of Under-Valuation ofInstruments) Rules, 2007 – Notification dated August 4, 2015. Constitution of India – Art.239AA, clause (4) and its proviso– LG, role of – Normally, and generally, the LG is expected to honourthe wisdom of the council of ministers – He is also expected to clearthe files expeditiously and is not supposed to sit over it unduly – Heis under duty to bear in mind expediency and urgency of the subjectmatter of the decisions taken by the GNCTD, where ever situationso demands – That in fact is the facet of good governance –Likewise, the executive is also expected to give due deference to theunique nature of the role assigned to the LG in the Constitutionalscheme – By and large, it demands a mutual respect between thetwo organs – Both should realise that they are to serve the peopleof NCTD – Mutual cooperation, thus, becomes essential for theeffective working of the system. Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 – s.24 – Power to appointthe Special Public Prosecutor – Whether it is the LG or the GNCTDwhich has the power to appoint the Special Public Prosecutor unders.24, Cr.PC. – Held: Special Public Prosecutor is appointed as perthe provisions of s.24(8) of Cr.P.C. which is to the effect that powerto appoint Special Public Prosecutor is conferred both upon theCentral Government and the State Government – Insofar as NCTDis concerned, the ‘State Government’ means the LG for the purposesof s.24(8) of Cr.P.C. – In respect of Entries 1 and 2 of List III, theGNCTD has legislative competence under Art.239AA of theConstitution and that the LG under Art.239AA(4) of the Constitutionshall act on the aid and advice of the Council of Ministers –Constitution of India – Art.239AA",

Prevention of Corruption Act by the officials of the CentralGovernment and limiting the jurisdiction of the ACB to the employees of the GNCTD alone is legal – Held: ACB is not empowered toinvestigate into the offences of Central Government employees underthe Prevention of Corruption Act – Such investigation is carriedout by CBI – Therefore, it obviates the duality and conflict ofjurisdiction as well – As per Notifications dated 23.7.2014 and21.5.2015, the jurisdiction of ACB is limited to the employees ofGNCTD only – Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 – s.2(s) –Prevention of Corruption Act, 1947.Constitution of India – Seventh Schedule, List II, Entry 2 –Term ‘police’ occurring therein – Meaning of – Held: It is a settledprinciple that legislative entries are to be interpreted in a broadand liberal manner consistent with imputing to them the widestamplitude and as including all ancillary and subsidiary matters –The scope of the term ‘Police’ as occurring in Entry 2 of List IIcannot, therefore, be artificially restricted or limited to onlyconstitution of the Police force, but would take within its fold thelegislative (and, therefore, executive) power to exercise supervisionand control over the functioning of the Police so constituted,including by way of issuance of executive directions delineatingthe powers, functions and jurisdiction of different wings/sectionsof the Police – Entry 2 List II would also include the determinationas to the nature and scope of investigations to be done by the Police– Therefore, while establishing the ACB as a Police Station, it wouldbe permissible to circumscribe and limit the investigation sphere ofthe ACB.Constitution of India – Seventh Schedule, List II, Entry 1 –Notification dated 23.7.2014 and 21.5.2015 – By these Notifications,the jurisdiction of ACB was limited to the employees of GNCTD –Validity of these notifications challenged on the ground that s.2(s)empowers the State Government to notify a police station and theimpugned notification was issued by the Central Government andpost 69 th Amendment, the Central Government is not the StateGovernment for exercising power under s.2(s) – Held: No doubt,s.2(s) of the Cr.P.C. contemplates establishment of the police stationby the State Government – However, the Cr.P.C. also lays down theprocedure for making arrest, conducting investigation and submittingfinal reports – It does not contain any provision which prescribeswhat offences would be investigated by which police force – Theseprovisions do not provide how parallel jurisdiction of two policestations is to be demarcated – In fact, parallel jurisdiction toinvestigate is not contemplated by Cr.P.C. as that would result inchaos and anarchy and would frustrate the very purpose ofinvestigation – Therefore, the Government which has competenceover Entry 2 List II would have power to segregate and demarcatethe jurisdiction to investigate as between two police forces – Thus,the impugned notifications are valid – This conclusion becomesinevitable when Cr.P.C. is read with the Delhi Police Act, 1978 andother cognate enactments – Entry 1 of List II, subject matter whereofis ‘public order’, also stands excluded from the purview of GNCTDand is the exclusive domain of the Parliament/ Central Executive –The term ‘public order’ includes cognizance of offences, search,seizure and arrest, followed by registration of reports of offences(FIRs), investigation, prosecution, trial and in the event ofconviction, execution of sentences as well – All these aspects are tobe construed conjointly – Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 – s.2(s)– Interpretation of Statutes.Commission of Inquiry Act, 1952 – s.2(a) – Whether theGNCTD is an ‘appropriate Government’ under the Commission ofInquiry Act, 1952 – Held: s.3(8) of the General Clauses (GC) Actdefines Central Government – s.3(60) of the GC Act, on the otherhand, defines State Government – The GC Act also defines‘Government’, ‘State’ and ‘Union Territory’ – No doubt, definitionof State as contained in s.3(58) includes Union Territory – In respectof Union Territory, the State Government would mean the CentralGovernment – The expression ‘State Government’ occurring in s.2(a)of the COI Act which defines ‘Appropriate Government’ would notmean GNCTD, a Union Territory – General Clauses Act –ss.3(8) and 3(60).Electricity Act, 2003 – s.108 – Whether under s.108 of theElectricity Act, 2003 and under s.12 of the Delhi Electricity ReformsAct, 2000, the power to issue directions to the State Commission iswith the GNCTD – Held: Under s.2(5)(b) of the Electricity Act, 2003,Appropriate Government is the State Government having jurisdictionunder this Act in all those cases which do not come within the domainof ‘Central Government’ – Insofar as NCTD is concerned, it hasits own Commission, namely, DERC – DER Act also stipulates powersof Government in Part IV thereof – General powers of theGovernment, inter alia, include giving directions to the DERC inmatters of policy involving public interest, as the Government mayissue from time to time – These powers are akin to the powers givenunder s.108 of the Electricity Act, 2003 – Insofar as DER Act isconcerned, it is an enactment enacted by Legislative Assembly ofNCTD – It operates within the NCTD – Under this Act, DelhiGovernment has power to issue directions to the DERC in mattersof policies involving public interest – When such powers areconferred specifically to Delhi Government under DER Act, it cannotbe said that insofar as s.108 of the Electricity Act, 2003 is concerned,the expression ‘State Government’ therein would mean the CentralGovernment – Delhi Electricity Reforms Act, 2000 – s.12.Stamp Act, 1899 – Whether the GNCTD had the power torevise the minimum rates of Agricultural Land (Circle Rates) underthe provisions of Stamp Act, 1899 – GNCTD issued the notificationdated August 4, 2015 revising the rates of Agricultural Land (CircleRates) under the provisions of Indian Stamp Act, 1899 and DelhiStamp (Prevention of Under-Valuation of Instruments) Rules, 2007– Before issuing this notification, matter was not placed before theLG for his views or concurrence – Held: Notification dated August4, 2015 revising the rates of agricultural land (circle rates) istraceable to Entry 63 of List II and not to Entry 18 of List II – Saidnotification is issued under the provisions of 1899 Act and 2007Rules – Circle rates are fixed for the purpose of payment of stampduty – Therefore, they do not pertain to ‘land’ namely rights in orover land, land tenures etc. or transfer of alienation of agriculturalland etc. – Stamp duty is not a duty on instrument but it is in realitya duty on transfer of property – In that sense, the occasion for levyof stamp duty is the document which is executed as distinguishedfrom the transaction which is embodied in the document – However,even when the executive wing of Delhi Government takes a decision,the LG is also empowered to form its opinion ‘on any matter’ whichmay be different from the decision taken by his Ministers – Anymatter does not mean each and ‘every matter’ or ‘every triflingmatter’ but only those rare and exceptional matters where thedifference is so fundamental to the governance of the Union Territorythat it deserved to be escalated to the President – Therefore, the LGis not expected to differ routinely with the decision of Council ofMinister – At the same time, the proviso recognises that there maybe contingencies where LG and his Ministers may differ – In suchcircumstances, LG is supposed to refer the matter to the Presidentfor decision and act according to the decision given thereon by thePresident – It means that final say, in case of difference betweenLG and Council of Ministers, is that of the President – Such a schemeof things clearly contemplates that the Council of Ministers issupposed to convey its decisions to the LG to enable the LG to formhis view thereupon – The decision cannot be implemented withoutreferring the same to the LG in the first instance – More pertinently,the decision here touches upon the governance of the UT –Therefore, views of LG should have been taken before issuingNotification dated August 4, 2015 – Constitution of India – Schedule7 List II Entry 63 – Delhi Stamp (Prevention of Under-Valuation ofInstruments) Rules, 2007 – Notification dated August 4, 2015. Constitution of India – Art.239AA, clause (4) and its proviso– LG, role of – Normally, and generally, the LG is expected to honourthe wisdom of the council of ministers – He is also expected to clearthe files expeditiously and is not supposed to sit over it unduly – Heis under duty to bear in mind expediency and urgency of the subjectmatter of the decisions taken by the GNCTD, where ever situationso demands – That in fact is the facet of good governance –Likewise, the executive is also expected to give due deference to theunique nature of the role assigned to the LG in the Constitutionalscheme – By and large, it demands a mutual respect between thetwo organs – Both should realise that they are to serve the peopleof NCTD – Mutual cooperation, thus, becomes essential for theeffective working of the system. Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 – s.24 – Power to appointthe Special Public Prosecutor – Whether it is the LG or the GNCTDwhich has the power to appoint the Special Public Prosecutor unders.24, Cr.PC. – Held: Special Public Prosecutor is appointed as perthe provisions of s.24(8) of Cr.P.C. which is to the effect that powerto appoint Special Public Prosecutor is conferred both upon theCentral Government and the State Government – Insofar as NCTDis concerned, the ‘State Government’ means the LG for the purposesof s.24(8) of Cr.P.C. – In respect of Entries 1 and 2 of List III, theGNCTD has legislative competence under Art.239AA of theConstitution and that the LG under Art.239AA(4) of the Constitutionshall act on the aid and advice of the Council of Ministers –Constitution of India – Art.239AA",

Classificationbetween financial creditor and operational creditor – Whetherdiscriminatory, arbitrary, and violative of Art. 14 – Held: Preservingthe corporate debtor as a going concern, while ensuring maximumrecovery for all creditors being the objective of the Code, financialcreditors are clearly different from operational creditors – Thus,there is an intelligible differentia between the two which has a directrelation to the objects sought to be achieved by the Code – Thus,there is no discrimination – Constitution of India – Art. 14.ss. 3, 3(9)(c), 214(e), 60, 65, 75, 7, 8 and 9 – Notice, hearing,and set-off or counterclaim qua financial debts – Triggering ofinsolvency resolution process by financial creditors and operationalcreditors – Submission that the difference in the triggering processat behest of financial creditors and operational creditors isdiscriminatory and arbitrary – Held: A financial creditor has toprove “default” as opposed to an operational creditor who merely“claims” a right to payment of a liability or obligation in respect ofa debt which may be due – In view thereof, the differentiation in thetriggering of insolvency resolution process by financial creditorsu/s. 7 and by operational creditors u/ss. 8 and 9 becomes clear –Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India (Information Utilities)Regulations, 2017 – Insolvency and Bankruptcy (Application toAdjudicating Authority) Rules, 2016 – Form I. ss. 21, 24, 28 and 30(2)(b) r/w s. 31 – Operational creditors– Right to vote in the committee of creditors – Plea that operationalcreditor do not have even a single vote in committee of creditors –Held: Financial creditors are best equipped to assess viability andfeasibility of the business of the corporate debtor and evaluate thecontents of a resolution plan – On the other hand, operationalcreditors, who provide goods and services, are involved only inrecovering amounts that are paid for such goods and services, andare typically unable to assess viability and feasibility of business –Resolution plan cannot pass muster u/s. 30(2)(b) rw s. 31 unless aminimum payment is made to operational creditors, being not lessthan liquidation value – Regulation 38 strengthens the rights ofoperational creditors by statutorily incorporating the principle offair and equitable dealing of operational creditors’ rights, togetherwith priority in payment over financial creditors – Thus, theoperational creditors are not discriminated against nor Art. 14 hasbeen infracted either on the ground of equals being treated unequallyor on the ground of manifest arbitrariness – Insolvency andBankruptcy Board of India (Insolvency Resolution Process forCorporate Persons) Regulations, 2016 – Regulation 38 –Constitution of India – Art. 14.ss.12A(as amended) and 60 – s. 12A wherein withdrawal ofapplication admitted u/ss 7, 9 or 10, with approval of ninety percent voting shares of the committee of creditors – s. 12A if violativeof Art. 14 – Held: s. 12A is not violative of Art. 14 – ILC Report hasexplained that as all financial creditors have to put their headstogether to allow such withdrawal as, ordinarily, an omnibussettlement involving all creditors ought, ideally, to be entered into –In any case, the figure of ninety per cent, in the absence of anythingfurther to show that it is arbitrary, must pertain to the domain oflegislative policy – Also, if the committee of creditors arbitrarilyrejects a just settlement and/or withdrawal claim, the NCLT, andthereafter, the NCLAT can always set aside such decision u/s. 60 –Insolvency and Bankruptcy (Second Amendment) Act, 2018 –Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India (Insolvency ResolutionProcess for Corporate Persons) Regulations, 2016 – Reg 30A.s. 210 – Private Information Utilities – Evidence providedby private information utilities – Plea that Private Information Utilities not governed by proper norms and evidence of loan defaultin records of such utility not conclusive evidence – Held: Regulations20 and 21 makes it clear that apart from the stringent requirementsas to registration of such utility, the moment information of defaultis received, such information has to be communicated to all partiesand sureties to the debt and an information utility shall expeditiouslyundertake the process of authentication and verification ofinformation – Evidence provided by private information utilities isonly prima facie evidence of default which is rebuttable by thecorporate debtor – Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India(Insolvency Resolution Process for Corporate Persons) Regulations,2016 – Regulations 20 and 21ss. 18, 41, 42 and 28 – Resolution professional – Adjudicatorypower, under the Code and the Regulations – Held: It is clear fromthe Code as well as the Regulations that the resolution professionalhas no adjudicatory powers – Resolution professional is givenadministrative as opposed to quasi-judicial powers – Even whenthe resolution professional is to make a “determination” underRegulation 35A, he is only to apply to the Adjudicating Authorityfor appropriate relief based on the determination made – Thus, theresolution professional is really a facilitator of the resolution process,whose administrative functions are overseen by the committee ofcreditors and by the Adjudicating Authority – Insolvency andBankruptcy Board of India (Insolvency Resolution Process forCorporate Persons) Regulations, 2016 – Regulations 10, 12, 13,14, and 35A.s. 29A(as amended) – Retrospective application – Submissionthat vested rights of erstwhile promoters to participate in the recoveryprocess of a corporate debtor have been impaired by retrospectiveapplication of s. 29A – Held: A statute is not retrospective merelybecause it affects existing rights or merely because a part of therequisites for its action is drawn from a time antecedent to its passing– Resolution applicant has no vested right for consideration orapproval of its resolution plan – By application of s. 29A, no vestedright is taken away – Since a resolution applicant who applies u/s.29A(c) has no vested right to apply for being considered as aresolution applicant, submission cannot be accepted. s. 29A and s.35(1)(f) proviso – s. 29A if restricted tomalfeasance – Submission that s. 29A puts a blanket ban onparticipation of all promoters of corporate debtors, without anymechanism to weed out the unscrupulous as against the efficientmanager but who have not been able to pay off their debts due toother reasons – Held: s. 29A not restricted to malfeasance –Legislative purpose which permeates s. 29A continues to permeatethe Section when it applies not merely to resolution applicants, butto liquidation also.s. 29(A)(c) – One year period in s. 29A – Non-performingasset – Plea that u/s. 29A(c), a person’s account may be classifiedas a non- performing asset even though he is not a wilful defaulter;and that the period of one year referred in clause (c) is whollyarbitrary and without any basis either in rationality or in law –Held: A person is a defaulter when an installment and/or intereston the principal remains overdue for more than three months, afterwhich, its account is declared NPA – During the period of one yearthereafter, this grace period is given to such person to pay off thedebt – If a person is unable to repay a loan taken, in whole or inpart, within this period of one year and three months, he would beineligible to become a resolution applicant – This legislative policycannot be found fault with – Neither can the period of one year befound fault with.ss. 29A(j) and 5(24A) – Related party – Plea that personswho may be relatives of erstwhile promoters are debarred frombecoming a resolution applicant – Held: Persons who act jointly orin concert with others are connected with the business activity ofthe resolution applicant – Similarly, all the categories of personsmentioned in s. 5(24A) show that such persons must be “connected”with the resolution applicant within the meaning of s. 29A(j) – Thus,the said categories of persons who are collectively mentioned underthe caption “relative” obviously need to have a connection with thebusiness activity of the resolution applicant – In the absence ofshowing that such person is “connected” with the business of theactivity of the resolution applicant, such person cannot possibly bedisqualified u/s. 29A(j) – Explanation I clause (ii) to s. 29A(j) makesit clear that if a person is otherwise covered as a “connected person”,this provision would also cover a person who is in management orcontrol of the business of the corporate debtor during the implementation of a resolution plan – Thus, any such person is notindeterminate at all, but is a person who is in the saddle of thebusiness of the corporate debtor either at an anterior point of timeor even during implementation of the resolution plan.s. 29A – Exemption of micro, small and medium enterprisesfrom s. 29A – Justification of – Held: Justified – Rationale forexcluding such industries from the eligibility criteria laid down inss. 29A(c) and 29A(h) is because qua such industries, otherresolution applicants may not be forthcoming, which then willinevitably lead not to resolution, but to liquidation – Micro, Smalland Medium Enterprises Development Act, 2006 – s. 7.s. 53 – Distribution of assets – Submission that in the event ofliquidation, operational creditors would never get anything as theyrank below all other creditors, including other unsecured creditorswho happen to be financial creditors, thus s. 53(1)(f) discriminatoryand arbitrary thus, violative of Art. 14 – Held: s. 53 does not violateArt. 14 – Repayment of financial debts infuses capital into theeconomy inasmuch as banks and financial institutions are able,with the money that has been paid back, to further lend such moneyto other entrepreneurs for their businesses – This rationale createsan intelligible differentia between financial debts and operationaldebts, which are unsecured, which is directly related to the objectsought to be achieved by the Code – So long as there is somelegitimate interest sought to be protected, having relation to theobject sought to be achieved by the statute, Art. 14 does not getinfracted – Constitution of India – Art. 14.Object and reasons for the Code – Explained.Enactment and working of the Code – Explained.Companies Act, 2013: s. 412 – Selection of members oftribunal and appellate tribunal – Plea that appointment of membersof the NCLT and the NCLAT contrary to Madras Bar Association(III)’s case – s. 412 whereby members of the tribunal and appellatetribunal to be selected, two judicial members of the SelectionCommittee get outweighed by three bureaucrats – Held: s. 412 hasbeen amended by the Companies Amendment Act, 2017 – Presentmembers of NCLT and NCLAT have been appointed by the SelectionCommittee, reconstituted in compliance with the direction of thisCourt. Judiciary: NCLAT Bench – Creation of Circuit Benches –Submission that NCLAT Bench has a seat only at New Delhi and iscontrary to the judgment in Madras Bar Association (II) case –Held: In view of the assurance by the Attorney General that CircuitBenches would be established soon, issuance of direction to Unionof India to set up Circuit Benches of the NCLAT within the stipulatedperiod.Constitution of India: Art. 77 – Submission that the tribunals-NCLT and NCLAT are functioning under the wrong Ministry-Ministryof Corporate Affairs, however, as per the Madras Bar Association(I)case the administrative support for all the tribunals should be fromthe Ministry of Law and Justice – Held: Rules of business beingmandatory in nature and having to be followed, are to be followedby the executive branch of the Government – However, this Court isbeing bound by the Madras Bar Association(I), the Union of Indiato follow the judgment, both in letter and spirit.",

Classificationbetween financial creditor and operational creditor – Whetherdiscriminatory, arbitrary, and violative of Art. 14 – Held: Preservingthe corporate debtor as a going concern, while ensuring maximumrecovery for all creditors being the objective of the Code, financialcreditors are clearly different from operational creditors – Thus,there is an intelligible differentia between the two which has a directrelation to the objects sought to be achieved by the Code – Thus,there is no discrimination – Constitution of India – Art. 14.ss. 3, 3(9)(c), 214(e), 60, 65, 75, 7, 8 and 9 – Notice, hearing,and set-off or counterclaim qua financial debts – Triggering ofinsolvency resolution process by financial creditors and operationalcreditors – Submission that the difference in the triggering processat behest of financial creditors and operational creditors isdiscriminatory and arbitrary – Held: A financial creditor has toprove “default” as opposed to an operational creditor who merely“claims” a right to payment of a liability or obligation in respect ofa debt which may be due – In view thereof, the differentiation in thetriggering of insolvency resolution process by financial creditorsu/s. 7 and by operational creditors u/ss. 8 and 9 becomes clear –Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India (Information Utilities)Regulations, 2017 – Insolvency and Bankruptcy (Application toAdjudicating Authority) Rules, 2016 – Form I. ss. 21, 24, 28 and 30(2)(b) r/w s. 31 – Operational creditors– Right to vote in the committee of creditors – Plea that operationalcreditor do not have even a single vote in committee of creditors –Held: Financial creditors are best equipped to assess viability andfeasibility of the business of the corporate debtor and evaluate thecontents of a resolution plan – On the other hand, operationalcreditors, who provide goods and services, are involved only inrecovering amounts that are paid for such goods and services, andare typically unable to assess viability and feasibility of business –Resolution plan cannot pass muster u/s. 30(2)(b) rw s. 31 unless aminimum payment is made to operational creditors, being not lessthan liquidation value – Regulation 38 strengthens the rights ofoperational creditors by statutorily incorporating the principle offair and equitable dealing of operational creditors’ rights, togetherwith priority in payment over financial creditors – Thus, theoperational creditors are not discriminated against nor Art. 14 hasbeen infracted either on the ground of equals being treated unequallyor on the ground of manifest arbitrariness – Insolvency andBankruptcy Board of India (Insolvency Resolution Process forCorporate Persons) Regulations, 2016 – Regulation 38 –Constitution of India – Art. 14.ss.12A(as amended) and 60 – s. 12A wherein withdrawal ofapplication admitted u/ss 7, 9 or 10, with approval of ninety percent voting shares of the committee of creditors – s. 12A if violativeof Art. 14 – Held: s. 12A is not violative of Art. 14 – ILC Report hasexplained that as all financial creditors have to put their headstogether to allow such withdrawal as, ordinarily, an omnibussettlement involving all creditors ought, ideally, to be entered into –In any case, the figure of ninety per cent, in the absence of anythingfurther to show that it is arbitrary, must pertain to the domain oflegislative policy – Also, if the committee of creditors arbitrarilyrejects a just settlement and/or withdrawal claim, the NCLT, andthereafter, the NCLAT can always set aside such decision u/s. 60 –Insolvency and Bankruptcy (Second Amendment) Act, 2018 –Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India (Insolvency ResolutionProcess for Corporate Persons) Regulations, 2016 – Reg 30A.s. 210 – Private Information Utilities – Evidence providedby private information utilities – Plea that Private Information Utilities not governed by proper norms and evidence of loan defaultin records of such utility not conclusive evidence – Held: Regulations20 and 21 makes it clear that apart from the stringent requirementsas to registration of such utility, the moment information of defaultis received, such information has to be communicated to all partiesand sureties to the debt and an information utility shall expeditiouslyundertake the process of authentication and verification ofinformation – Evidence provided by private information utilities isonly prima facie evidence of default which is rebuttable by thecorporate debtor – Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India(Insolvency Resolution Process for Corporate Persons) Regulations,2016 – Regulations 20 and 21ss. 18, 41, 42 and 28 – Resolution professional – Adjudicatorypower, under the Code and the Regulations – Held: It is clear fromthe Code as well as the Regulations that the resolution professionalhas no adjudicatory powers – Resolution professional is givenadministrative as opposed to quasi-judicial powers – Even whenthe resolution professional is to make a “determination” underRegulation 35A, he is only to apply to the Adjudicating Authorityfor appropriate relief based on the determination made – Thus, theresolution professional is really a facilitator of the resolution process,whose administrative functions are overseen by the committee ofcreditors and by the Adjudicating Authority – Insolvency andBankruptcy Board of India (Insolvency Resolution Process forCorporate Persons) Regulations, 2016 – Regulations 10, 12, 13,14, and 35A.s. 29A(as amended) – Retrospective application – Submissionthat vested rights of erstwhile promoters to participate in the recoveryprocess of a corporate debtor have been impaired by retrospectiveapplication of s. 29A – Held: A statute is not retrospective merelybecause it affects existing rights or merely because a part of therequisites for its action is drawn from a time antecedent to its passing– Resolution applicant has no vested right for consideration orapproval of its resolution plan – By application of s. 29A, no vestedright is taken away – Since a resolution applicant who applies u/s.29A(c) has no vested right to apply for being considered as aresolution applicant, submission cannot be accepted. s. 29A and s.35(1)(f) proviso – s. 29A if restricted tomalfeasance – Submission that s. 29A puts a blanket ban onparticipation of all promoters of corporate debtors, without anymechanism to weed out the unscrupulous as against the efficientmanager but who have not been able to pay off their debts due toother reasons – Held: s. 29A not restricted to malfeasance –Legislative purpose which permeates s. 29A continues to permeatethe Section when it applies not merely to resolution applicants, butto liquidation also.s. 29(A)(c) – One year period in s. 29A – Non-performingasset – Plea that u/s. 29A(c), a person’s account may be classifiedas a non- performing asset even though he is not a wilful defaulter;and that the period of one year referred in clause (c) is whollyarbitrary and without any basis either in rationality or in law –Held: A person is a defaulter when an installment and/or intereston the principal remains overdue for more than three months, afterwhich, its account is declared NPA – During the period of one yearthereafter, this grace period is given to such person to pay off thedebt – If a person is unable to repay a loan taken, in whole or inpart, within this period of one year and three months, he would beineligible to become a resolution applicant – This legislative policycannot be found fault with – Neither can the period of one year befound fault with.ss. 29A(j) and 5(24A) – Related party – Plea that personswho may be relatives of erstwhile promoters are debarred frombecoming a resolution applicant – Held: Persons who act jointly orin concert with others are connected with the business activity ofthe resolution applicant – Similarly, all the categories of personsmentioned in s. 5(24A) show that such persons must be “connected”with the resolution applicant within the meaning of s. 29A(j) – Thus,the said categories of persons who are collectively mentioned underthe caption “relative” obviously need to have a connection with thebusiness activity of the resolution applicant – In the absence ofshowing that such person is “connected” with the business of theactivity of the resolution applicant, such person cannot possibly bedisqualified u/s. 29A(j) – Explanation I clause (ii) to s. 29A(j) makesit clear that if a person is otherwise covered as a “connected person”,this provision would also cover a person who is in management orcontrol of the business of the corporate debtor during the implementation of a resolution plan – Thus, any such person is notindeterminate at all, but is a person who is in the saddle of thebusiness of the corporate debtor either at an anterior point of timeor even during implementation of the resolution plan.s. 29A – Exemption of micro, small and medium enterprisesfrom s. 29A – Justification of – Held: Justified – Rationale forexcluding such industries from the eligibility criteria laid down inss. 29A(c) and 29A(h) is because qua such industries, otherresolution applicants may not be forthcoming, which then willinevitably lead not to resolution, but to liquidation – Micro, Smalland Medium Enterprises Development Act, 2006 – s. 7.s. 53 – Distribution of assets – Submission that in the event ofliquidation, operational creditors would never get anything as theyrank below all other creditors, including other unsecured creditorswho happen to be financial creditors, thus s. 53(1)(f) discriminatoryand arbitrary thus, violative of Art. 14 – Held: s. 53 does not violateArt. 14 – Repayment of financial debts infuses capital into theeconomy inasmuch as banks and financial institutions are able,with the money that has been paid back, to further lend such moneyto other entrepreneurs for their businesses – This rationale createsan intelligible differentia between financial debts and operationaldebts, which are unsecured, which is directly related to the objectsought to be achieved by the Code – So long as there is somelegitimate interest sought to be protected, having relation to theobject sought to be achieved by the statute, Art. 14 does not getinfracted – Constitution of India – Art. 14.Object and reasons for the Code – Explained.Enactment and working of the Code – Explained.Companies Act, 2013: s. 412 – Selection of members oftribunal and appellate tribunal – Plea that appointment of membersof the NCLT and the NCLAT contrary to Madras Bar Association(III)’s case – s. 412 whereby members of the tribunal and appellatetribunal to be selected, two

to the domain oflegislative policy – Also, if the committee of creditors arbitrarilyrejects a just settlement and/or withdrawal claim, the NCLT, andthereafter, the NCLAT can always set aside such decision u/s. 60 –Insolvency and Bankruptcy (Second Amendment) Act, 2018 –Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India (Insolvency ResolutionProcess for Corporate Persons) Regulations, 2016 – Reg 30A.s. 210 – Private Information Utilities – Evidence providedby private information utilities – Plea that Private Information Utilities not governed by proper norms and evidence of loan defaultin records of such utility not conclusive evidence – Held: Regulations20 and 21 makes it clear that apart from the stringent requirementsas to registration of such utility, the moment information of defaultis received, such information has to be communicated to all partiesand sureties to the debt and an information utility shall expeditiouslyundertake the process of authentication and verification ofinformation – Evidence provided by private information utilities isonly prima facie evidence of default which is rebuttable by thecorporate debtor – Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India(Insolvency Resolution Process for Corporate Persons) Regulations,2016 – Regulations 20 and 21ss. 18, 41, 42 and 28 – Resolution professional – Adjudicatorypower, under the Code and the Regulations – Held: It is clear fromthe Code as well as the Regulations that the resolution professionalhas no adjudicatory powers – Resolution professional is givenadministrative as opposed to quasi-judicial powers – Even whenthe resolution professional is to make a “determination” underRegulation 35A, he is only to apply to the Adjudicating Authorityfor appropriate relief based on the determination made – Thus, theresolution professional is really a facilitator of the resolution process,whose administrative functions are overseen by the committee ofcreditors and by the Adjudicating Authority – Insolvency andBankruptcy Board of India (Insolvency Resolution Process forCorporate Persons) Regulations, 2016 – Regulations 10, 12, 13,14, and 35A.s. 29A(as amended) – Retrospective application – Submissionthat vested rights of erstwhile promoters to participate in the recoveryprocess of a corporate debtor have been impaired by retrospectiveapplication of s. 29A – Held: A statute is not retrospective merelybecause it affects existing rights or merely because a part of therequisites for its action is drawn from a time antecedent to its passing– Resolution applicant has no vested right for consideration orapproval of its resolution plan – By application of s. 29A, no vestedright is taken away – Since a resolution applicant who applies u/s.29A(c) has no vested right to apply for being considered as aresolution applicant, submission cannot be accepted. s. 29A and s.35(1)(f) proviso – s. 29A if restricted tomalfeasance – Submission that s. 29A puts a blanket ban onparticipation of all promoters of corporate debtors, without anymechanism to weed out the unscrupulous as against the efficientmanager but who have not been able to pay off their debts due toother reasons – Held: s. 29A not restricted to malfeasance –Legislative purpose which permeates s. 29A continues to permeatethe Section when it applies not merely to resolution applicants, butto liquidation also.s. 29(A)(c) – One year period in s. 29A – Non-performingasset – Plea that u/s. 29A(c), a person’s account may be classifiedas a non- performing asset even though he is not a wilful defaulter;and that the period of one year referred in clause (c) is whollyarbitrary and without any basis either in rationality or in law –Held: A person is a defaulter when an installment and/or intereston the principal remains overdue for more than three months, afterwhich, its account is declared NPA – During the period of one yearthereafter, this grace period is given to such person to pay off thedebt – If a person is unable to repay a loan taken, in whole or inpart, within this period of one year and three months, he would beineligible to become a resolution applicant – This legislative policycannot be found fault with – Neither can the period of one year befound fault with.ss. 29A(j) and 5(24A) – Related party – Plea that personswho may be relatives of erstwhile promoters are debarred frombecoming a resolution applicant – Held: Persons who act jointly orin concert with others are connected with the business activity ofthe resolution applicant – Similarly, all the categories of personsmentioned in s. 5(24A) show that such persons must be “connected”with the resolution applicant within the meaning of s. 29A(j) – Thus,the said categories of persons who are collectively mentioned underthe caption “relative” obviously need to have a connection with thebusiness activity of the resolution applicant – In the absence ofshowing that such person is “connected” with the business of theactivity of the resolution applicant, such person cannot possibly bedisqualified u/s. 29A(j) – Explanation I clause (ii) to s. 29A(j) makesit clear that if a person is otherwise covered as a “connected person”,this provision would also cover a person who is in management orcontrol of the business of the corporate debtor during the implementation of a resolution plan – Thus, any such person is notindeterminate at all, but is a person who is in the saddle of thebusiness of the corporate debtor either at an anterior point of timeor even during implementation of the resolution plan.s. 29A – Exemption of micro, small and medium enterprisesfrom s. 29A – Justification of – Held: Justified – Rationale forexcluding such industries from the eligibility criteria laid down inss. 29A(c) and 29A(h) is because qua such industries, otherresolution applicants may not be forthcoming, which then willinevitably lead not to resolution, but to liquidation – Micro, Smalland Medium Enterprises Development Act, 2006 – s. 7.s. 53 – Distribution of assets – Submission that in the event ofliquidation, operational creditors would never get anything as theyrank below all other creditors, including other unsecured creditorswho happen to be financial creditors, thus s. 53(1)(f) discriminatoryand arbitrary thus, violative of Art. 14 – Held: s. 53 does not violateArt. 14 – Repayment of financial debts infuses capital into theeconomy inasmuch as banks and financial institutions are able,with the money that has been paid back, to further lend such moneyto other entrepreneurs for their businesses – This rationale createsan intelligible differentia between financial debts and operationaldebts, which are unsecured, which is directly related to the objectsought to be achieved by the Code – So long as there is somelegitimate interest sought to be protected, having relation to theobject sought to be achieved by the statute, Art. 14 does not getinfracted – Constitution of India – Art. 14.Object and reasons for the Code – Explained.Enactment and working of the Code – Explained.Companies Act, 2013: s. 412 – Selection of members oftribunal and appellate tribunal – Plea that appointment of membersof the NCLT and the NCLAT contrary to Madras Bar Association(III)’s case – s. 412 whereby members of the tribunal and appellatetribunal to be selected, two judicial members of the SelectionCommittee get outweighed by three bureaucrats – Held: s. 412 hasbeen amended by the Companies Amendment Act, 2017 – Presentmembers of NCLT and NCLAT have been appointed by the SelectionCommittee, reconstituted in compliance with the direction of thisCourt. Judiciary: NCLAT Bench – Creation of Circuit Benches –Submission that NCLAT Bench has a seat only at New Delhi and iscontrary to the judgment in Madras Bar Association (II) case –Held: In view of the assurance by the Attorney General that CircuitBenches would be established soon, issuance of direction to Unionof India to set up Circuit Benches of the NCLAT within the stipulatedperiod.Constitution of India: Art. 77 – Submission that the tribunals-NCLT and NCLAT are functioning under the wrong Ministry-Ministryof Corporate Affairs, however, as per the Madras Bar Association(I)case the administrative support for all the tribunals should be fromthe Ministry of Law and Justice – Held: Rules of business beingmandatory in nature and having to be followed, are to be followedby the executive branch of the Government – However, this Court isbeing bound by the Madras Bar Association(I), the Union of Indiato follow the judgment, both in letter and spirit.",

        "HeadNote": "Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016:Constitutional validity of – Held: Provisions of the Code passesconstitutional muster.ss. 5(7), 5(8), 5(20), 7(1), 7(4), 7(5), 8 and 9 – Classificationbetween financial creditor and operational creditor – Whetherdiscriminatory, arbitrary, and violative of Art. 14 – Held: Preservingthe corporate debtor as a going concern, while ensuring maximumrecovery for all creditors being the objective of the Code, financialcreditors are clearly different from operational creditors – Thus,there is an intelligible differentia between the two which has a directrelation to the objects sought to be achieved by the Code – Thus,there is no discrimination – Constitution of India – Art. 14.ss. 3, 3(9)(c), 214(e), 60, 65, 75, 7, 8 and 9 – Notice, hearing,and set-off or counterclaim qua financial debts – Triggering ofinsolvency resolution process by financial creditors and operationalcreditors – Submission that the difference in the triggering processat behest of financial creditors and operational creditors isdiscriminatory and arbitrary – Held: A financial creditor has toprove “default” as opposed to an operational creditor who merely“claims” a right to payment of a liability or obligation in respect ofa debt which may be due – In view thereof, the differentiation in thetriggering of insolvency resolution process by financial creditorsu/s. 7 and by operational creditors u/ss. 8 and 9 becomes clear –Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India (Information Utilities)Regulations, 2017 – Insolvency and Bankruptcy (Application toAdjudicating Authority) Rules, 2016 – Form I. ss. 21, 24, 28 and 30(2)(b) r/w s. 31 – Operational creditors– Right to vote in the committee of creditors – Plea that operationalcreditor do not have even a single vote in committee of creditors –Held: Financial creditors are best equipped to assess viability andfeasibility of the business of the corporate debtor and evaluate thecontents of a resolution plan – On the other hand, operationalcreditors, who provide goods and services, are involved only inrecovering amounts that are paid for such goods and services, andare typically unable to assess viability and feasibility of business –Resolution plan cannot pass muster u/s. 30(2)(b) rw s. 31 unless aminimum payment is made to operational creditors, being not lessthan liquidation value – Regulation 38 strengthens the rights ofoperational creditors by statutorily incorporating the principle offair and equitable dealing of operational creditors’ rights, togetherwith priority in payment over financial creditors – Thus, theoperational creditors are not discriminated against nor Art. 14 hasbeen infracted either on the ground of equals being treated unequallyor on the ground of manifest arbitrariness – Insolvency andBankruptcy Board of India (Insolvency Resolution Process forCorporate Persons) Regulations, 2016 – Regulation 38 –Constitution of India – Art. 14.ss.12A(as amended) and 60 – s. 12A wherein withdrawal ofapplication admitted u/ss 7, 9 or 10, with approval of ninety percent voting shares of the committee of creditors – s. 12A if violativeof Art. 14 – Held: s. 12A is not violative of Art. 14 – ILC Report hasexplained that as all financial creditors have to put their headstogether to allow such withdrawal as, ordinarily, an omnibussettlement involving all creditors ought, ideally, to be entered into –In any case, the figure of ninety per cent, in the absence of anythingfurther to show that it is arbitrary, must pertain to the domain oflegislative policy – Also, if the committee of creditors arbitrarilyrejects a just settlement and/or withdrawal claim, the NCLT, andthereafter, the NCLAT can always set aside such decision u/s. 60 –Insolvency and Bankruptcy (Second Amendment) Act, 2018 –Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India (Insolvency ResolutionProcess for Corporate Persons) Regulations, 2016 – Reg 30A.s. 210 – Private Information Utilities – Evidence providedby private information utilities – Plea that Private Information Utilities not governed by proper norms and evidence of loan defaultin records of such utility not conclusive evidence – Held: Regulations20 and 21 makes it clear that apart from the stringent requirementsas to registration of such utility, the moment information of defaultis received, such information has to be communicated to all partiesand sureties to the debt and an information utility shall expeditiouslyundertake the process of authentication and verification ofinformation – Evidence provided by private information utilities isonly prima facie evidence of default which is rebuttable by thecorporate debtor – Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India(Insolvency Resolution Process for Corporate Persons) Regulations,2016 – Regulations 20 and 21ss. 18, 41, 42 and 28 – Resolution professional – Adjudicatorypower, under the Code and the Regulations – Held: It is clear fromthe Code as well as the Regulations that the resolution professionalhas no adjudicatory powers – Resolution professional is givenadministrative as opposed to quasi-judicial powers – Even whenthe resolution professional is to make a “determination” underRegulation 35A, he is only to apply to the Adjudicating Authorityfor appropriate relief based on the determination made – Thus, theresolution professional is really a facilitator of the resolution process,whose administrative functions are overseen by the committee ofcreditors and by the Adjudicating Authority – Insolvency andBankruptcy Board of India (Insolvency Resolution Process forCorporate Persons) Regulations, 2016 – Regulations 10, 12, 13,14, and 35A.s. 29A(as amended) – Retrospective application – Submissionthat vested rights of erstwhile promoters to participate in the recoveryprocess of a corporate debtor have been impaired by retrospectiveapplication of s. 29A – Held: A statute is not retrospective merelybecause it affects existing rights or merely because a part of therequisites for its action is drawn from a time antecedent to its passing– Resolution applicant has no vested right for consideration orapproval of its resolution plan – By application of s. 29A, no vestedright is taken away – Since a resolution applicant who applies u/s.29A(c) has no vested right to apply for being considered as aresolution applicant, submission cannot be accepted. s. 29A and s.35(1)(f) proviso – s. 29A if restricted tomalfeasance – Submission that s. 29A puts a blanket ban onparticipation of all promoters of corporate debtors, without anymechanism to weed out the unscrupulous as against the efficientmanager but who have not been able to pay off their debts due toother reasons – Held: s. 29A not restricted to malfeasance –Legislative purpose which permeates s. 29A continues to permeatethe Section when it applies not merely to resolution applicants, butto liquidation also.s. 29(A)(c) – One year period in s. 29A – Non-performingasset – Plea that u/s. 29A(c), a person’s account may be classifiedas a non- performing asset even though he is not a wilful defaulter;and that the period of one year referred in clause (c) is whollyarbitrary and without any basis either in rationality or in law –Held: A person is a defaulter when an installment and/or intereston the principal remains overdue for more than three months, afterwhich, its account is declared NPA – During the period of one yearthereafter, this grace period is given to such person to pay off thedebt – If a person is unable to repay a loan taken, in whole or inpart, within this period of one year and three months, he would beineligible to become a resolution applicant – This legislative policycannot be found fault with – Neither can the period of one year befound fault with.ss. 29A(j) and 5(24A) – Related party – Plea that personswho may be relatives of erstwhile promoters are debarred frombecoming a resolution applicant – Held: Persons who act jointly orin concert with others are connected with the business activity ofthe resolution applicant – Similarly, all the categories of personsmentioned in s. 5(24A) show that such persons must be “connected”with the resolution applicant within the meaning of s. 29A(j) – Thus,the said categories of persons who are collectively mentioned underthe caption “relative” obviously need to have a connection with thebusiness activity of the resolution applicant – In the absence ofshowing that such person is “connected” with the business of theactivity of the resolution applicant, such person cannot possibly bedisqualified u/s. 29A(j) – Explanation I clause (ii) to s. 29A(j) makesit clear that if a person is otherwise covered as a “connected person”,this provision would also cover a person who is in management orcontrol of the business of the corporate debtor during the implementation of a resolution plan – Thus, any such person is notindeterminate at all, but is a person who is in the saddle of thebusiness of the corporate debtor either at an anterior point of timeor even during implementation of the resolution plan.s. 29A – Exemption of micro, small and medium enterprisesfrom s. 29A – Justification of – Held: Justified – Rationale forexcluding such industries from the eligibility criteria laid down inss. 29A(c) and 29A(h) is because qua such industries, otherresolution applicants may not be forthcoming, which then willinevitably lead not to resolution, but to liquidation – Micro, Smalland Medium Enterprises Development Act, 2006 – s. 7.s. 53 – Distribution of assets – Submission that in the event ofliquidation, operational creditors would never get anything as theyrank below all other creditors, including other unsecured creditorswho happen to be financial creditors, thus s. 53(1)(f) discriminatoryand arbitrary thus, violative of Art. 14 – Held: s. 53 does not violateArt. 14 – Repayment of financial debts infuses capital into theeconomy inasmuch as banks and financial institutions are able,with the money that has been paid back, to further lend such moneyto other entrepreneurs for their businesses – This rationale createsan intelligible differentia between financial debts and operationaldebts, which are unsecured, which is directly related to the objectsought to be achieved by the Code – So long as there is somelegitimate interest sought to be protected, having relation to theobject sought to be achieved by the statute, Art. 14 does not getinfracted – Constitution of India – Art. 14.Object and reasons for the Code – Explained.Enactment and working of the Code – Explained.Companies Act, 2013: s. 412 – Selection of members oftribunal and appellate tribunal – Plea that appointment of membersof the NCLT and the NCLAT contrary to Madras Bar Association(III)’s case – s. 412 whereby members of the tribunal and appellatetribunal to be selected, two judicial members of the SelectionCommittee get outweighed by three bureaucrats – Held: s. 412 hasbeen amended by the Companies Amendment Act, 2017 – Presentmembers of NCLT and NCLAT have been appointed by the SelectionCommittee, reconstituted in compliance with the direction of thisCourt. Judiciary: NCLAT Bench – Creation of Circuit Benches –Submission that NCLAT Bench has a seat only at New Delhi and iscontrary to the judgment in Madras Bar Association (II) case –Held: In view of the assurance by the Attorney General that CircuitBenches would be established soon, issuance of direction to Unionof India to set up Circuit Benches of the NCLAT within the stipulatedperiod.Constitution of India: Art. 77 – Submission that the tribunals-NCLT and NCLAT are functioning under the wrong Ministry-Ministryof Corporate Affairs, however, as per the Madras Bar Association(I)case the administrative support for all the tribunals should be fromthe Ministry of Law and Justice – Held: Rules of business beingmandatory in nature and having to be followed, are to be followedby the executive branch of the Government – However, this Court isbeing bound by the Madras Bar Association(I), the Union of Indiato follow the judgment, both in letter and spirit.",

Classificationbetween financial creditor and operational creditor – Whetherdiscriminatory, arbitrary, and violative of Art. 14 – Held: Preservingthe corporate debtor as a going concern, while ensuring maximumrecovery for all creditors being the objective of the Code, financialcreditors are clearly different from operational creditors – Thus,there is an intelligible differentia between the two which has a directrelation to the objects sought to be achieved by the Code – Thus,there is no discrimination – Constitution of India – Art. 14.ss. 3, 3(9)(c), 214(e), 60, 65, 75, 7, 8 and 9 – Notice, hearing,and set-off or counterclaim qua financial debts – Triggering ofinsolvency resolution process by financial creditors and operationalcreditors – Submission that the difference in the triggering processat behest of financial creditors and operational creditors isdiscriminatory and arbitrary – Held: A financial creditor has toprove “default” as opposed to an operational creditor who merely“claims” a right to payment of a liability or obligation in respect ofa debt which may be due – In view thereof, the differentiation in thetriggering of insolvency resolution process by financial creditorsu/s. 7 and by operational creditors u/ss. 8 and 9 becomes clear –Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India (Information Utilities)Regulations, 2017 – Insolvency and Bankruptcy (Application toAdjudicating Authority) Rules, 2016 – Form I. ss. 21, 24, 28 and 30(2)(b) r/w s. 31 – Operational creditors– Right to vote in the committee of creditors – Plea that operationalcreditor do not have even a single vote in committee of creditors –Held: Financial creditors are best equipped to assess viability andfeasibility of the business of the corporate debtor and evaluate thecontents of a resolution plan – On the other hand, operationalcreditors, who provide goods and services, are involved only inrecovering amounts that are paid for such goods and services, andare typically unable to assess viability and feasibility of business –Resolution plan cannot pass muster u/s. 30(2)(b) rw s. 31 unless aminimum payment is made to operational creditors, being not lessthan liquidation value – Regulation 38 strengthens the rights ofoperational creditors by statutorily incorporating the principle offair and equitable dealing of operational creditors’ rights, togetherwith priority in payment over financial creditors – Thus, theoperational creditors are not discriminated against nor Art. 14 hasbeen infracted either on the ground of equals being treated unequallyor on the ground of manifest arbitrariness – Insolvency andBankruptcy Board of India (Insolvency Resolution Process forCorporate Persons) Regulations, 2016 – Regulation 38 –Constitution of India – Art. 14.ss.12A(as amended) and 60 – s. 12A wherein withdrawal ofapplication admitted u/ss 7, 9 or 10, with approval of ninety percent voting shares of the committee of creditors – s. 12A if violativeof Art. 14 – Held: s. 12A is not violative of Art. 14 – ILC Report hasexplained that as all financial creditors have to put their headstogether to allow such withdrawal as, ordinarily, an omnibussettlement involving all creditors ought, ideally, to be entered into –In any case, the figure of ninety per cent, in the absence of anythingfurther to show that it is arbitrary, must pertain to the domain oflegislative policy – Also, if the committee of creditors arbitrarilyrejects a just settlement and/or withdrawal claim, the NCLT, andthereafter, the NCLAT can always set aside such decision u/s. 60 –Insolvency and Bankruptcy (Second Amendment) Act, 2018 –Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India (Insolvency ResolutionProcess for Corporate Persons) Regulations, 2016 – Reg 30A.s. 210 – Private Information Utilities – Evidence providedby private information utilities – Plea that Private Information Utilities not governed by proper norms and evidence of loan defaultin records of such utility not conclusive evidence – Held: Regulations20 and 21 makes it clear that apart from the stringent requirementsas to registration of such utility, the moment information of defaultis received, such information has to be communicated to all partiesand sureties to the debt and an information utility shall expeditiouslyundertake the process of authentication and verification ofinformation – Evidence provided by private information utilities isonly prima facie evidence of default which is rebuttable by thecorporate debtor – Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India(Insolvency Resolution Process for Corporate Persons) Regulations,2016 – Regulations 20 and 21ss. 18, 41, 42 and 28 – Resolution professional – Adjudicatorypower, under the Code and the Regulations – Held: It is clear fromthe Code as well as the Regulations that the resolution professionalhas no adjudicatory powers – Resolution professional is givenadministrative as opposed to quasi-judicial powers – Even whenthe resolution professional is to make a “determination” underRegulation 35A, he is only to apply to the Adjudicating Authorityfor appropriate relief based on the determination made – Thus, theresolution professional is really a facilitator of the resolution process,whose administrative functions are overseen by the committee ofcreditors and by the Adjudicating Authority – Insolvency andBankruptcy Board of India (Insolvency Resolution Process forCorporate Persons) Regulations, 2016 – Regulations 10, 12, 13,14, and 35A.s. 29A(as amended) – Retrospective application – Submissionthat vested rights of erstwhile promoters to participate in the recoveryprocess of a corporate debtor have been impaired by retrospectiveapplication of s. 29A – Held: A statute is not retrospective merelybecause it affects existing rights or merely because a part of therequisites for its action is drawn from a time antecedent to its passing– Resolution applicant has no vested right for consideration orapproval of its resolution plan – By application of s. 29A, no vestedright is taken away – Since a resolution applicant who applies u/s.29A(c) has no vested right to apply for being considered as aresolution applicant, submission cannot be accepted. s. 29A and s.35(1)(f) proviso – s. 29A if restricted tomalfeasance – Submission that s. 29A puts a blanket ban onparticipation of all promoters of corporate debtors, without anymechanism to weed out the unscrupulous as against the efficientmanager but who have not been able to pay off their debts due toother reasons – Held: s. 29A not restricted to malfeasance –Legislative purpose which permeates s. 29A continues to permeatethe Section when it applies not merely to resolution applicants, butto liquidation also.s. 29(A)(c) – One year period in s. 29A – Non-performingasset – Plea that u/s. 29A(c), a person’s account may be classifiedas a non- performing asset even though he is not a wilful defaulter;and that the period of one year referred in clause (c) is whollyarbitrary and without any basis either in rationality or in law –Held: A person is a defaulter when an installment and/or intereston the principal remains overdue for more than three months, afterwhich, its account is declared NPA – During the period of one yearthereafter, this grace period is given to such person to pay off thedebt – If a person is unable to repay a loan taken, in whole or inpart, within this period of one year and three months, he would beineligible to become a resolution applicant – This legislative policycannot be found fault with – Neither can the period of one year befound fault with.ss. 29A(j) and 5(24A) – Related party – Plea that personswho may be relatives of erstwhile promoters are debarred frombecoming a resolution applicant – Held: Persons who act jointly orin concert with others are connected with the business activity ofthe resolution applicant – Similarly, all the categories of personsmentioned in s. 5(24A) show that such persons must be “connected”with the resolution applicant within the meaning of s. 29A(j) – Thus,the said categories of persons who are collectively mentioned underthe caption “relative” obviously need to have a connection with thebusiness activity of the resolution applicant – In the absence ofshowing that such person is “connected” with the business of theactivity of the resolution applicant, such person cannot possibly bedisqualified u/s. 29A(j) – Explanation I clause (ii) to s. 29A(j) makesit clear that if a person is otherwise covered as a “connected person”,this provision would also cover a person who is in management orcontrol of the business of the corporate debtor during the implementation of a resolution plan – Thus, any such person is notindeterminate at all, but is a person who is in the saddle of thebusiness of the corporate debtor either at an anterior point of timeor even during implementation of the resolution plan.s. 29A – Exemption of micro, small and medium enterprisesfrom s. 29A – Justification of – Held: Justified – Rationale forexcluding such industries from the eligibility criteria laid down inss. 29A(c) and 29A(h) is because qua such industries, otherresolution applicants may not be forthcoming, which then willinevitably lead not to resolution, but to liquidation – Micro, Smalland Medium Enterprises Development Act, 2006 – s. 7.s. 53 – Distribution of assets – Submission that in the event ofliquidation, operational creditors would never get anything as theyrank below all other creditors, including other unsecured creditorswho happen to be financial creditors, thus s. 53(1)(f) discriminatoryand arbitrary thus, violative of Art. 14 – Held: s. 53 does not violateArt. 14 – Repayment of financial debts infuses capital into theeconomy inasmuch as banks and financial institutions are able,with the money that has been paid back, to further lend such moneyto other entrepreneurs for their businesses – This rationale createsan intelligible differentia between financial debts and operationaldebts, which are unsecured, which is directly related to the objectsought to be achieved by the Code – So long as there is somelegitimate interest sought to be protected, having relation to theobject sought to be achieved by the statute, Art. 14 does not getinfracted – Constitution of India – Art. 14.Object and reasons for the Code – Explained.Enactment and working of the Code – Explained.Companies Act, 2013: s. 412 – Selection of members oftribunal and appellate tribunal – Plea that appointment of membersof the NCLT and the NCLAT contrary to Madras Bar Association(III)’s case – s. 412 whereby members of the tribunal and appellatetribunal to be selected, two judicial members of the SelectionCommittee get outweighed by three bureaucrats – Held: s. 412 hasbeen amended by the Companies Amendment Act, 2017 – Presentmembers of NCLT and NCLAT have been appointed by the SelectionCommittee, reconstituted in compliance with the direction of thisCourt. Judiciary: NCLAT Bench – Creation of Circuit Benches –Submission that NCLAT Bench has a seat only at New Delhi and iscontrary to the judgment in Madras Bar Association (II) case –Held: In view of the assurance by the Attorney General that CircuitBenches would be established soon, issuance of direction to Unionof India to set up Circuit Benches of the NCLAT within the stipulatedperiod.Constitution of India: Art. 77 – Submission that the tribunals-NCLT and NCLAT are functioning under the wrong Ministry-Ministryof Corporate Affairs, however, as per the Madras Bar Association(I)case the administrative support for all the tribunals should be fromthe Ministry of Law and Justice – Held: Rules of business beingmandatory in nature and having to be followed, are to be followedby the executive branch of the Government – However, this Court isbeing bound by the Madras Bar Association(I), the Union of Indiato follow the judgment, both in letter and spirit.",

Classificationbetween financial creditor and operational creditor – Whetherdiscriminatory, arbitrary, and violative of Art. 14 – Held: Preservingthe corporate debtor as a going concern, while ensuring maximumrecovery for all creditors being the objective of the Code, financialcreditors are clearly different from operational creditors – Thus,there is an intelligible differentia between the two which has a directrelation to the objects sought to be achieved by the Code – Thus,there is no discrimination – Constitution of India – Art. 14.ss. 3, 3(9)(c), 214(e), 60, 65, 75, 7, 8 and 9 – Notice, hearing,and set-off or counterclaim qua financial debts – Triggering ofinsolvency resolution process by financial creditors and operationalcreditors – Submission that the difference in the triggering processat behest of financial creditors and operational creditors isdiscriminatory and arbitrary – Held: A financial creditor has toprove “default” as opposed to an operational creditor who merely“claims” a right to payment of a liability or obligation in respect ofa debt which may be due – In view thereof, the differentiation in thetriggering of insolvency resolution process by financial creditorsu/s. 7 and by operational creditors u/ss. 8 and 9 becomes clear –Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India (Information Utilities)Regulations, 2017 – Insolvency and Bankruptcy (Application toAdjudicating Authority) Rules, 2016 – Form I. ss. 21, 24, 28 and 30(2)(b) r/w s. 31 – Operational creditors– Right to vote in the committee of creditors – Plea that operationalcreditor do not have even a single vote in committee of creditors –Held: Financial creditors are best equipped to assess viability andfeasibility of the business of the corporate debtor and evaluate thecontents of a resolution plan – On the other hand, operationalcreditors, who provide goods and services, are involved only inrecovering amounts that are paid for such goods and services, andare typically unable to assess viability and feasibility of business –Resolution plan cannot pass muster u/s. 30(2)(b) rw s. 31 unless aminimum payment is made to operational creditors, being not lessthan liquidation value – Regulation 38 strengthens the rights ofoperational creditors by statutorily incorporating the principle offair and equitable dealing of operational creditors’ rights, togetherwith priority in payment over financial creditors – Thus, theoperational creditors are not discriminated against nor Art. 14 hasbeen infracted either on the ground of equals being treated unequallyor on the ground of manifest arbitrariness – Insolvency andBankruptcy Board of India (Insolvency Resolution Process forCorporate Persons) Regulations, 2016 – Regulation 38 –Constitution of India – Art. 14.ss.12A(as amended) and 60 – s. 12A wherein withdrawal ofapplication admitted u/ss 7, 9 or 10, with approval of ninety percent voting shares of the committee of creditors – s. 12A if violativeof Art. 14 – Held: s. 12A is not violative of Art. 14 – ILC Report hasexplained that as all financial creditors have to put their headstogether to allow such withdrawal as, ordinarily, an omnibussettlement involving all creditors ought, ideally, to be entered into –In any case, the figure of ninety per cent, in the absence of anythingfurther to show that it is arbitrary, must pertain to the domain oflegislative policy – Also, if the committee of creditors arbitrarilyrejects a just settlement and/or withdrawal claim, the NCLT, andthereafter, the NCLAT can always set aside such decision u/s. 60 –Insolvency and Bankruptcy (Second Amendment) Act, 2018 –Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India (Insolvency ResolutionProcess for Corporate Persons) Regulations, 2016 – Reg 30A.s. 210 – Private Information Utilities – Evidence providedby private information utilities – Plea that Private Information Utilities not governed by proper norms and evidence of loan defaultin records of such utility not conclusive evidence – Held: Regulations20 and 21 makes it clear that apart from the stringent requirementsas to registration of such utility, the moment information of defaultis received, such information has to be communicated to all partiesand sureties to the debt and an information utility shall expeditiouslyundertake the process of authentication and verification ofinformation – Evidence provided by private information utilities isonly prima facie evidence of default which is rebuttable by thecorporate debtor – Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India(Insolvency Resolution Process for Corporate Persons) Regulations,2016 – Regulations 20 and 21ss. 18, 41, 42 and 28 – Resolution professional – Adjudicatorypower, under the Code and the Regulations – Held: It is clear fromthe Code as well as the Regulations that the resolution professionalhas no adjudicatory powers – Resolution professional is givenadministrative as opposed to quasi-judicial powers – Even whenthe resolution professional is to make a “determination” underRegulation 35A, he is only to apply to the Adjudicating Authorityfor appropriate relief based on the determination made – Thus, theresolution professional is really a facilitator of the resolution process,whose administrative functions are overseen by the committee ofcreditors and by the Adjudicating Authority – Insolvency andBankruptcy Board of India (Insolvency Resolution Process forCorporate Persons) Regulations, 2016 – Regulations 10, 12, 13,14, and 35A.s. 29A(as amended) – Retrospective application – Submissionthat vested rights of erstwhile promoters to participate in the recoveryprocess of a corporate debtor have been impaired by retrospectiveapplication of s. 29A – Held: A statute is not retrospective merelybecause it affects existing rights or merely because a part of therequisites for its action is drawn from a time antecedent to its passing– Resolution applicant has no vested right for consideration orapproval of its resolution plan – By application of s. 29A, no vestedright is taken away – Since a resolution applicant who applies u/s.29A(c) has no vested right to apply for being considered as aresolution applicant, submission cannot be accepted. s. 29A and s.35(1)(f) proviso – s. 29A if restricted tomalfeasance – Submission that s. 29A puts a blanket ban onparticipation of all promoters of corporate debtors, without anymechanism to weed out the unscrupulous as against the efficientmanager but who have not been able to pay off their debts due toother reasons – Held: s. 29A not restricted to malfeasance –Legislative purpose which permeates s. 29A continues to permeatethe Section when it applies not merely to resolution applicants, butto liquidation also.s. 29(A)(c) – One year period in s. 29A – Non-performingasset – Plea that u/s. 29A(c), a person’s account may be classifiedas a non- performing asset even though he is not a wilful defaulter;and that the period of one year referred in clause (c) is whollyarbitrary and without any basis either in rationality or in law –Held: A person is a defaulter when an installment and/or intereston the principal remains overdue for more than three months, afterwhich, its account is declared NPA – During the period of one yearthereafter, this grace period is given to such person to pay off thedebt – If a person is unable to repay a loan taken, in whole or inpart, within this period of one year and three months, he would beineligible to become a resolution applicant – This legislative policycannot be found fault with – Neither can the period of one year befound fault with.ss. 29A(j) and 5(24A) – Related party – Plea that personswho may be relatives of erstwhile promoters are debarred frombecoming a resolution applicant – Held: Persons who act jointly orin concert with others are connected with the business activity ofthe resolution applicant – Similarly, all the categories of personsmentioned in s. 5(24A) show that such persons must be “connected”with the resolution applicant within the meaning of s. 29A(j) – Thus,the said categories of persons who are collectively mentioned underthe caption “relative” obviously need to have a connection with thebusiness activity of the resolution applicant – In the absence ofshowing that such person is “connected” with the business of theactivity of the resolution applicant, such person cannot possibly bedisqualified u/s. 29A(j) – Explanation I clause (ii) to s. 29A(j) makesit clear that if a person is otherwise covered as a “connected person”,this provision would also cover a person who is in management orcontrol of the business of the corporate debtor during the implementation of a resolution plan – Thus, any such person is notindeterminate at all, but is a person who is in the saddle of thebusiness of the corporate debtor either at an anterior point of timeor even during implementation of the resolution plan.s. 29A – Exemption of micro, small and medium enterprisesfrom s. 29A – Justification of – Held: Justified – Rationale forexcluding such industries from the eligibility criteria laid down inss. 29A(c) and 29A(h) is because qua such industries, otherresolution applicants may not be forthcoming, which then willinevitably lead not to resolution, but to liquidation – Micro, Smalland Medium Enterprises Development Act, 2006 – s. 7.s. 53 – Distribution of assets – Submission that in the event ofliquidation, operational creditors would never get anything as theyrank below all other creditors, including other unsecured creditorswho happen to be financial creditors, thus s. 53(1)(f) discriminatoryand arbitrary thus, violative of Art. 14 – Held: s. 53 does not violateArt. 14 – Repayment of financial debts infuses capital into theeconomy inasmuch as banks and financial institutions are able,with the money that has been paid back, to further lend such moneyto other entrepreneurs for their businesses – This rationale createsan intelligible differentia between financial debts and operationaldebts, which are unsecured, which is directly related to the objectsought to be achieved by the Code – So long as there is somelegitimate interest sought to be protected, having relation to theobject sought to be achieved by the statute, Art. 14 does not getinfracted – Constitution of India – Art. 14.Object and reasons for the Code – Explained.Enactment and working of the Code – Explained.Companies Act, 2013: s. 412 – Selection of members oftribunal and appellate tribunal – Plea that appointment of membersof the NCLT and the NCLAT contrary to Madras Bar Association(III)’s case – s. 412 whereby members of the tribunal and appellatetribunal to be selected, two judicial members of the SelectionCommittee get outweighed by three bureaucrats – Held: s. 412 hasbeen amended by the Companies Amendment Act, 2017 – Presentmembers of NCLT and NCLAT have been appointed by the SelectionCommittee, reconstituted in compliance with the direction of thisCourt. Judiciary: NCLAT Bench – Creation of Circuit Benches –Submission that NCLAT Bench has a seat only at New Delhi and iscontrary to the judgment in Madras Bar Association (II) case –Held: In view of the assurance by the Attorney General that CircuitBenches would be established soon, issuance of direction to Unionof India to set up Circuit Benches of the NCLAT within the stipulatedperiod.Constitution of India: Art. 77 – Submission that the tribunals-NCLT and NCLAT are functioning under the wrong Ministry-Ministryof Corporate Affairs, however, as per the Madras Bar Association(I)case the administrative support for all the tribunals should be fromthe Ministry of Law and Justice – Held: Rules of business beingmandatory in nature and having to be followed, are to be followedby the executive branch of the Government – However, this Court isbeing bound by the Madras Bar Association(I), the Union of Indiato follow the judgment, both in letter and spirit.",

Classificationbetween financial creditor and operational creditor – Whetherdiscriminatory, arbitrary, and violative of Art. 14 – Held: Preservingthe corporate debtor as a going concern, while ensuring maximumrecovery for all creditors being the objective of the Code, financialcreditors are clearly different from operational creditors – Thus,there is an intelligible differentia between the two which has a directrelation to the objects sought to be achieved by the Code – Thus,there is no discrimination – Constitution of India – Art. 14.ss. 3, 3(9)(c), 214(e), 60, 65, 75, 7, 8 and 9 – Notice, hearing,and set-off or counterclaim qua financial debts – Triggering ofinsolvency resolution process by financial creditors and operationalcreditors – Submission that the difference in the triggering processat behest of financial creditors and operational creditors isdiscriminatory and arbitrary – Held: A financial creditor has toprove “default” as opposed to an operational creditor who merely“claims” a right to payment of a liability or obligation in respect ofa debt which may be due – In view thereof, the differentiation in thetriggering of insolvency resolution process by financial creditorsu/s. 7 and by operational creditors u/ss. 8 and 9 becomes clear –Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India (Information Utilities)Regulations, 2017 – Insolvency and Bankruptcy (Application toAdjudicating Authority) Rules, 2016 – Form I. ss. 21, 24, 28 and 30(2)(b) r/w s. 31 – Operational creditors– Right to vote in the committee of creditors – Plea that operationalcreditor do not have even a single vote in committee of creditors –Held: Financial creditors are best equipped to assess viability andfeasibility of the business of the corporate debtor and evaluate thecontents of a resolution plan – On the other hand, operationalcreditors, who provide goods and services, are involved only inrecovering amounts that are paid for such goods and services, andare typically unable to assess viability and feasibility of business –Resolution plan cannot pass muster u/s. 30(2)(b) rw s. 31 unless aminimum payment is made to operational creditors, being not lessthan liquidation value – Regulation 38 strengthens the rights ofoperational creditors by statutorily incorporating the principle offair and equitable dealing of operational creditors’ rights, togetherwith priority in payment over financial creditors – Thus, theoperational creditors are not discriminated against nor Art. 14 hasbeen infracted either on the ground of equals being treated unequallyor on the ground of manifest arbitrariness – Insolvency andBankruptcy Board of India (Insolvency Resolution Process forCorporate Persons) Regulations, 2016 – Regulation 38 –Constitution of India – Art. 14.ss.12A(as amended) and 60 – s. 12A wherein withdrawal ofapplication admitted u/ss 7, 9 or 10, with approval of ninety percent voting shares of the committee of creditors – s. 12A if violativeof Art. 14 – Held: s. 12A is not violative of Art. 14 – ILC Report hasexplained that as all financial creditors have to put their headstogether to allow such withdrawal as, ordinarily, an omnibussettlement involving all creditors ought, ideally, to be entered into –In any case, the figure of ninety per cent, in the absence of anythingfurther to show that it is arbitrary, must pertain to the domain oflegislative policy – Also, if the committee of creditors arbitrarilyrejects a just settlement and/or withdrawal claim, the NCLT, andthereafter, the NCLAT can always set aside such decision u/s. 60 –Insolvency and Bankruptcy (Second Amendment) Act, 2018 –Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India (Insolvency ResolutionProcess for Corporate Persons) Regulations, 2016 – Reg 30A.s. 210 – Private Information Utilities – Evidence providedby private information utilities – Plea that Private Information Utilities not governed by proper norms and evidence of loan defaultin records of such utility not conclusive evidence – Held: Regulations20 and 21 makes it clear that apart from the stringent requirementsas to registration of such utility, the moment information of defaultis received, such information has to be communicated to all partiesand sureties to the debt and an information utility shall expeditiouslyundertake the process of authentication and verification ofinformation – Evidence provided by private information utilities isonly prima facie evidence of default which is rebuttable by thecorporate debtor – Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India(Insolvency Resolution Process for Corporate Persons) Regulations,2016 – Regulations 20 and 21ss. 18, 41, 42 and 28 – Resolution professional – Adjudicatorypower, under the Code and the Regulations – Held: It is clear fromthe Code as well as the Regulations that the resolution professionalhas no adjudicatory powers – Resolution professional is givenadministrative as opposed to quasi-judicial powers – Even whenthe resolution professional is to make a “determination” underRegulation 35A, he is only to apply to the Adjudicating Authorityfor appropriate relief based on the determination made – Thus, theresolution professional is really a facilitator of the resolution process,whose administrative functions are overseen by the committee ofcreditors and by the Adjudicating Authority – Insolvency andBankruptcy Board of India (Insolvency Resolution Process forCorporate Persons) Regulations, 2016 – Regulations 10, 12, 13,14, and 35A.s. 29A(as amended) – Retrospective application – Submissionthat vested rights of erstwhile promoters to participate in the recoveryprocess of a corporate debtor have been impaired by retrospectiveapplication of s. 29A – Held: A statute is not retrospective merelybecause it affects existing rights or merely because a part of therequisites for its action is drawn from a time antecedent to its passing– Resolution applicant has no vested right for consideration orapproval of its resolution plan – By application of s. 29A, no vestedright is taken away – Since a resolution applicant who applies u/s.29A(c) has no vested right to apply for being considered as aresolution applicant, submission cannot be accepted. s. 29A and s.35(1)(f) proviso – s. 29A if restricted tomalfeasance – Submission that s. 29A puts a blanket ban onparticipation of all promoters of corporate debtors, without anymechanism to weed out the unscrupulous as against the efficientmanager but who have not been able to pay off their debts due toother reasons – Held: s. 29A not restricted to malfeasance –Legislative purpose which permeates s. 29A continues to permeatethe Section when it applies not merely to resolution applicants, butto liquidation also.s. 29(A)(c) – One year period in s. 29A – Non-performingasset – Plea that u/s. 29A(c), a person’s account may be classifiedas a non- performing asset even though he is not a wilful defaulter;and that the period of one year referred in clause (c) is whollyarbitrary and without any basis either in rationality or in law –Held: A person is a defaulter when an installment and/or intereston the principal remains overdue for more than three months, afterwhich, its account is declared NPA – During the period of one yearthereafter, this grace period is given to such person to pay off thedebt – If a person is unable to repay a loan taken, in whole or inpart, within this period of one year and three months, he would beineligible to become a resolution applicant – This legislative policycannot be found fault with – Neither can the period of one year befound fault with.ss. 29A(j) and 5(24A) – Related party – Plea that personswho may be relatives of erstwhile promoters are debarred frombecoming a resolution applicant – Held: Persons who act jointly orin concert with others are connected with the business activity ofthe resolution applicant – Similarly, all the categories of personsmentioned in s. 5(24A) show that such persons must be “connected”with the resolution applicant within the meaning of s. 29A(j) – Thus,the said categories of persons who are collectively mentioned underthe caption “relative” obviously need to have a connection with thebusiness activity of the resolution applicant – In the absence ofshowing that such person is “connected” with the business of theactivity of the resolution applicant, such person cannot possibly bedisqualified u/s. 29A(j) – Explanation I clause (ii) to s. 29A(j) makesit clear that if a person is otherwise covered as a “connected person”,this provision would also cover a person who is in management orcontrol of the business of the corporate debtor during the implementation of a resolution plan – Thus, any such person is notindeterminate at all, but is a person who is in the saddle of thebusiness of the corporate debtor either at an anterior point of timeor even during implementation of the resolution plan.s. 29A – Exemption of micro, small and medium enterprisesfrom s. 29A – Justification of – Held: Justified – Rationale forexcluding such industries from the eligibility criteria laid down inss. 29A(c) and 29A(h) is because qua such industries, otherresolution applicants may not be forthcoming, which then willinevitably lead not to resolution, but to liquidation – Micro, Smalland Medium Enterprises Development Act, 2006 – s. 7.s. 53 – Distribution of assets – Submission that in the event ofliquidation, operational creditors would never get anything as theyrank below all other creditors, including other unsecured creditorswho happen to be financial creditors, thus s. 53(1)(f) discriminatoryand arbitrary thus, violative of Art. 14 – Held: s. 53 does not violateArt. 14 – Repayment of financial debts infuses capital into theeconomy inasmuch as banks and financial institutions are able,with the money that has been paid back, to further lend such moneyto other entrepreneurs for their businesses – This rationale createsan intelligible differentia between financial debts and operationaldebts, which are unsecured, which is directly related to the objectsought to be achieved by the Code – So long as there is somelegitimate interest sought to be protected, having relation to theobject sought to be achieved by the statute, Art. 14 does not getinfracted – Constitution of India – Art. 14.Object and reasons for the Code – Explained.Enactment and working of the Code – Explained.Companies Act, 2013: s. 412 – Selection of members oftribunal and appellate tribunal – Plea that appointment of membersof the NCLT and the NCLAT contrary to Madras Bar Association(III)’s case – s. 412 whereby members of the tribunal and appellatetribunal to be selected, two judicial members of the SelectionCommittee get outweighed by three bureaucrats – Held: s. 412 hasbeen amended by the Companies Amendment Act, 2017 – Presentmembers of NCLT and NCLAT have been appointed by the SelectionCommittee, reconstituted in compliance with the direction of thisCourt. Judiciary: NCLAT Bench – Creation of Circuit Benches –Submission that NCLAT Bench has a seat only at New Delhi and iscontrary to the judgment in Madras Bar Association (II) case –Held: In view of the assurance by the Attorney General that CircuitBenches would be established soon, issuance of direction to Unionof India to set up Circuit Benches of the NCLAT within the stipulatedperiod.Constitution of India: Art. 77 – Submission that the tribunals-NCLT and NCLAT are functioning under the wrong Ministry-Ministryof Corporate Affairs, however, as per the Madras Bar Association(I)case the administrative support for all the tribunals should be fromthe Ministry of Law and Justice – Held: Rules of business beingmandatory in nature and having to be followed, are to be followedby the executive branch of the Government – However, this Court isbeing bound by the Madras Bar Association(I), the Union of Indiato follow the judgment, both in letter and spirit.",

has a directrelation to the objects sought to be achieved by the Code – Thus,there is no discrimination – Constitution of India – Art. 14.ss. 3, 3(9)(c), 214(e), 60, 65, 75, 7, 8 and 9 – Notice, hearing,and set-off or counterclaim qua financial debts – Triggering ofinsolvency resolution process by financial creditors and operationalcreditors – Submission that the difference in the triggering processat behest of financial creditors and operational creditors isdiscriminatory and arbitrary – Held: A financial creditor has toprove “default” as opposed to an operational creditor who merely“claims” a right to payment of a liability or obligation in respect ofa debt which may be due – In view thereof, the differentiation in thetriggering of insolvency resolution process by financial creditorsu/s. 7 and by operational creditors u/ss. 8 and 9 becomes clear –Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India (Information Utilities)Regulations, 2017 – Insolvency and Bankruptcy (Application toAdjudicating Authority) Rules, 2016 – Form I. ss. 21, 24, 28 and 30(2)(b) r/w s. 31 – Operational creditors– Right to vote in the committee of creditors – Plea that operationalcreditor do not have even a single vote in committee of creditors –Held: Financial creditors are best equipped to assess viability andfeasibility of the business of the corporate debtor and evaluate thecontents of a resolution plan – On the other hand, operationalcreditors, who provide goods and services, are involved only inrecovering amounts that are paid for such goods and services, andare typically unable to assess viability and feasibility of business –Resolution plan cannot pass muster u/s. 30(2)(b) rw s. 31 unless aminimum payment is made to operational creditors, being not lessthan liquidation value – Regulation 38 strengthens the rights ofoperational creditors by statutorily incorporating the principle offair and equitable dealing of operational creditors’ rights, togetherwith priority in payment over financial creditors – Thus, theoperational creditors are not discriminated against nor Art. 14 hasbeen infracted either on the ground of equals being treated unequallyor on the ground of manifest arbitrariness – Insolvency andBankruptcy Board of India (Insolvency Resolution Process forCorporate Persons) Regulations, 2016 – Regulation 38 –Constitution of India – Art. 14.ss.12A(as amended) and 60 – s. 12A wherein withdrawal ofapplication admitted u/ss 7, 9 or 10, with approval of ninety percent voting shares of the committee of creditors – s. 12A if violativeof Art. 14 – Held: s. 12A is not violative of Art. 14 – ILC Report hasexplained that as all financial creditors have to put their headstogether to allow such withdrawal as, ordinarily, an omnibussettlement involving all creditors ought, ideally, to be entered into –In any case, the figure of ninety per cent, in the absence of anythingfurther to show that it is arbitrary, must pertain to the domain oflegislative policy – Also, if the committee of creditors arbitrarilyrejects a just settlement and/or withdrawal claim, the NCLT, andthereafter, the NCLAT can always set aside such decision u/s. 60 –Insolvency and Bankruptcy (Second Amendment) Act, 2018 –Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India (Insolvency ResolutionProcess for Corporate Persons) Regulations, 2016 – Reg 30A.s. 210 – Private Information Utilities – Evidence providedby private information utilities – Plea that Private Information Utilities not governed by proper norms and evidence of loan defaultin records of such utility not conclusive evidence – Held: Regulations20 and 21 makes it clear that apart from the stringent requirementsas to registration of such utility, the moment information of defaultis received, such information has to be communicated to all partiesand sureties to the debt and an information utility shall expeditiouslyundertake the process of authentication and verification ofinformation – Evidence provided by private information utilities isonly prima facie evidence of default which is rebuttable by thecorporate debtor – Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India(Insolvency Resolution Process for Corporate Persons) Regulations,2016 – Regulations 20 and 21ss. 18, 41, 42 and 28 – Resolution professional – Adjudicatorypower, under the Code and the Regulations – Held: It is clear fromthe Code as well as the Regulations that the resolution professionalhas no adjudicatory powers – Resolution professional is givenadministrative as opposed to quasi-judicial powers – Even whenthe resolution professional is to make a “determination” underRegulation 35A, he is only to apply to the Adjudicating Authorityfor appropriate relief based on the determination made – Thus, theresolution professional is really a facilitator of the resolution process,whose administrative functions are overseen by the committee ofcreditors and by the Adjudicating Authority – Insolvency andBankruptcy Board of India (Insolvency Resolution Process forCorporate Persons) Regulations, 2016 – Regulations 10, 12, 13,14, and 35A.s. 29A(as amended) – Retrospective application – Submissionthat vested rights of erstwhile promoters to participate in the recoveryprocess of a corporate debtor have been impaired by retrospectiveapplication of s. 29A – Held: A statute is not retrospective merelybecause it affects existing rights or merely because a part of therequisites for its action is drawn from a time antecedent to its passing– Resolution applicant has no vested right for consideration orapproval of its resolution plan – By application of s. 29A, no vestedright is taken away – Since a resolution applicant who applies u/s.29A(c) has no vested right to apply for being considered as aresolution applicant, submission cannot be accepted. s. 29A and s.35(1)(f) proviso – s. 29A if restricted tomalfeasance – Submission that s. 29A puts a blanket ban onparticipation of all promoters of corporate debtors, without anymechanism to weed out the unscrupulous as against the efficientmanager but who have not been able to pay off their debts due toother reasons – Held: s. 29A not restricted to malfeasance –Legislative purpose which permeates s. 29A continues to permeatethe Section when it applies not merely to resolution applicants, butto liquidation also.s. 29(A)(c) – One year period in s. 29A – Non-performingasset – Plea that u/s. 29A(c), a person’s account may be classifiedas a non- performing asset even though he is not a wilful defaulter;and that the period of one year referred in clause (c) is whollyarbitrary and without any basis either in rationality or in law –Held: A person is a defaulter when an installment and/or intereston the principal remains overdue for more than three months, afterwhich, its account is declared NPA – During the period of one yearthereafter, this grace period is given to such person to pay off thedebt – If a person is unable to repay a loan taken, in whole or inpart, within this period of one year and three months, he would beineligible to become a resolution applicant – This legislative policycannot be found fault with – Neither can the period of one year befound fault with.ss. 29A(j) and 5(24A) – Related party – Plea that personswho may be relatives of erstwhile promoters are debarred frombecoming a resolution applicant – Held: Persons who act jointly orin concert with others are connected with the business activity ofthe resolution applicant – Similarly, all the categories of personsmentioned in s. 5(24A) show that such persons must be “connected”with the resolution applicant within the meaning of s. 29A(j) – Thus,the said categories of persons who are collectively mentioned underthe caption “relative” obviously need to have a connection with thebusiness activity of the resolution applicant – In the absence ofshowing that such person is “connected” with the business of theactivity of the resolution applicant, such person cannot possibly bedisqualified u/s. 29A(j) – Explanation I clause (ii) to s. 29A(j) makesit clear that if a person is otherwise covered as a “connected person”,this provision would also cover a person who is in management orcontrol of the business of the corporate debtor during the implementation of a resolution plan – Thus, any such person is notindeterminate at all, but is a person who is in the saddle of thebusiness of the corporate debtor either at an anterior point of timeor even during implementation of the resolution plan.s. 29A – Exemption of micro, small and medium enterprisesfrom s. 29A – Justification of – Held: Justified – Rationale forexcluding such industries from the eligibility criteria laid down inss. 29A(c) and 29A(h) is because qua such industries, otherresolution applicants may not be forthcoming, which then willinevitably lead not to resolution, but to liquidation – Micro, Smalland Medium Enterprises Development Act, 2006 – s. 7.s. 53 – Distribution of assets – Submission that in the event ofliquidation, operational creditors would never get anything as theyrank below all other creditors, including other unsecured creditorswho happen to be financial creditors, thus s. 53(1)(f) discriminatoryand arbitrary thus, violative of Art. 14 – Held: s. 53 does not violateArt. 14 – Repayment of financial debts infuses capital into theeconomy inasmuch as banks and financial institutions are able,with the money that has been paid back, to further lend such moneyto other entrepreneurs for their businesses – This rationale createsan intelligible differentia between financial debts and operationaldebts, which are unsecured, which is directly related to the objectsought to be achieved by the Code – So long as there is somelegitimate interest sought to be protected, having relation to theobject sought to be achieved by the statute, Art. 14 does not getinfracted – Constitution of India – Art. 14.Object and reasons for the Code – Explained.Enactment and working of the Code – Explained.Companies Act, 2013: s. 412 – Selection of members oftribunal and appellate tribunal – Plea that appointment of membersof the NCLT and the NCLAT contrary to Madras Bar Association(III)’s case – s. 412 whereby members of the tribunal and appellatetribunal to be selected, two judicial members of the SelectionCommittee get outweighed by three bureaucrats – Held: s. 412 hasbeen amended by the Companies Amendment Act, 2017 – Presentmembers of NCLT and NCLAT have been appointed by the SelectionCommittee, reconstituted in compliance with the direction of thisCourt. Judiciary: NCLAT Bench – Creation of Circuit Benches –Submission that NCLAT Bench has a seat only at New Delhi and iscontrary to the judgment in Madras Bar Association (II) case –Held: In view of the assurance by the Attorney General that CircuitBenches would be established soon, issuance of direction to Unionof India to set up Circuit Benches of the NCLAT within the stipulatedperiod.Constitution of India: Art. 77 – Submission that the tribunals-NCLT and NCLAT are functioning under the wrong Ministry-Ministryof Corporate Affairs, however, as per the Madras Bar Association(I)case the administrative support for all the tribunals should be fromthe Ministry of Law and Justice – Held: Rules of business beingmandatory in nature and having to be followed, are to be followedby the executive branch of the Government – However, this Court isbeing bound by the Madras Bar Association(I), the Union of Indiato follow the judgment, both in letter and spirit.",

        "HeadNote": "Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016:Constitutional validity of – Held: Provisions of the Code passesconstitutional muster.ss. 5(7), 5(8), 5(20), 7(1), 7(4), 7(5), 8 and 9 – Classificationbetween financial creditor and operational creditor – Whetherdiscriminatory, arbitrary, and violative of Art. 14 – Held: Preservingthe corporate debtor as a going concern, while ensuring maximumrecovery for all creditors being the objective of the Code, financialcreditors are clearly different from operational creditors – Thus,there is an intelligible differentia between the two which has a directrelation to the objects sought to be achieved by the Code – Thus,there is no discrimination – Constitution of India – Art. 14.ss. 3, 3(9)(c), 214(e), 60, 65, 75, 7, 8 and 9 – Notice, hearing,and set-off or counterclaim qua financial debts – Triggering ofinsolvency resolution process by financial creditors and operationalcreditors – Submission that the difference in the triggering processat behest of financial creditors and operational creditors isdiscriminatory and arbitrary – Held: A financial creditor has toprove “default” as opposed to an operational creditor who merely“claims” a right to payment of a liability or obligation in respect ofa debt which may be due – In view thereof, the differentiation in thetriggering of insolvency resolution process by financial creditorsu/s. 7 and by operational creditors u/ss. 8 and 9 becomes clear –Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India (Information Utilities)Regulations, 2017 – Insolvency and Bankruptcy (Application toAdjudicating Authority) Rules, 2016 – Form I. ss. 21, 24, 28 and 30(2)(b) r/w s. 31 – Operational creditors– Right to vote in the committee of creditors – Plea that operationalcreditor do not have even a single vote in committee of creditors –Held: Financial creditors are best equipped to assess viability andfeasibility of the business of the corporate debtor and evaluate thecontents of a resolution plan – On the other hand, operationalcreditors, who provide goods and services, are involved only inrecovering amounts that are paid for such goods and services, andare typically unable to assess viability and feasibility of business –Resolution plan cannot pass muster u/s. 30(2)(b) rw s. 31 unless aminimum payment is made to operational creditors, being not lessthan liquidation value – Regulation 38 strengthens the rights ofoperational creditors by statutorily incorporating the principle offair and equitable dealing of operational creditors’ rights, togetherwith priority in payment over financial creditors – Thus, theoperational creditors are not discriminated against nor Art. 14 hasbeen infracted either on the ground of equals being treated unequallyor on the ground of manifest arbitrariness – Insolvency andBankruptcy Board of India (Insolvency Resolution Process forCorporate Persons) Regulations, 2016 – Regulation 38 –Constitution of India – Art. 14.ss.12A(as amended) and 60 – s. 12A wherein withdrawal ofapplication admitted u/ss 7, 9 or 10, with approval of ninety percent voting shares of the committee of creditors – s. 12A if violativeof Art. 14 – Held: s. 12A is not violative of Art. 14 – ILC Report hasexplained that as all financial creditors have to put their headstogether to allow such withdrawal as, ordinarily, an omnibussettlement involving all creditors ought, ideally, to be entered into –In any case, the figure of ninety per cent, in the absence of anythingfurther to show that it is arbitrary, must pertain to the domain oflegislative policy – Also, if the committee of creditors arbitrarilyrejects a just settlement and/or withdrawal claim, the NCLT, andthereafter, the NCLAT can always set aside such decision u/s. 60 –Insolvency and Bankruptcy (Second Amendment) Act, 2018 –Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India (Insolvency ResolutionProcess for Corporate Persons) Regulations, 2016 – Reg 30A.s. 210 – Private Information Utilities – Evidence providedby private information utilities – Plea that Private Information Utilities not governed by proper norms and evidence of loan defaultin records of such utility not conclusive evidence – Held: Regulations20 and 21 makes it clear that apart from the stringent requirementsas to registration of such utility, the moment information of defaultis received, such information has to be communicated to all partiesand sureties to the debt and an information utility shall expeditiouslyundertake the process of authentication and verification ofinformation – Evidence provided by private information utilities isonly prima facie evidence of default which is rebuttable by thecorporate debtor – Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India(Insolvency Resolution Process for Corporate Persons) Regulations,2016 – Regulations 20 and 21ss. 18, 41, 42 and 28 – Resolution professional – Adjudicatorypower, under the Code and the Regulations – Held: It is clear fromthe Code as well as the Regulations that the resolution professionalhas no adjudicatory powers – Resolution professional is givenadministrative as opposed to quasi-judicial powers – Even whenthe resolution professional is to make a “determination” underRegulation 35A, he is only to apply to the Adjudicating Authorityfor appropriate relief based on the determination made – Thus, theresolution professional is really a facilitator of the resolution process,whose administrative functions are overseen by the committee ofcreditors and by the Adjudicating Authority – Insolvency andBankruptcy Board of India (Insolvency Resolution Process forCorporate Persons) Regulations, 2016 – Regulations 10, 12, 13,14, and 35A.s. 29A(as amended) – Retrospective application – Submissionthat vested rights of erstwhile promoters to participate in the recoveryprocess of a corporate debtor have been impaired by retrospectiveapplication of s. 29A – Held: A statute is not retrospective merelybecause it affects existing rights or merely because a part of therequisites for its action is drawn from a time antecedent to its passing– Resolution applicant has no vested right for consideration orapproval of its resolution plan – By application of s. 29A, no vestedright is taken away – Since a resolution applicant who applies u/s.29A(c) has no vested right to apply for being considered as aresolution applicant, submission cannot be accepted. s. 29A and s.35(1)(f) proviso – s. 29A if restricted tomalfeasance – Submission that s. 29A puts a blanket ban onparticipation of all promoters of corporate debtors, without anymechanism to weed out the unscrupulous as against the efficientmanager but who have not been able to pay off their debts due toother reasons – Held: s. 29A not restricted to malfeasance –Legislative purpose which permeates s. 29A continues to permeatethe Section when it applies not merely to resolution applicants, butto liquidation also.s. 29(A)(c) – One year period in s. 29A – Non-performingasset – Plea that u/s. 29A(c), a person’s account may be classifiedas a non- performing asset even though he is not a wilful defaulter;and that the period of one year referred in clause (c) is whollyarbitrary and without any basis either in rationality or in law –Held: A person is a defaulter when an installment and/or intereston the principal remains overdue for more than three months, afterwhich, its account is declared NPA – During the period of one yearthereafter, this grace period is given to such person to pay off thedebt – If a person is unable to repay a loan taken, in whole or inpart, within this period of one year and three months, he would beineligible to become a resolution applicant – This legislative policycannot be found fault with – Neither can the period of one year befound fault with.ss. 29A(j) and 5(24A) – Related party – Plea that personswho may be relatives of erstwhile promoters are debarred frombecoming a resolution applicant – Held: Persons who act jointly orin concert with others are connected with the business activity ofthe resolution applicant – Similarly, all the categories of personsmentioned in s. 5(24A) show that such persons must be “connected”with the resolution applicant within the meaning of s. 29A(j) – Thus,the said categories of persons who are collectively mentioned underthe caption “relative” obviously need to have a connection with thebusiness activity of the resolution applicant – In the absence ofshowing that such person is “connected” with the business of theactivity of the resolution applicant, such person cannot possibly bedisqualified u/s. 29A(j) – Explanation I clause (ii) to s. 29A(j) makesit clear that if a person is otherwise covered as a “connected person”,this provision would also cover a person who is in management orcontrol of the business of the corporate debtor during the implementation of a resolution plan – Thus, any such person is notindeterminate at all, but is a person who is in the saddle of thebusiness of the corporate debtor either at an anterior point of timeor even during implementation of the resolution plan.s. 29A – Exemption of micro, small and medium enterprisesfrom s. 29A – Justification of – Held: Justified – Rationale forexcluding such industries from the eligibility criteria laid down inss. 29A(c) and 29A(h) is because qua such industries, otherresolution applicants may not be forthcoming, which then willinevitably lead not to resolution, but to liquidation – Micro, Smalland Medium Enterprises Development Act, 2006 – s. 7.s. 53 – Distribution of assets – Submission that in the event ofliquidation, operational creditors would never get anything as theyrank below all other creditors, including other unsecured creditorswho happen to be financial creditors, thus s. 53(1)(f) discriminatoryand arbitrary thus, violative of Art. 14 – Held: s. 53 does not violateArt. 14 – Repayment of financial debts infuses capital into theeconomy inasmuch as banks and financial institutions are able,with the money that has been paid back, to further lend such moneyto other entrepreneurs for their businesses – This rationale createsan intelligible differentia between financial debts and operationaldebts, which are unsecured, which is directly related to the objectsought to be achieved by the Code – So long as there is somelegitimate interest sought to be protected, having relation to theobject sought to be achieved by the statute, Art. 14 does not getinfracted – Constitution of India – Art. 14.Object and reasons for the Code – Explained.Enactment and working of the Code – Explained.Companies Act, 2013: s. 412 – Selection of members oftribunal and appellate tribunal – Plea that appointment of membersof the NCLT and the NCLAT contrary to Madras Bar Association(III)’s case – s. 412 whereby members of the tribunal and appellatetribunal to be selected, two judicial members of the SelectionCommittee get outweighed by three bureaucrats – Held: s. 412 hasbeen amended by the Companies Amendment Act, 2017 – Presentmembers of NCLT and NCLAT have been appointed by the SelectionCommittee, reconstituted in compliance with the direction of thisCourt. Judiciary: NCLAT Bench – Creation of Circuit Benches –Submission that NCLAT Bench has a seat only at New Delhi and iscontrary to the judgment in Madras Bar Association (II) case –Held: In view of the assurance by the Attorney General that CircuitBenches would be established soon, issuance of direction to Unionof India to set up Circuit Benches of the NCLAT within the stipulatedperiod.Constitution of India: Art. 77 – Submission that the tribunals-NCLT and NCLAT are functioning under the wrong Ministry-Ministryof Corporate Affairs, however, as per the Madras Bar Association(I)case the administrative support for all the tribunals should be fromthe Ministry of Law and Justice – Held: Rules of business beingmandatory in nature and having to be followed, are to be followedby the executive branch of the Government – However, this Court isbeing bound by the Madras Bar Association(I), the Union of Indiato follow the judgment, both in letter and spirit.",

Classificationbetween financial creditor and operational creditor – Whetherdiscriminatory, arbitrary, and violative of Art. 14 – Held: Preservingthe corporate debtor as a going concern, while ensuring maximumrecovery for all creditors being the objective of the Code, financialcreditors are clearly different from operational creditors – Thus,there is an intelligible differentia between the two which has a directrelation to the objects sought to be achieved by the Code – Thus,there is no discrimination – Constitution of India – Art. 14.ss. 3, 3(9)(c), 214(e), 60, 65, 75, 7, 8 and 9 – Notice, hearing,and set-off or counterclaim qua financial debts – Triggering ofinsolvency resolution process by financial creditors and operationalcreditors – Submission that the difference in the triggering processat behest of financial creditors and operational creditors isdiscriminatory and arbitrary – Held: A financial creditor has toprove “default” as opposed to an operational creditor who merely“claims” a right to payment of a liability or obligation in respect ofa debt which may be due – In view thereof, the differentiation in thetriggering of insolvency resolution process by financial creditorsu/s. 7 and by operational creditors u/ss. 8 and 9 becomes clear –Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India (Information Utilities)Regulations, 2017 – Insolvency and Bankruptcy (Application toAdjudicating Authority) Rules, 2016 – Form I. ss. 21, 24, 28 and 30(2)(b) r/w s. 31 – Operational creditors– Right to vote in the committee of creditors – Plea that operationalcreditor do not have even a single vote in committee of creditors –Held: Financial creditors are best equipped to assess viability andfeasibility of the business of the corporate debtor and evaluate thecontents of a resolution plan – On the other hand, operationalcreditors, who provide goods and services, are involved only inrecovering amounts that are paid for such goods and services, andare typically unable to assess viability and feasibility of business –Resolution plan cannot pass muster u/s. 30(2)(b) rw s. 31 unless aminimum payment is made to operational creditors, being not lessthan liquidation value – Regulation 38 strengthens the rights ofoperational creditors by statutorily incorporating the principle offair and equitable dealing of operational creditors’ rights, togetherwith priority in payment over financial creditors – Thus, theoperational creditors are not discriminated against nor Art. 14 hasbeen infracted either on the ground of equals being treated unequallyor on the ground of manifest arbitrariness – Insolvency andBankruptcy Board of India (Insolvency Resolution Process forCorporate Persons) Regulations, 2016 – Regulation 38 –Constitution of India – Art. 14.ss.12A(as amended) and 60 – s. 12A wherein withdrawal ofapplication admitted u/ss 7, 9 or 10, with approval of ninety percent voting shares of the committee of creditors – s. 12A if violativeof Art. 14 – Held: s. 12A is not violative of Art. 14 – ILC Report hasexplained that as all financial creditors have to put their headstogether to allow such withdrawal as, ordinarily, an omnibussettlement involving all creditors ought, ideally, to be entered into –In any case, the figure of ninety per cent, in the absence of anythingfurther to show that it is arbitrary, must pertain to the domain oflegislative policy – Also, if the committee of creditors arbitrarilyrejects a just settlement and/or withdrawal claim, the NCLT, andthereafter, the NCLAT can always set aside such decision u/s. 60 –Insolvency and Bankruptcy (Second Amendment) Act, 2018 –Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India (Insolvency ResolutionProcess for Corporate Persons) Regulations, 2016 – Reg 30A.s. 210 – Private Information Utilities – Evidence providedby private information utilities – Plea that Private Information Utilities not governed by proper norms and evidence of loan defaultin records of such utility not conclusive evidence – Held: Regulations20 and 21 makes it clear that apart from the stringent requirementsas to registration of such utility, the moment information of defaultis received, such information has to be communicated to all partiesand sureties to the debt and an information utility shall expeditiouslyundertake the process of authentication and verification ofinformation – Evidence provided by private information utilities isonly prima facie evidence of default which is rebuttable by thecorporate debtor – Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India(Insolvency Resolution Process for Corporate Persons) Regulations,2016 – Regulations 20 and 21ss. 18, 41, 42 and 28 – Resolution professional – Adjudicatorypower, under the Code and the Regulations – Held: It is clear fromthe Code as well as the Regulations that the resolution professionalhas no adjudicatory powers – Resolution professional is givenadministrative as opposed to quasi-judicial powers – Even whenthe resolution professional is to make a “determination” underRegulation 35A, he is only to apply to the Adjudicating Authorityfor appropriate relief based on the determination made – Thus, theresolution professional is really a facilitator of the resolution process,whose administrative functions are overseen by the committee ofcreditors and by the Adjudicating Authority – Insolvency andBankruptcy Board of India (Insolvency Resolution Process forCorporate Persons) Regulations, 2016 – Regulations 10, 12, 13,14, and 35A.s. 29A(as amended) – Retrospective application – Submissionthat vested rights of erstwhile promoters to participate in the recoveryprocess of a corporate debtor have been impaired by retrospectiveapplication of s. 29A – Held: A statute is not retrospective merelybecause it affects existing rights or merely because a part of therequisites for its action is drawn from a time antecedent to its passing– Resolution applicant has no vested right for consideration orapproval of its resolution plan – By application of s. 29A, no vestedright is taken away – Since a resolution applicant who applies u/s.29A(c) has no vested right to apply for being considered as aresolution applicant, submission cannot be accepted. s. 29A and s.35(1)(f) proviso – s. 29A if restricted tomalfeasance – Submission that s. 29A puts a blanket ban onparticipation of all promoters of corporate debtors, without anymechanism to weed out the unscrupulous as against the efficientmanager but who have not been able to pay off their debts due toother reasons – Held: s. 29A not restricted to malfeasance –Legislative purpose which permeates s. 29A continues to permeatethe Section when it applies not merely to resolution applicants, butto liquidation also.s. 29(A)(c) – One year period in s. 29A – Non-performingasset – Plea that u/s. 29A(c), a person’s account may be classifiedas a non- performing asset even though he is not a wilful defaulter;and that the period of one year referred in clause (c) is whollyarbitrary and without any basis either in rationality or in law –Held: A person is a defaulter when an installment and/or intereston the principal remains overdue for more than three months, afterwhich, its account is declared NPA – During the period of one yearthereafter, this grace period is given to such person to pay off thedebt – If a person is unable to repay a loan taken, in whole or inpart, within this period of one year and three months, he would beineligible to become a resolution applicant – This legislative policycannot be found fault with – Neither can the period of one year befound fault with.ss. 29A(j) and 5(24A) – Related party – Plea that personswho may be relatives of erstwhile promoters are debarred frombecoming a resolution applicant – Held: Persons who act jointly orin concert with others are connected with the business activity ofthe resolution applicant – Similarly, all the categories of personsmentioned in s. 5(24A) show that such persons must be “connected”with the resolution applicant within the meaning of s. 29A(j) – Thus,the said categories of persons who are collectively mentioned underthe caption “relative” obviously need to have a connection with thebusiness activity of the resolution applicant – In the absence ofshowing that such person is “connected” with the business of theactivity of the resolution applicant, such person cannot possibly bedisqualified u/s. 29A(j) – Explanation I clause (ii) to s. 29A(j) makesit clear that if a person is otherwise covered as a “connected person”,this provision would also cover a person who is in management orcontrol of the business of the corporate debtor during the implementation of a resolution plan – Thus, any such person is notindeterminate at all, but is a person who is in the saddle of thebusiness of the corporate debtor either at an anterior point of timeor even during implementation of the resolution plan.s. 29A – Exemption of micro, small and medium enterprisesfrom s. 29A – Justification of – Held: Justified – Rationale forexcluding such industries from the eligibility criteria laid down inss. 29A(c) and 29A(h) is because qua such industries, otherresolution applicants may not be forthcoming, which then willinevitably lead not to resolution, but to liquidation – Micro, Smalland Medium Enterprises Development Act, 2006 – s. 7.s. 53 – Distribution of assets – Submission that in the event ofliquidation, operational creditors would never get anything as theyrank below all other creditors, including other unsecured creditorswho happen to be financial creditors, thus s. 53(1)(f) discriminatoryand arbitrary thus, violative of Art. 14 – Held: s. 53 does not violateArt. 14 – Repayment of financial debts infuses capital into theeconomy inasmuch as banks and financial institutions are able,with the money that has been paid back, to further lend such moneyto other entrepreneurs for their businesses – This rationale createsan intelligible differentia between financial debts and operationaldebts, which are unsecured, which is directly related to the objectsought to be achieved by the Code – So long as there is somelegitimate interest sought to be protected, having relation to theobject sought to be achieved by the statute, Art. 14 does not getinfracted – Constitution of India – Art. 14.Object and reasons for the Code – Explained.Enactment and working of the Code – Explained.Companies Act, 2013: s. 412 – Selection of members oftribunal and appellate tribunal – Plea that appointment of membersof the NCLT and the NCLAT contrary to Madras Bar Association(III)’s case – s. 412 whereby members of the tribunal and appellatetribunal to be selected, two judicial members of the SelectionCommittee get outweighed by three bureaucrats – Held: s. 412 hasbeen amended by the Companies Amendment Act, 2017 – Presentmembers of NCLT and NCLAT have been appointed by the SelectionCommittee, reconstituted in compliance with the direction of thisCourt. Judiciary: NCLAT Bench – Creation of Circuit Benches –Submission that NCLAT Bench has a seat only at New Delhi and iscontrary to the judgment in Madras Bar Association (II) case –Held: In view of the assurance by the Attorney General that CircuitBenches would be established soon, issuance of direction to Unionof India to set up Circuit Benches of the NCLAT within the stipulatedperiod.Constitution of India: Art. 77 – Submission that the tribunals-NCLT and NCLAT are functioning under the wrong Ministry-Ministryof Corporate Affairs, however, as per the Madras Bar Association(I)case the administrative support for all the tribunals should be fromthe Ministry of Law and Justice – Held: Rules of business beingmandatory in nature and having to be followed, are to be followedby the executive branch of the Government – However, this Court isbeing bound by the Madras Bar Association(I), the Union of Indiato follow the judgment, both in letter and spirit.",

Classificationbetween financial creditor and operational creditor – Whetherdiscriminatory, arbitrary, and violative of Art. 14 – Held: Preservingthe corporate debtor as a going concern, while ensuring maximumrecovery for all creditors being the objective of the Code, financialcreditors are clearly different from operational creditors – Thus,there is an intelligible differentia between the two which has a directrelation to the objects sought to be achieved by the Code – Thus,there is no discrimination – Constitution of India – Art. 14.ss. 3, 3(9)(c), 214(e), 60, 65, 75, 7, 8 and 9 – Notice, hearing,and set-off or counterclaim qua financial debts – Triggering ofinsolvency resolution process by financial creditors and operationalcreditors – Submission that the difference in the triggering processat behest of financial creditors and operational creditors isdiscriminatory and arbitrary – Held: A financial creditor has toprove “default” as opposed to an operational creditor who merely“claims” a right to payment of a liability or obligation in respect ofa debt which may be due – In view thereof, the differentiation in thetriggering of insolvency resolution process by financial creditorsu/s. 7 and by operational creditors u/ss. 8 and 9 becomes clear –Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India (Information Utilities)Regulations, 2017 – Insolvency and Bankruptcy (Application toAdjudicating Authority) Rules, 2016 – Form I. ss. 21, 24, 28 and 30(2)(b) r/w s. 31 – Operational creditors– Right to vote in the committee of creditors – Plea that operationalcreditor do not have even a single vote in committee of creditors –Held: Financial creditors are best equipped to assess viability andfeasibility of the business of the corporate debtor and evaluate thecontents of a resolution plan – On the other hand, operationalcreditors, who provide goods and services, are involved only inrecovering amounts that are paid for such goods and services, andare typically unable to assess viability and feasibility of business –Resolution plan cannot pass muster u/s. 30(2)(b) rw s. 31 unless aminimum payment is made to operational creditors, being not lessthan liquidation value – Regulation 38 strengthens the rights ofoperational creditors by statutorily incorporating the principle offair and equitable dealing of operational creditors’ rights, togetherwith priority in payment over financial creditors – Thus, theoperational creditors are not discriminated against nor Art. 14 hasbeen infracted either on the ground of equals being treated unequallyor on the ground of manifest arbitrariness – Insolvency andBankruptcy Board of India (Insolvency Resolution Process forCorporate Persons) Regulations, 2016 – Regulation 38 –Constitution of India – Art. 14.ss.12A(as amended) and 60 – s. 12A wherein withdrawal ofapplication admitted u/ss 7, 9 or 10, with approval of ninety percent voting shares of the committee of creditors – s. 12A if violativeof Art. 14 – Held: s. 12A is not violative of Art. 14 – ILC Report hasexplained that as all financial creditors have to put their headstogether to allow such withdrawal as, ordinarily, an omnibussettlement involving all creditors ought, ideally, to be entered into –In any case, the figure of ninety per cent, in the absence of anythingfurther to show that it is arbitrary, must pertain to the domain oflegislative policy – Also, if the committee of creditors arbitrarilyrejects a just settlement and/or withdrawal claim, the NCLT, andthereafter, the NCLAT can always set aside such decision u/s. 60 –Insolvency and Bankruptcy (Second Amendment) Act, 2018 –Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India (Insolvency ResolutionProcess for Corporate Persons) Regulations, 2016 – Reg 30A.s. 210 – Private Information Utilities – Evidence providedby private information utilities – Plea that Private Information Utilities not governed by proper norms and evidence of loan defaultin records of such utility not conclusive evidence – Held: Regulations20 and 21 makes it clear that apart from the stringent requirementsas to registration of such utility, the moment information of defaultis received, such information has to be communicated to all partiesand sureties to the debt and an information utility shall expeditiouslyundertake the process of authentication and verification ofinformation – Evidence provided by private information utilities isonly prima facie evidence of default which is rebuttable by thecorporate debtor – Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India(Insolvency Resolution Process for Corporate Persons) Regulations,2016 – Regulations 20 and 21ss. 18, 41, 42 and 28 – Resolution professional – Adjudicatorypower, under the Code and the Regulations – Held: It is clear fromthe Code as well as the Regulations that the resolution professionalhas no adjudicatory powers – Resolution professional is givenadministrative as opposed to quasi-judicial powers – Even whenthe resolution professional is to make a “determination” underRegulation 35A, he is only to apply to the Adjudicating Authorityfor appropriate relief based on the determination made – Thus, theresolution professional is really a facilitator of the resolution process,whose administrative functions are overseen by the committee ofcreditors and by the Adjudicating Authority – Insolvency andBankruptcy Board of India (Insolvency Resolution Process forCorporate Persons) Regulations, 2016 – Regulations 10, 12, 13,14, and 35A.s. 29A(as amended) – Retrospective application – Submissionthat vested rights of erstwhile promoters to participate in the recoveryprocess of a corporate debtor have been impaired by retrospectiveapplication of s. 29A – Held: A statute is not retrospective merelybecause it affects existing rights or merely because a part of therequisites for its action is drawn from a time antecedent to its passing– Resolution applicant has no vested right for consideration orapproval of its resolution plan – By application of s. 29A, no vestedright is taken away – Since a resolution applicant who applies u/s.29A(c) has no vested right to apply for being considered as aresolution applicant, submission cannot be accepted. s. 29A and s.35(1)(f) proviso – s. 29A if restricted tomalfeasance – Submission that s. 29A puts a blanket ban onparticipation of all promoters of corporate debtors, without anymechanism to weed out the unscrupulous as against the efficientmanager but who have not been able to pay off their debts due toother reasons – Held: s. 29A not restricted to malfeasance –Legislative purpose which permeates s. 29A continues to permeatethe Section when it applies not merely to resolution applicants, butto liquidation also.s. 29(A)(c) – One year period in s. 29A – Non-performingasset – Plea that u/s. 29A(c), a person’s account may be classifiedas a non- performing asset even though he is not a wilful defaulter;and that the period of one year referred in clause (c) is whollyarbitrary and without any basis either in rationality or in law –Held: A person is a defaulter when an installment and/or intereston the principal remains overdue for more than three months, afterwhich, its account is declared NPA – During the period of one yearthereafter, this grace period is given to such person to pay off thedebt – If a person is unable to repay a loan taken, in whole or inpart, within this period of one year and three months, he would beineligible to become a resolution applicant – This legislative policycannot be found fault with – Neither can the period of one year befound fault with.ss. 29A(j) and 5(24A) – Related party – Plea that personswho may be relatives of erstwhile promoters are debarred frombecoming a resolution applicant – Held: Persons who act jointly orin concert with others are connected with the business activity ofthe resolution applicant – Similarly, all the categories of personsmentioned in s. 5(24A) show that such persons must be “connected”with the resolution applicant within the meaning of s. 29A(j) – Thus,the said categories of persons who are collectively mentioned underthe caption “relative” obviously need to have a connection with thebusiness activity of the resolution applicant – In the absence ofshowing that such person is “connected” with the business of theactivity of the resolution applicant, such person cannot possibly bedisqualified u/s. 29A(j) – Explanation I clause (ii) to s. 29A(j) makesit clear that if a person is otherwise covered as a “connected person”,this provision would also cover a person who is in management orcontrol of the business of the corporate debtor during the implementation of a resolution plan – Thus, any such person is notindeterminate at all, but is a person who is in the saddle of thebusiness of the corporate debtor either at an anterior point of timeor even during implementation of the resolution plan.s. 29A – Exemption of micro, small and medium enterprisesfrom s. 29A – Justification of – Held: Justified – Rationale forexcluding such industries from the eligibility criteria laid down inss. 29A(c) and 29A(h) is because qua such industries, otherresolution applicants may not be forthcoming, which then willinevitably lead not to resolution, but to liquidation – Micro, Smalland Medium Enterprises Development Act, 2006 – s. 7.s. 53 – Distribution of assets – Submission that in the event ofliquidation, operational creditors would never get anything as theyrank below all other

typically unable to assess viability and feasibility of business –Resolution plan cannot pass muster u/s. 30(2)(b) rw s. 31 unless aminimum payment is made to operational creditors, being not lessthan liquidation value – Regulation 38 strengthens the rights ofoperational creditors by statutorily incorporating the principle offair and equitable dealing of operational creditors’ rights, togetherwith priority in payment over financial creditors – Thus, theoperational creditors are not discriminated against nor Art. 14 hasbeen infracted either on the ground of equals being treated unequallyor on the ground of manifest arbitrariness – Insolvency andBankruptcy Board of India (Insolvency Resolution Process forCorporate Persons) Regulations, 2016 – Regulation 38 –Constitution of India – Art. 14.ss.12A(as amended) and 60 – s. 12A wherein withdrawal ofapplication admitted u/ss 7, 9 or 10, with approval of ninety percent voting shares of the committee of creditors – s. 12A if violativeof Art. 14 – Held: s. 12A is not violative of Art. 14 – ILC Report hasexplained that as all financial creditors have to put their headstogether to allow such withdrawal as, ordinarily, an omnibussettlement involving all creditors ought, ideally, to be entered into –In any case, the figure of ninety per cent, in the absence of anythingfurther to show that it is arbitrary, must pertain to the domain oflegislative policy – Also, if the committee of creditors arbitrarilyrejects a just settlement and/or withdrawal claim, the NCLT, andthereafter, the NCLAT can always set aside such decision u/s. 60 –Insolvency and Bankruptcy (Second Amendment) Act, 2018 –Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India (Insolvency ResolutionProcess for Corporate Persons) Regulations, 2016 – Reg 30A.s. 210 – Private Information Utilities – Evidence providedby private information utilities – Plea that Private Information Utilities not governed by proper norms and evidence of loan defaultin records of such utility not conclusive evidence – Held: Regulations20 and 21 makes it clear that apart from the stringent requirementsas to registration of such utility, the moment information of defaultis received, such information has to be communicated to all partiesand sureties to the debt and an information utility shall expeditiouslyundertake the process of authentication and verification ofinformation – Evidence provided by private information utilities isonly prima facie evidence of default which is rebuttable by thecorporate debtor – Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India(Insolvency Resolution Process for Corporate Persons) Regulations,2016 – Regulations 20 and 21ss. 18, 41, 42 and 28 – Resolution professional – Adjudicatorypower, under the Code and the Regulations – Held: It is clear fromthe Code as well as the Regulations that the resolution professionalhas no adjudicatory powers – Resolution professional is givenadministrative as opposed to quasi-judicial powers – Even whenthe resolution professional is to make a “determination” underRegulation 35A, he is only to apply to the Adjudicating Authorityfor appropriate relief based on the determination made – Thus, theresolution professional is really a facilitator of the resolution process,whose administrative functions are overseen by the committee ofcreditors and by the Adjudicating Authority – Insolvency andBankruptcy Board of India (Insolvency Resolution Process forCorporate Persons) Regulations, 2016 – Regulations 10, 12, 13,14, and 35A.s. 29A(as amended) – Retrospective application – Submissionthat vested rights of erstwhile promoters to participate in the recoveryprocess of a corporate debtor have been impaired by retrospectiveapplication of s. 29A – Held: A statute is not retrospective merelybecause it affects existing rights or merely because a part of therequisites for its action is drawn from a time antecedent to its passing– Resolution applicant has no vested right for consideration orapproval of its resolution plan – By application of s. 29A, no vestedright is taken away – Since a resolution applicant who applies u/s.29A(c) has no vested right to apply for being considered as aresolution applicant, submission cannot be accepted. s. 29A and s.35(1)(f) proviso – s. 29A if restricted tomalfeasance – Submission that s. 29A puts a blanket ban onparticipation of all promoters of corporate debtors, without anymechanism to weed out the unscrupulous as against the efficientmanager but who have not been able to pay off their debts due toother reasons – Held: s. 29A not restricted to malfeasance –Legislative purpose which permeates s. 29A continues to permeatethe Section when it applies not merely to resolution applicants, butto liquidation also.s. 29(A)(c) – One year period in s. 29A – Non-performingasset – Plea that u/s. 29A(c), a person’s account may be classifiedas a non- performing asset even though he is not a wilful defaulter;and that the period of one year referred in clause (c) is whollyarbitrary and without any basis either in rationality or in law –Held: A person is a defaulter when an installment and/or intereston the principal remains overdue for more than three months, afterwhich, its account is declared NPA – During the period of one yearthereafter, this grace period is given to such person to pay off thedebt – If a person is unable to repay a loan taken, in whole or inpart, within this period of one year and three months, he would beineligible to become a resolution applicant – This legislative policycannot be found fault with – Neither can the period of one year befound fault with.ss. 29A(j) and 5(24A) – Related party – Plea that personswho may be relatives of erstwhile promoters are debarred frombecoming a resolution applicant – Held: Persons who act jointly orin concert with others are connected with the business activity ofthe resolution applicant – Similarly, all the categories of personsmentioned in s. 5(24A) show that such persons must be “connected”with the resolution applicant within the meaning of s. 29A(j) – Thus,the said categories of persons who are collectively mentioned underthe caption “relative” obviously need to have a connection with thebusiness activity of the resolution applicant – In the absence ofshowing that such person is “connected” with the business of theactivity of the resolution applicant, such person cannot possibly bedisqualified u/s. 29A(j) – Explanation I clause (ii) to s. 29A(j) makesit clear that if a person is otherwise covered as a “connected person”,this provision would also cover a person who is in management orcontrol of the business of the corporate debtor during the implementation of a resolution plan – Thus, any such person is notindeterminate at all, but is a person who is in the saddle of thebusiness of the corporate debtor either at an anterior point of timeor even during implementation of the resolution plan.s. 29A – Exemption of micro, small and medium enterprisesfrom s. 29A – Justification of – Held: Justified – Rationale forexcluding such industries from the eligibility criteria laid down inss. 29A(c) and 29A(h) is because qua such industries, otherresolution applicants may not be forthcoming, which then willinevitably lead not to resolution, but to liquidation – Micro, Smalland Medium Enterprises Development Act, 2006 – s. 7.s. 53 – Distribution of assets – Submission that in the event ofliquidation, operational creditors would never get anything as theyrank below all other creditors, including other unsecured creditorswho happen to be financial creditors, thus s. 53(1)(f) discriminatoryand arbitrary thus, violative of Art. 14 – Held: s. 53 does not violateArt. 14 – Repayment of financial debts infuses capital into theeconomy inasmuch as banks and financial institutions are able,with the money that has been paid back, to further lend such moneyto other entrepreneurs for their businesses – This rationale createsan intelligible differentia between financial debts and operationaldebts, which are unsecured, which is directly related to the objectsought to be achieved by the Code – So long as there is somelegitimate interest sought to be protected, having relation to theobject sought to be achieved by the statute, Art. 14 does not getinfracted – Constitution of India – Art. 14.Object and reasons for the Code – Explained.Enactment and working of the Code – Explained.Companies Act, 2013: s. 412 – Selection of members oftribunal and appellate tribunal – Plea that appointment of membersof the NCLT and the NCLAT contrary to Madras Bar Association(III)’s case – s. 412 whereby members of the tribunal and appellatetribunal to be selected, two judicial members of the SelectionCommittee get outweighed by three bureaucrats – Held: s. 412 hasbeen amended by the Companies Amendment Act, 2017 – Presentmembers of NCLT and NCLAT have been appointed by the SelectionCommittee, reconstituted in compliance with the direction of thisCourt. Judiciary: NCLAT Bench – Creation of Circuit Benches –Submission that NCLAT Bench has a seat only at New Delhi and iscontrary to the judgment in Madras Bar Association (II) case –Held: In view of the assurance by the Attorney General that CircuitBenches would be established soon, issuance of direction to Unionof India to set up Circuit Benches of the NCLAT within the stipulatedperiod.Constitution of India: Art. 77 – Submission that the tribunals-NCLT and NCLAT are functioning under the wrong Ministry-Ministryof Corporate Affairs, however, as per the Madras Bar Association(I)case the administrative support for all the tribunals should be fromthe Ministry of Law and Justice – Held: Rules of business beingmandatory in nature and having to be followed, are to be followedby the executive branch of the Government – However, this Court isbeing bound by the Madras Bar Association(I), the Union of Indiato follow the judgment, both in letter and spirit.",

        "HeadNote": "Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016:Constitutional validity of – Held: Provisions of the Code passesconstitutional muster.ss. 5(7), 5(8), 5(20), 7(1), 7(4), 7(5), 8 and 9 – Classificationbetween financial creditor and operational creditor – Whetherdiscriminatory, arbitrary, and violative of Art. 14 – Held: Preservingthe corporate debtor as a going concern, while ensuring maximumrecovery for all creditors being the objective of the Code, financialcreditors are clearly different from operational creditors – Thus,there is an intelligible differentia between the two which has a directrelation to the objects sought to be achieved by the Code – Thus,there is no discrimination – Constitution of India – Art. 14.ss. 3, 3(9)(c), 214(e), 60, 65, 75, 7, 8 and 9 – Notice, hearing,and set-off or counterclaim qua financial debts – Triggering ofinsolvency resolution process by financial creditors and operationalcreditors – Submission that the difference in the triggering processat behest of financial creditors and operational creditors isdiscriminatory and arbitrary – Held: A financial creditor has toprove “default” as opposed to an operational creditor who merely“claims” a right to payment of a liability or obligation in respect ofa debt which may be due – In view thereof, the differentiation in thetriggering of insolvency resolution process by financial creditorsu/s. 7 and by operational creditors u/ss. 8 and 9 becomes clear –Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India (Information Utilities)Regulations, 2017 – Insolvency and Bankruptcy (Application toAdjudicating Authority) Rules, 2016 – Form I. ss. 21, 24, 28 and 30(2)(b) r/w s. 31 – Operational creditors– Right to vote in the committee of creditors – Plea that operationalcreditor do not have even a single vote in committee of creditors –Held: Financial creditors are best equipped to assess viability andfeasibility of the business of the corporate debtor and evaluate thecontents of a resolution plan – On the other hand, operationalcreditors, who provide goods and services, are involved only inrecovering amounts that are paid for such goods and services, andare typically unable to assess viability and feasibility of business –Resolution plan cannot pass muster u/s. 30(2)(b) rw s. 31 unless aminimum payment is made to operational creditors, being not lessthan liquidation value – Regulation 38 strengthens the rights ofoperational creditors by statutorily incorporating the principle offair and equitable dealing of operational creditors’ rights, togetherwith priority in payment over financial creditors – Thus, theoperational creditors are not discriminated against nor Art. 14 hasbeen infracted either on the ground of equals being treated unequallyor on the ground of manifest arbitrariness – Insolvency andBankruptcy Board of India (Insolvency Resolution Process forCorporate Persons) Regulations, 2016 – Regulation 38 –Constitution of India – Art. 14.ss.12A(as amended) and 60 – s. 12A wherein withdrawal ofapplication admitted u/ss 7, 9 or 10, with approval of ninety percent voting shares of the committee of creditors – s. 12A if violativeof Art. 14 – Held: s. 12A is not violative of Art. 14 – ILC Report hasexplained that as all financial creditors have to put their headstogether to allow such withdrawal as, ordinarily, an omnibussettlement involving all creditors ought, ideally, to be entered into –In any case, the figure of ninety per cent, in the absence of anythingfurther to show that it is arbitrary, must pertain to the domain oflegislative policy – Also, if the committee of creditors arbitrarilyrejects a just settlement and/or withdrawal claim, the NCLT, andthereafter, the NCLAT can always set aside such decision u/s. 60 –Insolvency and Bankruptcy (Second Amendment) Act, 2018 –Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India (Insolvency ResolutionProcess for Corporate Persons) Regulations, 2016 – Reg 30A.s. 210 – Private Information Utilities – Evidence providedby private information utilities – Plea that Private Information Utilities not governed by proper norms and evidence of loan defaultin records of such utility not conclusive evidence – Held: Regulations20 and 21 makes it clear that apart from the stringent requirementsas to registration of such utility, the moment information of defaultis received, such information has to be communicated to all partiesand sureties to the debt and an information utility shall expeditiouslyundertake the process of authentication and verification ofinformation – Evidence provided by private information utilities isonly prima facie evidence of default which is rebuttable by thecorporate debtor – Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India(Insolvency Resolution Process for Corporate Persons) Regulations,2016 – Regulations 20 and 21ss. 18, 41, 42 and 28 – Resolution professional – Adjudicatorypower, under the Code and the Regulations – Held: It is clear fromthe Code as well as the Regulations that the resolution professionalhas no adjudicatory powers – Resolution professional is givenadministrative as opposed to quasi-judicial powers – Even whenthe resolution professional is to make a “determination” underRegulation 35A, he is only to apply to the Adjudicating Authorityfor appropriate relief based on the determination made – Thus, theresolution professional is really a facilitator of the resolution process,whose administrative functions are overseen by the committee ofcreditors and by the Adjudicating Authority – Insolvency andBankruptcy Board of India (Insolvency Resolution Process forCorporate Persons) Regulations, 2016 – Regulations 10, 12, 13,14, and 35A.s. 29A(as amended) – Retrospective application – Submissionthat vested rights of erstwhile promoters to participate in the recoveryprocess of a corporate debtor have been impaired by retrospectiveapplication of s. 29A – Held: A statute is not retrospective merelybecause it affects existing rights or merely because a part of therequisites for its action is drawn from a time antecedent to its passing– Resolution applicant has no vested right for consideration orapproval of its resolution plan – By application of s. 29A, no vestedright is taken away – Since a resolution applicant who applies u/s.29A(c) has no vested right to apply for being considered as aresolution applicant, submission cannot be accepted. s. 29A and s.35(1)(f) proviso – s. 29A if restricted tomalfeasance – Submission that s. 29A puts a blanket ban onparticipation of all promoters of corporate debtors, without anymechanism to weed out the unscrupulous as against the efficientmanager but who have not been able to pay off their debts due toother reasons – Held: s. 29A not restricted to malfeasance –Legislative purpose which permeates s. 29A continues to permeatethe Section when it applies not merely to resolution applicants, butto liquidation also.s. 29(A)(c) – One year period in s. 29A – Non-performingasset – Plea that u/s. 29A(c), a person’s account may be classifiedas a non- performing asset even though he is not a wilful defaulter;and that the period of one year referred in clause (c) is whollyarbitrary and without any basis either in rationality or in law –Held: A person is a defaulter when an installment and/or intereston the principal remains overdue for more than three months, afterwhich, its account is declared NPA – During the period of one yearthereafter, this grace period is given to such person to pay off thedebt – If a person is unable to repay a loan taken, in whole or inpart, within this period of one year and three months, he would beineligible to become a resolution applicant – This legislative policycannot be found fault with – Neither can the period of one year befound fault with.ss. 29A(j) and 5(24A) – Related party – Plea that personswho may be relatives of erstwhile promoters are debarred frombecoming a resolution applicant – Held: Persons who act jointly orin concert with others are connected with the business activity ofthe resolution applicant – Similarly, all the categories of personsmentioned in s. 5(24A) show that such persons must be “connected”with the resolution applicant within the meaning of s. 29A(j) – Thus,the said categories of persons who are collectively mentioned underthe caption “relative” obviously need to have a connection with thebusiness activity of the resolution applicant – In the absence ofshowing that such person is “connected” with the business of theactivity of the resolution applicant, such person cannot possibly bedisqualified u/s. 29A(j) – Explanation I clause (ii) to s. 29A(j) makesit clear that if a person is otherwise covered as a “connected person”,this provision would also cover a person who is in management orcontrol of the business of the corporate debtor during the implementation of a resolution plan – Thus, any such person is notindeterminate at all, but is a person who is in the saddle of thebusiness of the corporate debtor either at an anterior point of timeor even during implementation of the resolution plan.s. 29A – Exemption of micro, small and medium enterprisesfrom s. 29A – Justification of – Held: Justified – Rationale forexcluding such industries from the eligibility criteria laid down inss. 29A(c) and 29A(h) is because qua such industries, otherresolution applicants may not be forthcoming, which then willinevitably lead not to resolution, but to liquidation – Micro, Smalland Medium Enterprises Development Act, 2006 – s. 7.s. 53 – Distribution of assets – Submission that in the event ofliquidation, operational creditors would never get anything as theyrank below all other creditors, including other unsecured creditorswho happen to be financial creditors, thus s. 53(1)(f) discriminatoryand arbitrary thus, violative of Art. 14 – Held: s. 53 does not violateArt. 14 – Repayment of financial debts infuses capital into theeconomy inasmuch as banks and financial institutions are able,with the money that has been paid back, to further lend such moneyto other entrepreneurs for their businesses – This rationale createsan intelligible differentia between financial debts and operationaldebts, which are unsecured, which is directly related to the objectsought to be achieved by the Code – So long as there is somelegitimate interest sought to be protected, having relation to theobject sought to be achieved by the statute, Art. 14 does not getinfracted – Constitution of India – Art. 14.Object and reasons for the Code – Explained.Enactment and working of the Code – Explained.Companies Act, 2013: s. 412 – Selection of members oftribunal and appellate tribunal – Plea that appointment of membersof the NCLT and the NCLAT contrary to Madras Bar Association(III)’s case – s. 412 whereby members of the tribunal and appellatetribunal to be selected, two judicial members of the SelectionCommittee get outweighed by three bureaucrats – Held: s. 412 hasbeen amended by the Companies Amendment Act, 2017 – Presentmembers of NCLT and NCLAT have been appointed by the SelectionCommittee, reconstituted in compliance with the direction of thisCourt. Judiciary: NCLAT Bench – Creation of Circuit Benches –Submission that NCLAT Bench has a seat only at New Delhi and iscontrary to the judgment in Madras Bar Association (II) case –Held: In view of the assurance by the Attorney General that CircuitBenches would be established soon, issuance of direction to Unionof India to set up Circuit Benches of the NCLAT within the stipulatedperiod.Constitution of India: Art. 77 – Submission that the tribunals-NCLT and NCLAT are functioning under the wrong Ministry-Ministryof Corporate Affairs, however, as per the Madras Bar Association(I)case the administrative support for all the tribunals should be fromthe Ministry of Law and Justice – Held: Rules of business beingmandatory in nature and having to be followed, are to be followedby the executive branch of the Government – However, this Court isbeing bound by the Madras Bar Association(I), the Union of Indiato follow the judgment, both in letter and spirit.",

Classificationbetween financial creditor and operational creditor – Whetherdiscriminatory, arbitrary, and violative of Art. 14 – Held: Preservingthe corporate debtor as a going concern, while ensuring maximumrecovery for all creditors being the objective of the Code, financialcreditors are clearly different from operational creditors – Thus,there is an intelligible differentia between the two which has a directrelation to the objects sought to be achieved by the Code – Thus,there is no discrimination – Constitution of India – Art. 14.ss. 3, 3(9)(c), 214(e), 60, 65, 75, 7, 8 and 9 – Notice, hearing,and set-off or counterclaim qua financial debts – Triggering ofinsolvency resolution process by financial creditors and operationalcreditors – Submission that the difference in the triggering processat behest of financial creditors and operational creditors isdiscriminatory and arbitrary – Held: A financial creditor has toprove “default” as opposed to an operational creditor who merely“claims” a right to payment of a liability or obligation in respect ofa debt which may be due – In view thereof, the differentiation in thetriggering of insolvency resolution process by financial creditorsu/s. 7 and by operational creditors u/ss. 8 and 9 becomes clear –Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India (Information Utilities)Regulations, 2017 – Insolvency and Bankruptcy (Application toAdjudicating Authority) Rules, 2016 – Form I. ss. 21, 24, 28 and 30(2)(b) r/w s. 31 – Operational creditors– Right to vote in the committee of creditors – Plea that operationalcreditor do not have even a single vote in committee of creditors –Held: Financial creditors are best equipped to assess viability andfeasibility of the business of the corporate debtor and evaluate thecontents of a resolution plan – On the other hand, operationalcreditors, who provide goods and services, are involved only inrecovering amounts that are paid for such goods and services, andare typically unable to assess viability and feasibility of business –Resolution plan cannot pass muster u/s. 30(2)(b) rw s. 31 unless aminimum payment is made to operational creditors, being not lessthan liquidation value – Regulation 38 strengthens the rights ofoperational creditors by statutorily incorporating the principle offair and equitable dealing of operational creditors’ rights, togetherwith priority in payment over financial creditors – Thus, theoperational creditors are not discriminated against nor Art. 14 hasbeen infracted either on the ground of equals being treated unequallyor on the ground of manifest arbitrariness – Insolvency andBankruptcy Board of India (Insolvency Resolution Process forCorporate Persons) Regulations, 2016 – Regulation 38 –Constitution of India – Art. 14.ss.12A(as amended) and 60 – s. 12A wherein withdrawal ofapplication admitted u/ss 7, 9 or 10, with approval of ninety percent voting shares of the committee of creditors – s. 12A if violativeof Art. 14 – Held: s. 12A is not violative of Art. 14 – ILC Report hasexplained that as all financial creditors have to put their headstogether to allow such withdrawal as, ordinarily, an omnibussettlement involving all creditors ought, ideally, to be entered into –In any case, the figure of ninety per cent, in the absence of anythingfurther to show that it is arbitrary, must pertain to the domain oflegislative policy – Also, if the committee of creditors arbitrarilyrejects a just settlement and/or withdrawal claim, the NCLT, andthereafter, the NCLAT can always set aside such decision u/s. 60 –Insolvency and Bankruptcy (Second Amendment) Act, 2018 –Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India (Insolvency ResolutionProcess for Corporate Persons) Regulations, 2016 – Reg 30A.s. 210 – Private Information Utilities – Evidence providedby private information utilities – Plea that Private Information Utilities not governed by proper norms and evidence of loan defaultin records of such utility not conclusive evidence – Held: Regulations20 and 21 makes it clear that apart from the stringent requirementsas to registration of such utility, the moment information of defaultis received, such information has to be communicated to all partiesand sureties to the debt and an information utility shall expeditiouslyundertake the process of authentication and verification ofinformation – Evidence provided by private information utilities isonly prima facie evidence of default which is rebuttable by thecorporate debtor – Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India(Insolvency Resolution Process for Corporate Persons) Regulations,2016 – Regulations 20 and 21ss. 18, 41, 42 and 28 – Resolution professional – Adjudicatorypower, under the Code and the Regulations – Held: It is clear fromthe Code as well as the Regulations that the resolution professionalhas no adjudicatory powers – Resolution professional is givenadministrative as opposed to quasi-judicial powers – Even whenthe resolution professional is to make a “determination” underRegulation 35A, he is only to apply to the Adjudicating Authorityfor appropriate relief based on the determination made – Thus, theresolution professional is really a facilitator of the resolution process,whose administrative functions are overseen by the committee ofcreditors and by the Adjudicating Authority – Insolvency andBankruptcy Board of India (Insolvency Resolution Process forCorporate Persons) Regulations, 2016 – Regulations 10, 12, 13,14, and 35A.s. 29A(as amended) – Retrospective application – Submissionthat vested rights of erstwhile promoters to participate in the recoveryprocess of a corporate debtor have been impaired by retrospectiveapplication of s. 29A – Held: A statute is not retrospective merelybecause it affects existing rights or merely because a part of therequisites for its action is drawn from a time antecedent to its passing– Resolution applicant has no vested right for consideration orapproval of its resolution plan – By application of s. 29A, no vestedright is taken away – Since a resolution applicant who applies u/s.29A(c) has no vested right to apply for being considered as aresolution applicant, submission cannot be accepted. s. 29A and s.35(1)(f) proviso – s. 29A if restricted tomalfeasance – Submission that s. 29A puts a blanket ban onparticipation of all promoters of corporate debtors, without anymechanism to weed out the unscrupulous as against the efficientmanager but who have not been able to pay off their debts due toother reasons – Held: s. 29A not restricted to malfeasance –Legislative purpose which permeates s. 29A continues to permeatethe Section when it applies not merely to resolution applicants, butto liquidation also.s. 29(A)(c) – One year period in s. 29A – Non-performingasset – Plea that u/s. 29A(c), a person’s account may be classifiedas a non- performing asset even though he is not a wilful defaulter;and that the period of one year referred in clause (c) is whollyarbitrary and without any basis either in rationality or in law –Held: A person is a defaulter when an installment and/or intereston the principal remains overdue for more than three months, afterwhich, its account is declared NPA – During the period of one yearthereafter, this grace period is given to such person to pay off thedebt – If a person is unable to repay a loan taken, in whole or inpart, within this period of one year and three months, he would beineligible to become a resolution applicant – This legislative policycannot be found fault with – Neither can the period of one year befound fault with.ss. 29A(j) and 5(24A) – Related party – Plea that personswho may be relatives of erstwhile promoters are debarred frombecoming a resolution applicant – Held: Persons who act jointly orin concert with others are connected with the business activity ofthe resolution applicant – Similarly, all the categories of personsmentioned in s. 5(24A) show that such persons must be “connected”with the resolution applicant within the meaning of s. 29A(j) – Thus,the said categories of persons who are collectively mentioned underthe caption “relative” obviously need to have a connection with thebusiness activity of the resolution applicant – In the absence ofshowing that such person is “connected” with the business of theactivity of the resolution applicant, such person cannot possibly bedisqualified u/s. 29A(j) – Explanation I clause (ii) to s. 29A(j) makesit clear that if a person is otherwise covered as a “connected person”,this provision would also cover a person who is in management orcontrol of the business of the corporate debtor during the implementation of a resolution plan – Thus, any such person is notindeterminate at all, but is a person who is in the saddle of thebusiness of the corporate debtor either at an anterior point of timeor even during implementation of the resolution plan.s. 29A – Exemption of micro, small and medium enterprisesfrom s. 29A – Justification of – Held: Justified – Rationale forexcluding such industries from the eligibility criteria laid down inss. 29A(c) and 29A(h) is because qua such industries, otherresolution applicants may not be forthcoming, which then willinevitably lead not to resolution, but to liquidation – Micro, Smalland Medium Enterprises Development Act, 2006 – s. 7.s. 53 – Distribution of assets – Submission that in the event ofliquidation, operational creditors would never get anything as theyrank below all other creditors, including other unsecured creditorswho happen to be financial creditors, thus s. 53(1)(f) discriminatoryand arbitrary thus, violative of Art. 14 – Held: s. 53 does not violateArt. 14 – Repayment of financial debts infuses capital into theeconomy inasmuch as banks and financial institutions are able,with the money that has been paid back, to further lend such moneyto other entrepreneurs for their businesses – This rationale createsan intelligible differentia between financial debts and operationaldebts, which are unsecured, which is directly related to the objectsought to be achieved by the Code – So long as there is somelegitimate interest sought to be protected, having relation to theobject sought to be achieved by the statute, Art. 14 does not getinfracted – Constitution of India – Art. 14.Object and reasons for the Code – Explained.Enactment and working of the Code – Explained.Companies Act, 2013: s. 412 – Selection of members oftribunal and appellate tribunal – Plea that appointment of membersof the NCLT and the NCLAT contrary to Madras Bar Association(III)’s case – s. 412 whereby members of the tribunal and appellatetribunal to be selected, two judicial members of the SelectionCommittee get outweighed by three bureaucrats – Held: s. 412 hasbeen amended by the Companies Amendment Act, 2017 – Presentmembers of NCLT and NCLAT have been appointed by the SelectionCommittee, reconstituted in compliance with the direction of thisCourt. Judiciary: NCLAT Bench – Creation of Circuit Benches –Submission that NCLAT Bench has a seat only at New Delhi and iscontrary to the judgment in Madras Bar Association (II) case –Held: In view of the assurance by the Attorney General that CircuitBenches would be established soon, issuance of direction to Unionof India to set up Circuit Benches of the NCLAT within the stipulatedperiod.Constitution of India: Art. 77 – Submission that the tribunals-NCLT and NCLAT are functioning under the wrong Ministry-Ministryof Corporate Affairs, however, as per the Madras Bar Association(I)case the administrative support for all the tribunals should be fromthe Ministry of Law and Justice – Held: Rules of business beingmandatory in nature and having to be followed, are to be followedby the executive branch of the Government – However, this Court isbeing bound by the Madras Bar Association(I), the Union of Indiato follow the judgment, both in letter and spirit.",

Classificationbetween financial creditor and operational creditor – Whetherdiscriminatory, arbitrary, and violative of Art. 14 – Held: Preservingthe corporate debtor as a going concern, while ensuring maximumrecovery for all creditors being the objective of the Code, financialcreditors are clearly different from operational creditors – Thus,there is an intelligible differentia between the two which has a directrelation to the objects sought to be achieved by the Code – Thus,there is no discrimination – Constitution of India – Art. 14.ss. 3, 3(9)(c), 214(e), 60, 65, 75, 7, 8 and 9 – Notice, hearing,and set-off or counterclaim qua financial debts – Triggering ofinsolvency resolution process by financial creditors and operationalcreditors – Submission that the difference in the triggering processat behest of financial creditors and operational creditors isdiscriminatory and arbitrary – Held: A financial creditor has toprove “default” as opposed to an operational creditor who merely“claims” a right to payment of a liability or obligation in respect ofa debt which may be due – In view thereof, the differentiation in thetriggering of insolvency resolution process by financial creditorsu/s. 7 and by operational creditors u/ss. 8 and 9 becomes clear –Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India (Information Utilities)Regulations, 2017 – Insolvency and Bankruptcy (Application toAdjudicating Authority) Rules, 2016 – Form I. ss. 21, 24, 28 and 30(2)(b) r/w s. 31 – Operational creditors– Right to vote in the committee of creditors – Plea that operationalcreditor do not have even a single vote in committee of creditors –Held: Financial creditors are best equipped to assess viability andfeasibility of the business of the corporate debtor and evaluate thecontents of a resolution plan – On the other hand, operationalcreditors, who provide goods and services, are involved only inrecovering amounts that are paid for such goods and services, andare typically unable to assess viability and feasibility of business –Resolution plan cannot pass muster u/s. 30(2)(b) rw s. 31 unless aminimum payment is made to operational creditors, being not lessthan liquidation value – Regulation 38 strengthens the rights ofoperational creditors by statutorily incorporating the principle offair and equitable dealing of operational creditors’ rights, togetherwith priority in payment over financial creditors – Thus, theoperational creditors are not discriminated against nor Art. 14 hasbeen infracted either on the ground of equals being treated unequallyor on the ground of manifest arbitrariness – Insolvency andBankruptcy Board of India (Insolvency Resolution Process forCorporate Persons) Regulations, 2016 – Regulation 38 –Constitution of India – Art. 14.ss.12A(as amended) and 60 – s. 12A wherein withdrawal ofapplication admitted u/ss 7, 9 or 10, with approval of ninety percent voting shares of the committee of creditors – s. 12A if violativeof Art. 14 – Held: s. 12A is not violative of Art. 14 – ILC Report hasexplained that as all financial creditors have to put their headstogether to allow such withdrawal as, ordinarily, an omnibussettlement involving all creditors ought, ideally, to be entered into –In any case, the figure of ninety per cent, in the absence of anythingfurther to show that it is arbitrary, must pertain to the domain oflegislative policy – Also, if the committee of creditors arbitrarilyrejects a just settlement and/or withdrawal claim, the NCLT, andthereafter, the NCLAT can always set aside such decision u/s. 60 –Insolvency and Bankruptcy (Second Amendment) Act, 2018 –Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India (Insolvency ResolutionProcess for Corporate Persons) Regulations, 2016 – Reg 30A.s. 210 – Private Information Utilities – Evidence providedby private information utilities – Plea that Private Information Utilities not governed by proper norms and evidence of loan defaultin records of such utility not conclusive evidence – Held: Regulations20 and 21 makes it clear that apart from the stringent requirementsas to registration of such utility, the moment information of defaultis received, such information has to be communicated to all partiesand sureties to the debt and an information utility shall expeditiouslyundertake the process of authentication and verification ofinformation – Evidence provided by private information utilities isonly prima facie evidence of default which is rebuttable by thecorporate debtor – Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India(Insolvency Resolution Process for Corporate Persons) Regulations,2016 – Regulations 20 and 21ss. 18, 41, 42 and 28 – Resolution professional – Adjudicatorypower, under the Code and the Regulations – Held: It is clear fromthe Code as well as the Regulations that the resolution professionalhas no adjudicatory powers – Resolution professional is givenadministrative as opposed to quasi-judicial powers – Even whenthe resolution professional is to make a “determination” underRegulation 35A, he is only to apply to the Adjudicating Authorityfor appropriate relief based on the determination made – Thus, theresolution professional is really a facilitator of the resolution process,whose administrative functions are overseen by the committee ofcreditors and by the Adjudicating Authority – Insolvency andBankruptcy Board of India (Insolvency Resolution Process forCorporate Persons) Regulations, 2016 – Regulations 10, 12, 13,14, and 35A.s. 29A(as amended) – Retrospective application – Submissionthat vested rights of erstwhile promoters to participate in the recoveryprocess of a corporate debtor have been impaired by retrospectiveapplication of s. 29A – Held: A statute is not retrospective merelybecause it affects existing rights or merely because a part of therequisites for its action is drawn from a time antecedent to its passing– Resolution applicant has no vested right for consideration orapproval of its resolution plan – By application of s. 29A, no vestedright is taken away – Since a resolution applicant who applies u/s.29A(c) has no vested right to apply for being considered as aresolution applicant, submission cannot be accepted. s. 29A and s.35(1)(f) proviso – s. 29A if restricted tomalfeasance – Submission that s. 29A puts a blanket ban onparticipation of all promoters of corporate debtors, without anymechanism to weed out the unscrupulous as against the efficientmanager but who have not been able to pay off their debts due toother reasons – Held: s. 29A not restricted to malfeasance –Legislative purpose which permeates s. 29A continues to permeatethe Section when it applies not merely to resolution applicants, butto liquidation also.s. 29(A)(c) – One year period in s. 29A – Non-performingasset – Plea that u/s. 29A(c), a person’s account may be classifiedas a non- performing asset even though he is not a wilful defaulter;and that the period of one year referred in clause (c) is whollyarbitrary and without any basis either in rationality or in law –Held: A person is a defaulter when an installment and/or intereston the principal remains overdue for more than three months, afterwhich, its account is declared NPA – During the period of one yearthereafter, this grace period is given to such person to pay off thedebt – If a person is unable to repay a loan taken, in whole or inpart, within this period of one year and three months, he would beineligible to become a resolution applicant – This legislative policycannot be found fault with – Neither can the period of one year befound fault with.ss. 29A(j) and 5(24A) – Related party – Plea that personswho may be relatives of erstwhile promoters are debarred frombecoming a resolution applicant – Held: Persons who act jointly orin concert with others are connected with the business activity ofthe resolution applicant – Similarly, all the categories of personsmentioned in s. 5(24A) show that such persons must be “connected”with the resolution applicant within the meaning of s. 29A(j) – Thus,the said categories of persons who are collectively mentioned underthe caption “relative” obviously need to have a connection with thebusiness activity of the resolution applicant – In the absence ofshowing that such person is “connected” with the business of theactivity of the resolution applicant, such person cannot possibly bedisqualified u/s. 29A(j) – Explanation I clause (ii) to s. 29A(j) makesit clear that if a person is otherwise covered as a “connected person”,this provision would also cover a person who is in management orcontrol of the business of the corporate debtor during the implementation of a resolution plan – Thus, any such person is notindeterminate at all, but is a person who is in the saddle of thebusiness of the corporate debtor either at an anterior point of timeor even during implementation of the resolution plan.s. 29A – Exemption of micro, small and medium enterprisesfrom s. 29A – Justification of – Held: Justified – Rationale forexcluding such industries from the eligibility criteria laid down inss. 29A(c) and 29A(h) is because qua such industries, otherresolution applicants may not be forthcoming, which then willinevitably lead not to resolution, but to liquidation – Micro, Smalland Medium Enterprises Development Act, 2006 – s. 7.s. 53 – Distribution of assets – Submission that in the event ofliquidation, operational creditors would never get anything as theyrank below all other creditors, including other unsecured creditorswho happen to be financial creditors, thus s. 53(1)(f) discriminatoryand arbitrary thus, violative of Art. 14 – Held: s. 53 does not violateArt. 14 – Repayment of financial debts infuses capital into theeconomy inasmuch as banks and financial institutions are able,with the money that has been paid back, to further lend such moneyto other entrepreneurs for their businesses – This rationale createsan intelligible differentia between financial debts and operationaldebts, which are unsecured, which is directly related to the objectsought to be achieved by the Code – So long as there is somelegitimate interest sought to be protected, having relation to theobject sought to be achieved by the statute, Art. 14 does not getinfracted – Constitution of India – Art. 14.Object and reasons for the Code – Explained.Enactment and working of the Code – Explained.Companies Act, 2013: s. 412 – Selection of members oftribunal and appellate tribunal – Plea that appointment of membersof the NCLT and the NCLAT contrary to Madras Bar Association(III)’s case – s. 412 whereby members of the tribunal and appellatetribunal to be selected, two judicial members of the SelectionCommittee get outweighed by three bureaucrats – Held: s. 412 hasbeen amended by the Companies Amendment Act, 2017 – Presentmembers of NCLT and NCLAT have been appointed by the SelectionCommittee, reconstituted in compliance with the direction of thisCourt. Judiciary: NCLAT Bench – Creation of Circuit Benches –Submission that NCLAT Bench has a seat only at New Delhi and iscontrary to the judgment in Madras Bar Association (II) case –Held: In view of the assurance by the Attorney General that CircuitBenches would be established soon, issuance of direction to Unionof India to set up Circuit Benches of the NCLAT within the stipulatedperiod.Constitution of India: Art. 77 – Submission that the tribunals-NCLT and NCLAT are functioning under the wrong Ministry-Ministryof Corporate Affairs, however, as per the Madras Bar Association(I)case the administrative support for all the tribunals should be fromthe Ministry of Law and Justice – Held: Rules of business beingmandatory in nature and having to be followed, are to be followedby the executive branch of the Government – However, this Court isbeing bound by the Madras Bar Association(I), the Union of Indiato follow the judgment, both in letter and spirit.",

Classificationbetween financial creditor and operational creditor – Whetherdiscriminatory, arbitrary, and violative of Art. 14 – Held: Preservingthe corporate debtor as a going concern, while ensuring maximumrecovery for all creditors being the objective of the Code, financialcreditors are clearly different from operational creditors – Thus,there is an intelligible differentia between the two which has a directrelation to the objects sought to be achieved by the Code – Thus,there is no discrimination – Constitution of India – Art. 14.ss. 3, 3(9)(c), 214(e), 60, 65, 75, 7, 8 and 9 – Notice, hearing,and set-off or counterclaim qua financial debts – Triggering ofinsolvency resolution process by financial creditors and operationalcreditors – Submission that the difference in the triggering processat behest of financial creditors and operational creditors isdiscriminatory and arbitrary – Held: A financial creditor has toprove “default” as opposed to an operational creditor who merely“claims” a right to payment of a liability or obligation in respect ofa debt which may be due – In view thereof, the differentiation in thetriggering of insolvency resolution process by financial creditorsu/s. 7 and by operational creditors u/ss. 8 and 9 becomes clear –Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India (Information Utilities)Regulations, 2017 – Insolvency and Bankruptcy (Application toAdjudicating Authority) Rules, 2016 – Form I. ss. 21, 24, 28 and 30(2)(b) r/w s. 31 – Operational creditors– Right to vote in the committee of creditors – Plea that operationalcreditor do not have even a single vote in committee of creditors –Held: Financial creditors are best equipped to assess viability andfeasibility of the business of the corporate debtor and evaluate thecontents of a resolution plan – On the other hand, operationalcreditors, who provide goods and services, are involved only inrecovering amounts that are paid for such goods and services, andare typically unable to assess viability and feasibility of business –Resolution plan cannot pass muster u/s. 30(2)(b) rw s. 31 unless aminimum payment is made to operational creditors, being not lessthan liquidation value – Regulation 38 strengthens the rights ofoperational creditors by statutorily incorporating the principle offair and equitable dealing of operational creditors’ rights, togetherwith priority in payment over financial creditors – Thus, theoperational creditors are not discriminated against nor Art. 14 hasbeen infracted either on the ground of equals being treated unequallyor on the ground of manifest arbitrariness – Insolvency andBankruptcy Board of India (Insolvency Resolution Process forCorporate Persons) Regulations, 2016 – Regulation 38 –Constitution of India – Art. 14.ss.12A(as amended) and 60 – s. 12A wherein withdrawal ofapplication admitted u/ss 7, 9 or 10, with approval of ninety percent voting shares of the committee of creditors – s. 12A if violativeof Art. 14 – Held: s. 12A is not violative of Art. 14 – ILC Report hasexplained that as all financial creditors have to put their headstogether to allow such withdrawal as, ordinarily, an omnibussettlement involving all creditors ought, ideally, to be entered into –In any case, the figure of ninety per cent, in the absence of anythingfurther to show that it is arbitrary, must pertain to the domain oflegislative policy – Also, if the committee of creditors arbitrarilyrejects a just settlement and/or withdrawal claim, the NCLT, andthereafter, the NCLAT can always set aside such decision u/s. 60 –Insolvency and Bankruptcy (Second Amendment) Act, 2018 –Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India (Insolvency ResolutionProcess for Corporate Persons) Regulations, 2016 – Reg 30A.s. 210 – Private Information Utilities – Evidence providedby private information utilities – Plea that Private Information Utilities not governed by proper norms and evidence of loan defaultin records of such utility not conclusive evidence – Held: Regulations20 and 21 makes it clear that apart from the stringent requirementsas to registration of such utility, the moment information of defaultis received, such information has to be communicated to all partiesand sureties to the debt and an information utility shall expeditiouslyundertake the process of authentication and verification ofinformation – Evidence provided by private information utilities isonly prima facie evidence of default which is rebuttable by thecorporate debtor – Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India(Insolvency Resolution Process for Corporate Persons) Regulations,2016 – Regulations 20 and 21ss. 18, 41, 42 and 28 – Resolution professional – Adjudicatorypower, under the Code and the Regulations – Held: It is clear fromthe Code as well as the Regulations that the resolution professionalhas no adjudicatory powers – Resolution professional is givenadministrative as opposed to quasi-judicial powers – Even whenthe resolution professional is to make a “determination” underRegulation 35A, he is only to apply to the Adjudicating Authorityfor appropriate relief based on the determination made – Thus, theresolution professional is really a facilitator of the resolution process,whose administrative functions are overseen by the committee ofcreditors and by the Adjudicating Authority – Insolvency andBankruptcy Board of India (Insolvency Resolution Process forCorporate Persons) Regulations, 2016 – Regulations 10, 12, 13,14, and 35A.s. 29A(as amended) – Retrospective application – Submissionthat vested rights of erstwhile promoters to participate in the recoveryprocess of a corporate debtor have been impaired by retrospectiveapplication of s. 29A – Held: A statute is not retrospective merelybecause it affects existing rights or merely because a part of therequisites for its action is drawn from a time antecedent to its passing– Resolution applicant has no vested right for consideration orapproval of its resolution plan – By application of s. 29A, no vestedright is taken away – Since a resolution applicant who applies u/s.29A(c) has no vested right to apply for being considered as aresolution applicant, submission cannot be accepted. s. 29A and s.35(1)(f) proviso – s. 29A if restricted tomalfeasance – Submission that s. 29A puts a blanket ban onparticipation of all promoters of corporate debtors, without anymechanism to weed out the unscrupulous as against the efficientmanager but who have not been able to pay off their debts due toother reasons – Held: s. 29A not restricted to malfeasance –Legislative purpose which permeates s. 29A continues to permeatethe Section when it applies not merely to resolution applicants, butto liquidation also.s. 29(A)(c) – One year period in s. 29A – Non-performingasset – Plea that u/s. 29A(c), a person’s account may be classifiedas a non- performing asset even though he is not a wilful defaulter;and that the period of one year referred in clause (c) is whollyarbitrary and without any basis either in rationality or in law –Held: A person is a defaulter when an installment and/or intereston the principal remains overdue for more than three months, afterwhich, its account is declared NPA – During the period of one yearthereafter, this grace period is given to such person to pay off thedebt – If a person is unable to repay a loan taken, in whole or inpart, within this period of one year and three months, he would beineligible to become a resolution applicant – This legislative policycannot be found fault with – Neither can the period of one year befound fault with.ss. 29A(j) and 5(24A) – Related party – Plea that personswho may be relatives of erstwhile promoters are debarred frombecoming a resolution applicant – Held: Persons who act jointly orin concert with others are connected with the business activity ofthe resolution applicant – Similarly, all the categories of personsmentioned in s. 5(24A) show that such persons must be “connected”with the resolution applicant within the meaning of s. 29A(j) – Thus,the said categories of persons who are collectively mentioned underthe caption “relative” obviously need to have a connection with thebusiness activity of the resolution applicant – In the absence ofshowing that such person is “connected” with the business of theactivity of the resolution applicant, such person cannot possibly bedisqualified u/s. 29A(j) – Explanation I clause (ii) to s. 29A(j) makesit clear that if a person is otherwise covered as a “connected person”,this provision would also cover a person who is in management orcontrol of the business of the corporate debtor during the implementation of a resolution plan – Thus, any such person is notindeterminate at all, but is a person who is in the saddle of thebusiness of the corporate debtor either at an anterior point of timeor even during implementation of the resolution plan.s. 29A – Exemption of micro, small and medium enterprisesfrom s. 29A – Justification of – Held: Justified – Rationale forexcluding such industries from the eligibility criteria laid down inss. 29A(c) and 29A(h) is because qua such industries, otherresolution applicants may not be forthcoming, which then willinevitably lead not to resolution, but to liquidation – Micro, Smalland Medium Enterprises Development Act, 2006 – s. 7.s. 53 – Distribution of assets – Submission that in the event ofliquidation, operational creditors would never get anything as theyrank below all other creditors, including other unsecured creditorswho happen to be financial creditors, thus s. 53(1)(f) discriminatoryand arbitrary thus, violative of Art. 14 – Held: s. 53 does not violateArt. 14 – Repayment of financial debts infuses capital into theeconomy inasmuch as banks and financial institutions are able,with the money that has been paid back, to further lend such moneyto other entrepreneurs for their businesses – This rationale createsan intelligible differentia between financial debts and operationaldebts, which are unsecured, which is directly related to the objectsought to be achieved by the Code – So long as there is somelegitimate interest sought to be protected, having relation to theobject sought to be achieved by the statute, Art. 14 does not getinfracted – Constitution of India – Art. 14.Object and reasons for the Code – Explained.Enactment and working of the Code – Explained.Companies Act, 2013: s. 412 – Selection of members oftribunal and appellate tribunal – Plea that appointment of membersof the NCLT and the NCLAT contrary to Madras Bar Association(III)’s case – s. 412 whereby members of the tribunal and appellatetribunal to be selected, two judicial members of the SelectionCommittee get outweighed by three bureaucrats – Held: s. 412 hasbeen amended by the Companies Amendment Act, 2017 – Presentmembers of NCLT and NCLAT have been appointed by the SelectionCommittee, reconstituted in compliance with the direction of thisCourt. Judiciary: NCLAT Bench – Creation of Circuit Benches –Submission that NCLAT Bench has a seat only at New Delhi and iscontrary to the judgment in Madras Bar Association (II) case –Held: In view of the assurance by the Attorney General that CircuitBenches would be established soon, issuance of direction to Unionof India to set up Circuit Benches of the NCLAT within the stipulatedperiod.Constitution of India: Art. 77 – Submission that the tribunals-NCLT and NCLAT are functioning under the wrong Ministry-Ministryof Corporate Affairs, however, as per the Madras Bar Association(I)case the administrative support for all the tribunals should be fromthe Ministry of Law and Justice – Held: Rules of business beingmandatory in nature and having to be followed, are to be followedby the executive branch of the Government – However, this Court isbeing bound by the Madras Bar Association(I), the Union of Indiato follow the judgment, both in letter and spirit.",

        "HeadNote": "Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016:Constitutional validity of – Held: Provisions of the Code passesconstitutional muster.ss. 5(7), 5(8), 5(20), 7(1), 7(4), 7(5), 8 and 9 – Classificationbetween financial creditor and operational creditor – Whetherdiscriminatory, arbitrary, and violative of Art. 14 – Held: Preservingthe corporate debtor as a going concern, while ensuring maximumrecovery for all creditors being the objective of the Code, financialcreditors are clearly different from operational creditors – Thus,there is an intelligible differentia between the two which has a directrelation to the objects sought to be achieved by the Code – Thus,there is no discrimination – Constitution of India – Art. 14.ss. 3, 3(9)(c), 214(e), 60, 65, 75, 7, 8 and 9 – Notice, hearing,and set-off or counterclaim qua financial debts – Triggering ofinsolvency resolution process by financial creditors and operationalcreditors – Submission that the difference in the triggering processat behest of financial creditors and operational creditors isdiscriminatory and arbitrary – Held: A financial creditor has toprove “default” as opposed to an operational creditor who merely“claims” a right to payment of a liability or obligation in respect ofa debt which may be due – In view thereof, the differentiation in thetriggering of insolvency resolution process by financial creditorsu/s. 7 and by operational creditors u/ss. 8 and 9 becomes clear –Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India (Information Utilities)Regulations, 2017 – Insolvency and Bankruptcy (Application toAdjudicating Authority) Rules, 2016 – Form I. ss. 21, 24, 28 and 30(2)(b) r/w s. 31 – Operational creditors– Right to vote in the committee of creditors – Plea that operationalcreditor do not have even a single vote in committee of creditors –Held: Financial creditors are best equipped to assess viability andfeasibility of the business of the corporate debtor and evaluate thecontents of a resolution plan – On the other hand, operationalcreditors, who provide goods and services, are involved only inrecovering amounts that are paid for such goods and services, andare typically unable to assess viability and feasibility of business –Resolution plan cannot pass muster u/s. 30(2)(b) rw s. 31 unless aminimum payment is made to operational creditors, being not lessthan liquidation value – Regulation 38 strengthens the rights ofoperational creditors by statutorily incorporating the principle offair and equitable dealing of operational creditors’ rights, togetherwith priority in payment over financial creditors – Thus, theoperational creditors are not discriminated against nor Art. 14 hasbeen infracted either on the ground of equals being treated unequallyor on the ground of manifest arbitrariness – Insolvency andBankruptcy Board of India (Insolvency Resolution Process forCorporate Persons) Regulations, 2016 – Regulation 38 –Constitution of India – Art. 14.ss.12A(as amended) and 60 – s. 12A wherein withdrawal ofapplication admitted u/ss 7, 9 or 10, with approval of ninety percent voting shares of the committee of creditors – s. 12A if violativeof Art. 14 – Held: s. 12A is not violative of Art. 14 – ILC Report hasexplained that as all financial creditors have to put their headstogether to allow such withdrawal as, ordinarily, an omnibussettlement involving all creditors ought, ideally, to be entered into –In any case, the figure of ninety per cent, in the absence of anythingfurther to show that it is arbitrary, must pertain to the domain oflegislative policy – Also, if the committee of creditors arbitrarilyrejects a just settlement and/or withdrawal claim, the NCLT, andthereafter, the NCLAT can always set aside such decision u/s. 60 –Insolvency and Bankruptcy (Second Amendment) Act, 2018 –Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India (Insolvency ResolutionProcess for Corporate Persons) Regulations, 2016 – Reg 30A.s. 210 – Private Information Utilities – Evidence providedby private information utilities – Plea that Private Information Utilities not governed by proper norms and evidence of loan defaultin records of such utility not conclusive evidence – Held: Regulations20 and 21 makes it clear that apart from the stringent requirementsas to registration of such utility, the moment information of defaultis received, such information has to be communicated to all partiesand sureties to the debt and an information utility shall expeditiouslyundertake the process of authentication and verification ofinformation – Evidence provided by private information utilities isonly prima facie evidence of default which is rebuttable by thecorporate debtor – Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India(Insolvency Resolution Process for Corporate Persons) Regulations,2016 – Regulations 20 and 21ss. 18, 41, 42 and 28 – Resolution professional – Adjudicatorypower, under the Code and the Regulations – Held: It is clear fromthe Code as well as the Regulations that the resolution professionalhas no adjudicatory powers – Resolution professional is givenadministrative as opposed to quasi-judicial powers – Even whenthe resolution professional is to make a “determination” underRegulation 35A, he is only to apply to the Adjudicating Authorityfor appropriate relief based on the determination made – Thus, theresolution professional is really a facilitator of the resolution process,whose administrative functions are overseen by the committee ofcreditors and by the Adjudicating Authority – Insolvency andBankruptcy Board of India (Insolvency Resolution Process forCorporate Persons) Regulations, 2016 – Regulations 10, 12, 13,14, and 35A.s. 29A(as amended) – Retrospective application – Submissionthat vested rights of erstwhile promoters to participate in the recoveryprocess of a corporate debtor have been impaired by retrospectiveapplication of s. 29A – Held: A statute is not retrospective merelybecause it affects existing rights or merely because a part of therequisites for its action is drawn from a time antecedent to its passing– Resolution applicant has no vested right for consideration orapproval of its resolution plan – By application of s. 29A, no vestedright is taken away – Since a resolution applicant who applies u/s.29A(c) has no vested right to apply for being considered as aresolution applicant, submission cannot be accepted. s. 29A and s.35(1)(f) proviso – s. 29A if restricted tomalfeasance – Submission that s. 29A puts a blanket ban onparticipation of all promoters of corporate debtors, without anymechanism to weed out the unscrupulous as against the efficientmanager but who have not been able to pay off their debts due toother reasons – Held: s. 29A not restricted to malfeasance –Legislative purpose which permeates s. 29A continues to permeatethe Section when it applies not merely to resolution applicants, butto liquidation also.s. 29(A)(c) – One year period in s. 29A – Non-performingasset – Plea that u/s. 29A(c), a person’s account may be classifiedas a non- performing asset even though he is not a wilful defaulter;and that the period of one year referred in clause (c) is whollyarbitrary and without any basis either in rationality or in law –Held: A person is a defaulter when an installment and/or intereston the principal remains overdue for more than three months, afterwhich, its account is declared NPA – During the period of one yearthereafter, this grace period is given to such person to pay off thedebt – If a person is unable to repay a loan taken, in whole or inpart, within this period of one year and three months, he would beineligible to become a resolution applicant – This legislative policycannot be found fault with – Neither can the period of one year befound fault with.ss. 29A(j) and 5(24A) – Related party – Plea that personswho may be relatives of erstwhile promoters are debarred frombecoming a resolution applicant – Held: Persons who act jointly orin concert with others are connected with the business activity ofthe resolution applicant – Similarly, all the categories of personsmentioned in s. 5(24A) show that such persons must be “connected”with the resolution applicant within the meaning of s. 29A(j) – Thus,the said categories of persons who are collectively mentioned underthe caption “relative” obviously need to have a connection with thebusiness activity of the resolution applicant – In the absence ofshowing that such person is “connected” with the business of theactivity of the resolution applicant, such person cannot possibly bedisqualified u/s. 29A(j) – Explanation I clause (ii) to s. 29A(j) makesit clear that if a person is otherwise covered as a “connected person”,this provision would also cover a person who is in management orcontrol of the business of the corporate debtor during the implementation of a resolution plan – Thus, any such person is notindeterminate at all, but is a person who is in the saddle of thebusiness of the corporate debtor either at an anterior point of timeor even during implementation of the resolution plan.s. 29A – Exemption of micro, small and medium enterprisesfrom s. 29A – Justification of – Held: Justified – Rationale forexcluding such industries from the eligibility criteria laid down inss. 29A(c) and 29A(h) is because qua such industries, otherresolution applicants may not be forthcoming, which then willinevitably lead not to resolution, but to liquidation – Micro, Smalland Medium Enterprises Development Act, 2006 – s. 7.s. 53 – Distribution of assets – Submission that in the event ofliquidation, operational creditors would never get anything as theyrank below all other creditors, including other unsecured creditorswho happen to be financial creditors, thus s. 53(1)(f) discriminatoryand arbitrary thus, violative of Art. 14 – Held: s. 53 does not violateArt. 14 – Repayment of financial debts infuses capital into theeconomy inasmuch as banks and financial institutions are able,with the money that has been paid back, to further lend such moneyto other entrepreneurs for their businesses – This rationale createsan intelligible differentia between financial debts and operationaldebts, which are unsecured, which is directly related to the objectsought to be achieved by the Code – So long as there is somelegitimate interest sought to be protected, having relation to theobject sought to be achieved by the statute, Art. 14 does not getinfracted – Constitution of India – Art. 14.Object and reasons for the Code – Explained.Enactment and working of the Code – Explained.Companies Act, 2013: s. 412 – Selection of members oftribunal and appellate tribunal – Plea that appointment of membersof the NCLT and the NCLAT contrary to Madras Bar Association(III)’s case – s. 412 whereby members of the tribunal and appellatetribunal to be selected, two judicial members of the SelectionCommittee get outweighed by three bureaucrats – Held: s. 412 hasbeen amended by the Companies Amendment Act, 2017 – Presentmembers of NCLT and NCLAT have been appointed by the SelectionCommittee, reconstituted in compliance with the direction of thisCourt. Judiciary: NCLAT Bench – Creation of Circuit Benches –Submission that NCLAT Bench has a seat only at New Delhi and iscontrary to the judgment in Madras Bar Association (II) case –Held: In view of the assurance by the Attorney General that CircuitBenches would be established soon, issuance of direction to Unionof India to set up Circuit Benches of the NCLAT within the stipulatedperiod.Constitution of India: Art. 77 – Submission that the tribunals-NCLT and NCLAT are functioning under the wrong Ministry-Ministryof Corporate Affairs, however, as per the Madras Bar Association(I)case the administrative support for all the tribunals should be fromthe Ministry of Law and Justice – Held: Rules of business beingmandatory in nature and having to be followed, are to be followedby the executive branch of the Government – However, this Court isbeing bound by the Madras Bar Association(I), the Union of Indiato follow the judgment, both in letter and spirit.",

Classificationbetween financial creditor and operational creditor – Whetherdiscriminatory, arbitrary, and violative of Art. 14 – Held: Preservingthe corporate debtor as a going concern, while ensuring maximumrecovery for all creditors being the objective of the Code, financialcreditors are clearly different from operational creditors – Thus,there is an intelligible differentia between the two which has a directrelation to the objects sought to be achieved by the Code – Thus,there is no discrimination – Constitution of India – Art. 14.ss. 3, 3(9)(c), 214(e), 60, 65, 75, 7, 8 and 9 – Notice, hearing,and set-off or counterclaim qua financial debts – Triggering ofinsolvency resolution process by financial creditors and operationalcreditors – Submission that the difference in the triggering processat behest of financial creditors and operational creditors isdiscriminatory and arbitrary – Held: A financial creditor has toprove “default” as opposed to an operational creditor who merely“claims” a right to payment of a liability or obligation in respect ofa debt which may be due – In view thereof, the differentiation in thetriggering of insolvency resolution process by financial creditorsu/s. 7 and by operational creditors u/ss. 8 and 9 becomes clear –Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India (Information Utilities)Regulations, 2017 – Insolvency and Bankruptcy (Application toAdjudicating Authority) Rules, 2016 – Form I. ss. 21, 24, 28 and 30(2)(b) r/w s. 31 – Operational creditors– Right to vote in the committee of creditors – Plea that operationalcreditor do not have even a single vote in committee of creditors –Held: Financial creditors are best equipped to assess viability andfeasibility of the business of the corporate debtor and evaluate thecontents of a resolution plan – On the other hand, operationalcreditors, who provide goods and services, are involved only inrecovering amounts that are paid for such goods and services, andare typically unable to assess viability and feasibility of business –Resolution plan cannot pass muster u/s. 30(2)(b) rw s. 31 unless aminimum payment is made to operational creditors, being not lessthan liquidation value – Regulation 38 strengthens the rights ofoperational creditors by statutorily incorporating the principle offair and equitable dealing of operational creditors’ rights, togetherwith priority in payment over financial creditors – Thus, theoperational creditors are not discriminated against nor Art. 14 hasbeen infracted either on the ground of equals being treated unequallyor on the ground of manifest arbitrariness – Insolvency andBankruptcy Board of India (Insolvency Resolution Process forCorporate Persons) Regulations, 2016 – Regulation 38 –Constitution of India – Art. 14.ss.12A(as amended) and 60 – s. 12A wherein withdrawal ofapplication admitted u/ss 7, 9 or 10, with approval of ninety percent voting shares of the committee of creditors – s. 12A if violativeof Art. 14 – Held: s. 12A is not violative of Art. 14 – ILC Report hasexplained that as all financial creditors have to put their headstogether to allow such withdrawal as, ordinarily, an omnibussettlement involving all creditors ought, ideally, to be entered into –In any case, the figure of ninety per cent, in the absence of anythingfurther to show that it is arbitrary, must pertain to the domain oflegislative policy – Also, if the committee of creditors arbitrarilyrejects a just settlement and/or withdrawal claim, the NCLT, andthereafter, the NCLAT can always set aside such decision u/s. 60 –Insolvency and Bankruptcy (Second Amendment) Act, 2018 –Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India (Insolvency ResolutionProcess for Corporate Persons) Regulations, 2016 – Reg 30A.s. 210 – Private Information Utilities – Evidence providedby private information utilities – Plea that Private Information Utilities not governed by proper norms and evidence of loan defaultin records of such utility not conclusive evidence – Held: Regulations20 and 21 makes it clear that apart from the stringent requirementsas to registration of such utility, the moment information of defaultis received, such information has to be communicated to all partiesand sureties to the debt and an information utility shall expeditiouslyundertake the process of authentication and verification ofinformation – Evidence provided by private information utilities isonly prima facie evidence of default which is rebuttable by thecorporate debtor – Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India(Insolvency Resolution Process for Corporate Persons) Regulations,2016 – Regulations 20 and 21ss. 18, 41, 42 and 28 – Resolution professional – Adjudicatorypower, under the Code and the Regulations – Held: It is clear fromthe Code as well as the Regulations that the resolution professionalhas no adjudicatory powers – Resolution professional is givenadministrative as opposed to quasi-judicial powers – Even whenthe resolution professional is to make a “determination” underRegulation 35A, he is only to apply to the Adjudicating Authorityfor appropriate relief based on the determination made – Thus, theresolution professional is really a facilitator of the resolution process,whose administrative functions are overseen by the committee ofcreditors and by the Adjudicating Authority – Insolvency andBankruptcy Board of India (Insolvency Resolution Process forCorporate Persons) Regulations, 2016 – Regulations 10, 12, 13,14, and 35A.s. 29A(as amended) – Retrospective application – Submissionthat vested rights of erstwhile promoters to participate in the recoveryprocess of a corporate debtor have been impaired by retrospectiveapplication of s. 29A – Held: A statute is not retrospective merelybecause it affects existing rights or merely because a part of therequisites for its action is drawn from a time antecedent to its passing– Resolution applicant has no vested right for consideration orapproval of its resolution plan – By application of s. 29A, no vestedright is taken away – Since a resolution applicant who applies u/s.29A(c) has no vested right to apply for being considered as aresolution applicant, submission cannot be accepted. s. 29A and s.35(1)(f) proviso – s. 29A if restricted tomalfeasance – Submission that s. 29A puts a blanket ban onparticipation of all promoters of corporate debtors, without anymechanism to weed out the unscrupulous as against the efficientmanager but who have not been able to pay off their debts due toother reasons – Held: s. 29A not restricted to malfeasance –Legislative purpose which permeates s. 29A continues to permeatethe Section when it applies not merely to resolution applicants, butto liquidation also.s. 29(A)(c) – One year period in s. 29A – Non-performingasset – Plea that u/s. 29A(c), a person’s account may be classifiedas a non- performing asset even though he is not a wilful defaulter;and that the period of one year referred in clause (c) is whollyarbitrary and without any basis either in rationality or in law –Held: A person is a defaulter when an installment and/or intereston the principal remains overdue for more than three months, afterwhich, its account is declared NPA – During the period of one yearthereafter, this grace period is given to such person to pay off thedebt – If a person is unable to repay a loan taken, in whole or inpart, within this period of one year and three months, he would beineligible to become a resolution applicant – This legislative policycannot be found fault with – Neither can the period of one year befound fault with.ss. 29A(j) and 5(24A) – Related party – Plea that personswho may be relatives of erstwhile promoters are debarred frombecoming a resolution applicant – Held: Persons who act jointly orin concert with others are connected with the business activity ofthe resolution applicant – Similarly, all the categories of personsmentioned in s. 5(24A) show that such persons must be “connected”with the resolution applicant within the meaning of s. 29A(j) – Thus,the said categories of persons who are collectively mentioned underthe caption “relative” obviously need to have a connection with thebusiness activity of the resolution applicant – In the absence ofshowing that such person is “connected” with the business of theactivity of the resolution applicant, such person cannot possibly bedisqualified u/s. 29A(j) – Explanation I clause (ii) to s. 29A(j) makesit clear that if a person is otherwise covered as a “connected person”,this provision would also cover a person who is in management orcontrol of the business of the corporate debtor during the implementation of a resolution plan – Thus, any such person is notindeterminate at all, but is a person who is in the saddle of thebusiness of the corporate debtor either at an anterior point of timeor even during implementation of the resolution plan.s. 29A – Exemption of micro, small and medium enterprisesfrom s. 29A – Justification of – Held: Justified – Rationale forexcluding such industries from the eligibility criteria laid down inss. 29A(c) and 29A(h) is because qua such industries, otherresolution applicants may not be forthcoming, which then willinevitably lead not to resolution, but to liquidation – Micro, Smalland Medium Enterprises Development Act, 2006 – s. 7.s. 53 – Distribution of assets – Submission that in the event ofliquidation, operational creditors would never get anything as theyrank below all other creditors, including other unsecured creditorswho happen to be financial creditors, thus s. 53(1)(f) discriminatoryand arbitrary thus, violative of Art. 14 – Held: s. 53 does not violateArt. 14 – Repayment of financial debts infuses capital into theeconomy inasmuch as banks and financial institutions are able,with the money that has been paid back, to further lend such moneyto other entrepreneurs for their businesses – This rationale createsan intelligible differentia between financial debts and operationaldebts, which are unsecured, which is directly related to the objectsought to be achieved by the Code – So long as there is somelegitimate interest sought to be protected, having relation to theobject sought to be achieved by the statute, Art. 14 does not getinfracted – Constitution of India – Art. 14.Object and reasons for the Code – Explained.Enactment and working of the Code – Explained.Companies Act, 2013: s. 412 – Selection of members oftribunal and appellate tribunal – Plea that appointment of membersof the NCLT and the NCLAT contrary to Madras Bar Association(III)’s case – s. 412 whereby members of the tribunal and appellatetribunal to be selected, two judicial members of the SelectionCommittee get outweighed by three bureaucrats – Held: s. 412 hasbeen amended by the Companies Amendment Act, 2017 – Presentmembers of NCLT and NCLAT have been appointed by the SelectionCommittee, reconstituted in compliance with the direction of thisCourt. Judiciary: NCLAT Bench – Creation of Circuit Benches –Submission that NCLAT Bench has a seat only at New Delhi and iscontrary to the judgment in Madras Bar Association (II) case –Held: In view of the assurance by the Attorney General that CircuitBenches would be established soon, issuance of direction to Unionof India to set up Circuit Benches of the NCLAT within the stipulatedperiod.Constitution of India: Art. 77 – Submission that the tribunals-NCLT and NCLAT are functioning under the wrong Ministry-Ministryof Corporate Affairs, however, as per the Madras Bar Association(I)case the administrative support for all the tribunals should be fromthe Ministry of Law and Justice – Held: Rules of business beingmandatory in nature and having to be followed, are to be followedby the executive branch of the Government – However, this Court isbeing bound by the Madras Bar Association(I), the Union of Indiato follow the judgment, both in letter and spirit.",

Classificationbetween financial creditor and operational creditor – Whetherdiscriminatory, arbitrary, and violative of Art. 14 – Held: Preservingthe corporate debtor as a going concern, while ensuring maximumrecovery for all creditors being the objective of the Code, financialcreditors are clearly different from operational creditors – Thus,there is an intelligible differentia between the two which has a directrelation to the objects sought to be achieved by the Code – Thus,there is no discrimination – Constitution of India – Art. 14.ss. 3, 3(9)(c), 214(e), 60, 65, 75, 7, 8 and 9 – Notice, hearing,and set-off or counterclaim qua financial debts – Triggering ofinsolvency resolution process by financial creditors and operationalcreditors – Submission that the difference in the triggering processat behest of financial creditors and operational creditors isdiscriminatory and arbitrary – Held: A financial creditor has toprove “default” as opposed to an operational creditor who merely“claims” a right to payment of a liability or obligation in respect ofa debt which may be due – In view thereof, the differentiation in thetriggering of insolvency resolution process by financial creditorsu/s. 7 and by operational creditors u/ss. 8 and 9 becomes clear –Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India (Information Utilities)Regulations, 2017 – Insolvency and Bankruptcy (Application toAdjudicating Authority) Rules, 2016 – Form I. ss. 21, 24, 28 and 30(2)(b) r/w s. 31 – Operational creditors– Right to vote in the committee of creditors – Plea that operationalcreditor do not have even a single vote in committee of creditors –Held: Financial creditors are best equipped to assess viability andfeasibility of the business of the corporate debtor and evaluate thecontents of a resolution plan – On the other hand, operationalcreditors, who provide goods and services, are involved only inrecovering amounts that are paid for such goods and services, andare typically unable to assess viability and feasibility of business –Resolution plan cannot pass muster u/s. 30(2)(b) rw s. 31 unless aminimum payment is made to operational creditors, being not lessthan liquidation value – Regulation 38 strengthens the rights ofoperational creditors by statutorily incorporating the principle offair and equitable dealing of operational creditors’ rights, togetherwith priority in payment over financial creditors – Thus, theoperational creditors are not discriminated against nor Art. 14 hasbeen infracted either on the ground of equals being treated unequallyor on the ground of manifest arbitrariness – Insolvency andBankruptcy Board of India (Insolvency Resolution Process forCorporate Persons) Regulations, 2016 – Regulation 38 –Constitution of India – Art. 14.ss.12A(as amended) and 60 – s. 12A wherein withdrawal ofapplication admitted u/ss 7, 9 or 10, with approval of ninety percent voting shares of the committee of creditors – s. 12A if violativeof Art. 14 – Held: s. 12A is not violative of Art. 14 – ILC Report hasexplained that as all financial creditors have to put their headstogether to allow such withdrawal as, ordinarily, an omnibussettlement involving all creditors ought, ideally, to be entered into –In any case, the figure of ninety per cent, in the absence of anythingfurther to show that it is arbitrary, must pertain to the domain oflegislative policy – Also, if the committee of creditors arbitrarilyrejects a just settlement and/or withdrawal claim, the NCLT, andthereafter, the NCLAT can always set aside such decision u/s. 60 –Insolvency and Bankruptcy (Second Amendment) Act, 2018 –Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India (Insolvency ResolutionProcess for Corporate Persons) Regulations, 2016 – Reg 30A.s. 210 – Private Information Utilities – Evidence providedby private information utilities – Plea that Private Information Utilities not governed by proper norms and evidence of loan defaultin records of such utility not conclusive evidence – Held: Regulations20 and 21 makes it clear that apart from the stringent requirementsas to registration of such utility, the moment information of defaultis received, such information has to be communicated to all partiesand sureties to the debt and an information utility shall expeditiouslyundertake the process of authentication and verification ofinformation – Evidence provided by private information utilities isonly prima facie evidence of default which is rebuttable by thecorporate debtor – Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India(Insolvency Resolution Process for Corporate Persons) Regulations,2016 – Regulations 20 and 21ss. 18, 41, 42 and 28 – Resolution professional – Adjudicatorypower, under the Code and the Regulations – Held: It is clear fromthe Code as well as the Regulations that the resolution professionalhas no adjudicatory powers – Resolution professional is givenadministrative as opposed to quasi-judicial powers – Even whenthe resolution professional is to make a “determination” underRegulation 35A, he is only to apply to the Adjudicating Authorityfor appropriate relief based on the determination made – Thus, theresolution professional is really a facilitator of the resolution process,whose administrative functions are overseen by the committee ofcreditors and by the Adjudicating Authority – Insolvency andBankruptcy Board of India (Insolvency Resolution Process forCorporate Persons) Regulations, 2016 – Regulations 10, 12, 13,14, and 35A.s. 29A(as amended) – Retrospective application – Submissionthat vested rights of erstwhile promoters to participate in the recoveryprocess of a corporate debtor have been impaired by retrospectiveapplication of s. 29A – Held: A statute is not retrospective merelybecause it affects existing rights or merely because a part of therequisites for its action is drawn from a time antecedent to its passing– Resolution applicant has no vested right for consideration orapproval of its resolution plan – By application of s. 29A, no vestedright is taken away – Since a resolution applicant who applies u/s.29A(c) has no vested right to apply for being considered as aresolution applicant, submission cannot be accepted. s. 29A and s.35(1)(f) proviso – s. 29A if restricted tomalfeasance – Submission that s. 29A puts a blanket ban onparticipation of all promoters of corporate debtors, without anymechanism to weed out the unscrupulous as against the efficientmanager but who have not been able to pay off their debts due toother reasons – Held: s. 29A not restricted to malfeasance –Legislative purpose which permeates s. 29A continues to permeatethe Section when it applies not merely to resolution applicants, butto liquidation also.s. 29(A)(c) – One year period in s. 29A – Non-performingasset – Plea that u/s. 29A(c), a person’s account may be classifiedas a non- performing asset even though he is not a wilful defaulter;and that the period of one year referred in clause (c) is whollyarbitrary and without any basis either in rationality or in law –Held: A person is a defaulter when an installment and/or intereston the principal remains overdue for more than three months, afterwhich, its account is declared NPA – During the period of one yearthereafter, this grace period is given to such person to pay off thedebt – If a person is unable to repay a loan taken, in whole or inpart, within this period of one year and three months, he would beineligible to become a resolution applicant – This legislative policycannot be found fault with – Neither can the period of one year befound fault with.ss. 29A(j) and 5(24A) – Related party – Plea that personswho may be relatives of erstwhile promoters are debarred frombecoming a resolution applicant – Held: Persons who act jointly orin concert with others are connected with the business activity ofthe resolution applicant – Similarly, all the categories of personsmentioned in s. 5(24A) show that such persons must be “connected”with the resolution applicant within the meaning of s. 29A(j) – Thus,the said categories of persons who are collectively mentioned underthe caption “relative” obviously need to have a connection with thebusiness activity of the resolution applicant – In the absence ofshowing that such person is “connected” with the business of theactivity of the resolution applicant, such person cannot possibly bedisqualified u/s. 29A(j) – Explanation I clause (ii) to s. 29A(j) makesit clear that if a person is otherwise covered as a “connected person”,this provision would also cover a person who is in management orcontrol of the business of the corporate debtor during the implementation of a resolution plan – Thus, any such person is notindeterminate at all, but is a person who is in the saddle of thebusiness of the corporate debtor either at an anterior point of timeor even during implementation of the resolution plan.s. 29A – Exemption of micro, small and medium enterprisesfrom s. 29A – Justification of – Held: Justified – Rationale forexcluding such industries from the eligibility criteria laid down inss. 29A(c) and 29A(h) is because qua such industries, otherresolution applicants may not be forthcoming, which then willinevitably lead not to resolution, but to liquidation – Micro, Smalland Medium Enterprises Development Act, 2006 – s. 7.s. 53 – Distribution of assets – Submission that in the event ofliquidation, operational creditors would never get anything as theyrank below all other creditors, including other unsecured creditorswho happen to be financial creditors, thus s. 53(1)(f) discriminatoryand arbitrary thus, violative of Art. 14 – Held: s. 53 does not violateArt. 14 – Repayment of financial debts infuses capital into theeconomy inasmuch as banks and financial institutions are able,with the money that has been paid back, to further lend such moneyto other entrepreneurs for their businesses – This rationale createsan intelligible differentia between financial debts and operationaldebts, which are unsecured, which is directly related to the objectsought to be achieved by the Code – So long as there is somelegitimate interest sought to be protected, having relation to theobject sought to be achieved by the statute, Art. 14 does not getinfracted – Constitution of India – Art. 14.Object and reasons for the Code – Explained.Enactment and working of the Code – Explained.Companies Act, 2013: s. 412 – Selection of members oftribunal and appellate tribunal – Plea that appointment of membersof the NCLT and the NCLAT contrary to Madras Bar Association(III)’s case – s. 412 whereby members of the tribunal and appellatetribunal to be selected, two judicial members of the SelectionCommittee get outweighed by three bureaucrats – Held: s. 412 hasbeen amended by the Companies Amendment Act, 2017 – Presentmembers of NCLT and NCLAT have been appointed by the SelectionCommittee, reconstituted in compliance with the direction of thisCourt. Judiciary: NCLAT Bench – Creation of Circuit Benches –Submission that NCLAT Bench has a seat only at New Delhi and iscontrary to the judgment in Madras Bar Association (II) case –Held: In view of the assurance by the Attorney General that CircuitBenches would be established soon, issuance of direction to Unionof India to set up Circuit Benches of the NCLAT within the stipulatedperiod.Constitution of India: Art. 77 – Submission that the tribunals-NCLT and NCLAT are functioning under the wrong Ministry-Ministryof Corporate Affairs, however, as per the Madras Bar Association(I)case the administrative support for all the tribunals should be fromthe Ministry of Law and Justice – Held: Rules of business beingmandatory in nature and having to be followed, are to be followedby the executive branch of the Government – However, this Court isbeing bound by the Madras Bar Association(I), the Union of Indiato follow the judgment, both in letter and spirit.",

Classificationbetween financial creditor and operational creditor – Whetherdiscriminatory, arbitrary, and violative of Art. 14 – Held: Preservingthe corporate debtor as a going concern, while ensuring maximumrecovery for all creditors being the objective of the Code, financialcreditors are clearly different from operational creditors – Thus,there is an intelligible differentia between the two which has a directrelation to the objects sought to be achieved by the Code – Thus,there is no discrimination – Constitution of India – Art. 14.ss. 3, 3(9)(c), 214(e), 60, 65, 75, 7, 8 and 9 – Notice, hearing,and set-off or counterclaim qua financial debts – Triggering ofinsolvency resolution process by financial creditors and operationalcreditors – Submission that the difference in the triggering processat behest of financial creditors and operational creditors isdiscriminatory and arbitrary – Held: A financial creditor has toprove “default” as opposed to an operational creditor who merely“claims” a right to payment of a liability or obligation in respect ofa debt which may be due – In view thereof, the differentiation in thetriggering of insolvency resolution process by financial creditorsu/s. 7 and by operational creditors u/ss. 8 and 9 becomes clear –Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India (Information Utilities)Regulations, 2017 – Insolvency and Bankruptcy (Application toAdjudicating Authority) Rules, 2016 – Form I. ss. 21, 24, 28 and 30(2)(b) r/w s. 31 – Operational creditors– Right to vote in the committee of creditors – Plea that operationalcreditor do not have even a single vote in committee of creditors –Held: Financial creditors are best equipped to assess viability andfeasibility of the business of the corporate debtor and evaluate thecontents of a resolution plan – On the other hand, operationalcreditors, who provide goods and services, are involved only inrecovering amounts that are paid for such goods and services, andare typically unable to assess viability and feasibility of business –Resolution plan cannot pass muster u/s. 30(2)(b) rw s. 31 unless aminimum payment is made to operational creditors, being not lessthan liquidation value – Regulation 38 strengthens the rights ofoperational creditors by statutorily incorporating the principle offair and equitable dealing of operational creditors’ rights, togetherwith priority in payment over financial creditors – Thus, theoperational creditors are not discriminated against nor Art. 14 hasbeen infracted either on the ground of equals being treated unequallyor on the ground of manifest arbitrariness – Insolvency andBankruptcy Board of India (Insolvency Resolution Process forCorporate Persons) Regulations, 2016 – Regulation 38 –Constitution of India – Art. 14.ss.12A(as amended) and 60 – s. 12A wherein withdrawal ofapplication admitted u/ss 7, 9 or 10, with approval of ninety percent voting shares of the committee of creditors – s. 12A if violativeof Art. 14 – Held: s. 12A is not violative of Art. 14 – ILC Report hasexplained that as all financial creditors have to put their headstogether to allow such withdrawal as, ordinarily, an omnibussettlement involving all creditors ought, ideally, to be entered into –In any case, the figure of ninety per cent, in the absence of anythingfurther to show that it is arbitrary, must pertain to the domain oflegislative policy – Also, if the committee of creditors arbitrarilyrejects a just settlement and/or withdrawal claim, the NCLT, andthereafter, the NCLAT can always set aside such decision u/s. 60 –Insolvency and Bankruptcy (Second Amendment) Act, 2018 –Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India (Insolvency ResolutionProcess for Corporate Persons) Regulations, 2016 – Reg 30A.s. 210 – Private Information Utilities – Evidence providedby private information utilities – Plea that Private Information Utilities not governed by proper norms and evidence of loan defaultin records of such utility not conclusive evidence – Held: Regulations20 and 21 makes it clear that apart from the stringent requirementsas to registration of such utility, the moment information of defaultis received, such information has to be communicated to all partiesand sureties to the debt and an information utility shall expeditiouslyundertake the process of authentication and verification ofinformation – Evidence provided by private information utilities isonly prima facie evidence of default which is rebuttable by thecorporate debtor – Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India(Insolvency Resolution Process for Corporate Persons) Regulations,2016 – Regulations 20 and 21ss. 18, 41, 42 and 28 – Resolution professional – Adjudicatorypower, under the Code and the Regulations – Held: It is clear fromthe Code as well as the Regulations that the resolution professionalhas no adjudicatory powers – Resolution professional is givenadministrative as opposed to quasi-judicial powers – Even whenthe resolution professional is to make a “determination” underRegulation 35A, he is only to apply to the Adjudicating Authorityfor appropriate relief based on the determination made – Thus, theresolution professional is really a facilitator of the resolution process,whose administrative functions are overseen by the committee ofcreditors and by the Adjudicating Authority – Insolvency andBankruptcy Board of India (Insolvency Resolution Process forCorporate Persons) Regulations, 2016 – Regulations 10, 12, 13,14, and 35A.s. 29A(as amended) – Retrospective application – Submissionthat vested rights of erstwhile promoters to participate in the recoveryprocess of a corporate debtor have been impaired by retrospectiveapplication of s. 29A – Held: A statute is not retrospective merelybecause it affects existing rights or merely because a part of therequisites for its action is drawn from a time antecedent to its passing– Resolution applicant has no vested right for consideration orapproval of its resolution plan – By application of s. 29A, no vestedright is taken away – Since a resolution applicant who applies u/s.29A(c) has no vested right to apply for being considered as aresolution applicant, submission cannot be accepted. s. 29A and s.35(1)(f) proviso – s. 29A if restricted tomalfeasance – Submission that s. 29A puts a blanket ban onparticipation of all promoters of corporate debtors, without anymechanism to weed out the unscrupulous as against the efficientmanager but who have not been able to pay off their debts due toother reasons – Held: s. 29A not restricted to malfeasance –Legislative purpose which permeates s. 29A continues to permeatethe Section when it applies not merely to resolution applicants, butto liquidation also.s. 29(A)(c) – One year period in s. 29A – Non-performingasset – Plea that u/s. 29A(c), a person’s account may be classifiedas a non- performing asset even though he is not a wilful defaulter;and that the period of one year referred in clause (c) is whollyarbitrary and without any basis either in rationality or in law –Held: A person is a defaulter when an installment and/or intereston the principal remains overdue for more than three months, afterwhich, its account is declared NPA – During the period of one yearthereafter, this grace period is given to such person to pay off thedebt – If a person is unable to repay a loan taken, in whole or inpart, within this period of one year and three months, he would beineligible to become a resolution applicant – This legislative policycannot be found fault with – Neither can the period of one year befound fault with.ss. 29A(j) and 5(24A) – Related party – Plea that personswho may be relatives of erstwhile promoters are debarred frombecoming a resolution applicant – Held: Persons who act jointly orin concert with others are connected with the business activity ofthe resolution applicant – Similarly, all the categories of personsmentioned in s. 5(24A) show that such persons must be “connected”with the resolution applicant within the meaning of s. 29A(j) – Thus,the said categories of persons who are collectively mentioned underthe caption “relative” obviously need to have a connection with thebusiness activity of the resolution applicant – In the absence ofshowing that such person is “connected” with the business of theactivity of the resolution applicant, such person cannot possibly bedisqualified u/s. 29A(j) – Explanation I clause (ii) to s. 29A(j) makesit clear that if a person is otherwise covered as a “connected person”,this provision would also cover a person who is in management orcontrol of the business of the corporate debtor during the implementation of a resolution plan – Thus, any such person is notindeterminate at all, but is a person who is in the saddle of thebusiness of the corporate debtor either at an anterior point of timeor even during implementation of the resolution plan.s. 29A – Exemption of micro, small and medium enterprisesfrom s. 29A – Justification of – Held: Justified – Rationale forexcluding such industries from the eligibility criteria laid down inss.

typically unable to assess viability and feasibility of business –Resolution plan cannot pass muster u/s. 30(2)(b) rw s. 31 unless aminimum payment is made to operational creditors, being not lessthan liquidation value – Regulation 38 strengthens the rights ofoperational creditors by statutorily incorporating the principle offair and equitable dealing of operational creditors’ rights, togetherwith priority in payment over financial creditors – Thus, theoperational creditors are not discriminated against nor Art. 14 hasbeen infracted either on the ground of equals being treated unequallyor on the ground of manifest arbitrariness – Insolvency andBankruptcy Board of India (Insolvency Resolution Process forCorporate Persons) Regulations, 2016 – Regulation 38 –Constitution of India – Art. 14.ss.12A(as amended) and 60 – s. 12A wherein withdrawal ofapplication admitted u/ss 7, 9 or 10, with approval of ninety percent voting shares of the committee of creditors – s. 12A if violativeof Art. 14 – Held: s. 12A is not violative of Art. 14 – ILC Report hasexplained that as all financial creditors have to put their headstogether to allow such withdrawal as, ordinarily, an omnibussettlement involving all creditors ought, ideally, to be entered into –In any case, the figure of ninety per cent, in the absence of anythingfurther to show that it is arbitrary, must pertain to the domain oflegislative policy – Also, if the committee of creditors arbitrarilyrejects a just settlement and/or withdrawal claim, the NCLT, andthereafter, the NCLAT can always set aside such decision u/s. 60 –Insolvency and Bankruptcy (Second Amendment) Act, 2018 –Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India (Insolvency ResolutionProcess for Corporate Persons) Regulations, 2016 – Reg 30A.s. 210 – Private Information Utilities – Evidence providedby private information utilities – Plea that Private Information Utilities not governed by proper norms and evidence of loan defaultin records of such utility not conclusive evidence – Held: Regulations20 and 21 makes it clear that apart from the stringent requirementsas to registration of such utility, the moment information of defaultis received, such information has to be communicated to all partiesand sureties to the debt and an information utility shall expeditiouslyundertake the process of authentication and verification ofinformation – Evidence provided by private information utilities isonly prima facie evidence of default which is rebuttable by thecorporate debtor – Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India(Insolvency Resolution Process for Corporate Persons) Regulations,2016 – Regulations 20 and 21ss. 18, 41, 42 and 28 – Resolution professional – Adjudicatorypower, under the Code and the Regulations – Held: It is clear fromthe Code as well as the Regulations that the resolution professionalhas no adjudicatory powers – Resolution professional is givenadministrative as opposed to quasi-judicial powers – Even whenthe resolution professional is to make a “determination” underRegulation 35A, he is only to apply to the Adjudicating Authorityfor appropriate relief based on the determination made – Thus, theresolution professional is really a facilitator of the resolution process,whose administrative functions are overseen by the committee ofcreditors and by the Adjudicating Authority – Insolvency andBankruptcy Board of India (Insolvency Resolution Process forCorporate Persons) Regulations, 2016 – Regulations 10, 12, 13,14, and 35A.s. 29A(as amended) – Retrospective application – Submissionthat vested rights of erstwhile promoters to participate in the recoveryprocess of a corporate debtor have been impaired by retrospectiveapplication of s. 29A – Held: A statute is not retrospective merelybecause it affects existing rights or merely because a part of therequisites for its action is drawn from a time antecedent to its passing– Resolution applicant has no vested right for consideration orapproval of its resolution plan – By application of s. 29A, no vestedright is taken away – Since a resolution applicant who applies u/s.29A(c) has no vested right to apply for being considered as aresolution applicant, submission cannot be accepted. s. 29A and s.35(1)(f) proviso – s. 29A if restricted tomalfeasance – Submission that s. 29A puts a blanket ban onparticipation of all promoters of corporate debtors, without anymechanism to weed out the unscrupulous as against the efficientmanager but who have not been able to pay off their debts due toother reasons – Held: s. 29A not restricted to malfeasance –Legislative purpose which permeates s. 29A continues to permeatethe Section when it applies not merely to resolution applicants, butto liquidation also.s. 29(A)(c) – One year period in s. 29A – Non-performingasset – Plea that u/s. 29A(c), a person’s account may be classifiedas a non- performing asset even though he is not a wilful defaulter;and that the period of one year referred in clause (c) is whollyarbitrary and without any basis either in rationality or in law –Held: A person is a defaulter when an installment and/or intereston the principal remains overdue for more than three months, afterwhich, its account is declared NPA – During the period of one yearthereafter, this grace period is given to such person to pay off thedebt – If a person is unable to repay a loan taken, in whole or inpart, within this period of one year and three months, he would beineligible to become a resolution applicant – This legislative policycannot be found fault with – Neither can the period of one year befound fault with.ss. 29A(j) and 5(24A) – Related party – Plea that personswho may be relatives of erstwhile promoters are debarred frombecoming a resolution applicant – Held: Persons who act jointly orin concert with others are connected with the business activity ofthe resolution applicant – Similarly, all the categories of personsmentioned in s. 5(24A) show that such persons must be “connected”with the resolution applicant within the meaning of s. 29A(j) – Thus,the said categories of persons who are collectively mentioned underthe caption “relative” obviously need to have a connection with thebusiness activity of the resolution applicant – In the absence ofshowing that such person is “connected” with the business of theactivity of the resolution applicant, such person cannot possibly bedisqualified u/s. 29A(j) – Explanation I clause (ii) to s. 29A(j) makesit clear that if a person is otherwise covered as a “connected person”,this provision would also cover a person who is in management orcontrol of the business of the corporate debtor during the implementation of a resolution plan – Thus, any such person is notindeterminate at all, but is a person who is in the saddle of thebusiness of the corporate debtor either at an anterior point of timeor even during implementation of the resolution plan.s. 29A – Exemption of micro, small and medium enterprisesfrom s. 29A – Justification of – Held: Justified – Rationale forexcluding such industries from the eligibility criteria laid down inss. 29A(c) and 29A(h) is because qua such industries, otherresolution applicants may not be forthcoming, which then willinevitably lead not to resolution, but to liquidation – Micro, Smalland Medium Enterprises Development Act, 2006 – s. 7.s. 53 – Distribution of assets – Submission that in the event ofliquidation, operational creditors would never get anything as theyrank below all other creditors, including other unsecured creditorswho happen to be financial creditors, thus s. 53(1)(f) discriminatoryand arbitrary thus, violative of Art. 14 – Held: s. 53 does not violateArt. 14 – Repayment of financial debts infuses capital into theeconomy inasmuch as banks and financial institutions are able,with the money that has been paid back, to further lend such moneyto other entrepreneurs for their businesses – This rationale createsan intelligible differentia between financial debts and operationaldebts, which are unsecured, which is directly related to the objectsought to be achieved by the Code – So long as there is somelegitimate interest sought to be protected, having relation to theobject sought to be achieved by the statute, Art. 14 does not getinfracted – Constitution of India – Art. 14.Object and reasons for the Code – Explained.Enactment and working of the Code – Explained.Companies Act, 2013: s. 412 – Selection of members oftribunal and appellate tribunal – Plea that appointment of membersof the NCLT and the NCLAT contrary to Madras Bar Association(III)’s case – s. 412 whereby members of the tribunal and appellatetribunal to be selected, two judicial members of the SelectionCommittee get outweighed by three bureaucrats – Held: s. 412 hasbeen amended by the Companies Amendment Act, 2017 – Presentmembers of NCLT and NCLAT have been appointed by the SelectionCommittee, reconstituted in compliance with the direction of thisCourt. Judiciary: NCLAT Bench – Creation of Circuit Benches –Submission that NCLAT Bench has a seat only at New Delhi and iscontrary to the judgment in Madras Bar Association (II) case –Held: In view of the assurance by the Attorney General that CircuitBenches would be established soon, issuance of direction to Unionof India to set up Circuit Benches of the NCLAT within the stipulatedperiod.Constitution of India: Art. 77 – Submission that the tribunals-NCLT and NCLAT are functioning under the wrong Ministry-Ministryof Corporate Affairs, however, as per the Madras Bar Association(I)case the administrative support for all the tribunals should be fromthe Ministry of Law and Justice – Held: Rules of business beingmandatory in nature and having to be followed, are to be followedby the executive branch of the Government – However, this Court isbeing bound by the Madras Bar Association(I), the Union of Indiato follow the judgment, both in letter and spirit.",

        "HeadNote": "Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016:Constitutional validity of – Held: Provisions of the Code passesconstitutional muster.ss. 5(7), 5(8), 5(20), 7(1), 7(4), 7(5), 8 and 9 – Classificationbetween financial creditor and operational creditor – Whetherdiscriminatory, arbitrary, and violative of Art. 14 – Held: Preservingthe corporate debtor as a going concern, while ensuring maximumrecovery for all creditors being the objective of the Code, financialcreditors are clearly different from operational creditors – Thus,there is an intelligible differentia between the two which has a directrelation to the objects sought to be achieved by the Code – Thus,there is no discrimination – Constitution of India – Art. 14.ss. 3, 3(9)(c), 214(e), 60, 65, 75, 7, 8 and 9 – Notice, hearing,and set-off or counterclaim qua financial debts – Triggering ofinsolvency resolution process by financial creditors and operationalcreditors – Submission that the difference in the triggering processat behest of financial creditors and operational creditors isdiscriminatory and arbitrary – Held: A financial creditor has toprove “default” as opposed to an operational creditor who merely“claims” a right to payment of a liability or obligation in respect ofa debt which may be due – In view thereof, the differentiation in thetriggering of insolvency resolution process by financial creditorsu/s. 7 and by operational creditors u/ss. 8 and 9 becomes clear –Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India (Information Utilities)Regulations, 2017 – Insolvency and Bankruptcy (Application toAdjudicating Authority) Rules, 2016 – Form I. ss. 21, 24, 28 and 30(2)(b) r/w s. 31 – Operational creditors– Right to vote in the committee of creditors – Plea that operationalcreditor do not have even a single vote in committee of creditors –Held: Financial creditors are best equipped to assess viability andfeasibility of the business of the corporate debtor and evaluate thecontents of a resolution plan – On the other hand, operationalcreditors, who provide goods and services, are involved only inrecovering amounts that are paid for such goods and services, andare typically unable to assess viability and feasibility of business –Resolution plan cannot pass muster u/s. 30(2)(b) rw s. 31 unless aminimum payment is made to operational creditors, being not lessthan liquidation value – Regulation 38 strengthens the rights ofoperational creditors by statutorily incorporating the principle offair and equitable dealing of operational creditors’ rights, togetherwith priority in payment over financial creditors – Thus, theoperational creditors are not discriminated against nor Art. 14 hasbeen infracted either on the ground of equals being treated unequallyor on the ground of manifest arbitrariness – Insolvency andBankruptcy Board of India (Insolvency Resolution Process forCorporate Persons) Regulations, 2016 – Regulation 38 –Constitution of India – Art. 14.ss.12A(as amended) and 60 – s. 12A wherein withdrawal ofapplication admitted u/ss 7, 9 or 10, with approval of ninety percent voting shares of the committee of creditors – s. 12A if violativeof Art. 14 – Held: s. 12A is not violative of Art. 14 – ILC Report hasexplained that as all financial creditors have to put their headstogether to allow such withdrawal as, ordinarily, an omnibussettlement involving all creditors ought, ideally, to be entered into –In any case, the figure of ninety per cent, in the absence of anythingfurther to show that it is arbitrary, must pertain to the domain oflegislative policy – Also, if the committee of creditors arbitrarilyrejects a just settlement and/or withdrawal claim, the NCLT, andthereafter, the NCLAT can always set aside such decision u/s. 60 –Insolvency and Bankruptcy (Second Amendment) Act, 2018 –Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India (Insolvency ResolutionProcess for Corporate Persons) Regulations, 2016 – Reg 30A.s. 210 – Private Information Utilities – Evidence providedby private information utilities – Plea that Private Information Utilities not governed by proper norms and evidence of loan defaultin records of such utility not conclusive evidence – Held: Regulations20 and 21 makes it clear that apart from the stringent requirementsas to registration of such utility, the moment information of defaultis received, such information has to be communicated to all partiesand sureties to the debt and an information utility shall expeditiouslyundertake the process of authentication and verification ofinformation – Evidence provided by private information utilities isonly prima facie evidence of default which is rebuttable by thecorporate debtor – Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India(Insolvency Resolution Process for Corporate Persons) Regulations,2016 – Regulations 20 and 21ss. 18, 41, 42 and 28 – Resolution professional – Adjudicatorypower, under the Code and the Regulations – Held: It is clear fromthe Code as well as the Regulations that the resolution professionalhas no adjudicatory powers – Resolution professional is givenadministrative as opposed to quasi-judicial powers – Even whenthe resolution professional is to make a “determination” underRegulation 35A, he is only to apply to the Adjudicating Authorityfor appropriate relief based on the determination made – Thus, theresolution professional is really a facilitator of the resolution process,whose administrative functions are overseen by the committee ofcreditors and by the Adjudicating Authority – Insolvency andBankruptcy Board of India (Insolvency Resolution Process forCorporate Persons) Regulations, 2016 – Regulations 10, 12, 13,14, and 35A.s. 29A(as amended) – Retrospective application – Submissionthat vested rights of erstwhile promoters to participate in the recoveryprocess of a corporate debtor have been impaired by retrospectiveapplication of s. 29A – Held: A statute is not retrospective merelybecause it affects existing rights or merely because a part of therequisites for its action is drawn from a time antecedent to its passing– Resolution applicant has no vested right for consideration orapproval of its resolution plan – By application of s. 29A, no vestedright is taken away – Since a resolution applicant who applies u/s.29A(c) has no vested right to apply for being considered as aresolution applicant, submission cannot be accepted. s. 29A and s.35(1)(f) proviso – s. 29A if restricted tomalfeasance – Submission that s. 29A puts a blanket ban onparticipation of all promoters of corporate debtors, without anymechanism to weed out the unscrupulous as against the efficientmanager but who have not been able to pay off their debts due toother reasons – Held: s. 29A not restricted to malfeasance –Legislative purpose which permeates s. 29A continues to permeatethe Section when it applies not merely to resolution applicants, butto liquidation also.s. 29(A)(c) – One year period in s. 29A – Non-performingasset – Plea that u/s. 29A(c), a person’s account may be classifiedas a non- performing asset even though he is not a wilful defaulter;and that the period of one year referred in clause (c) is whollyarbitrary and without any basis either in rationality or in law –Held: A person is a defaulter when an installment and/or intereston the principal remains overdue for more than three months, afterwhich, its account is declared NPA – During the period of one yearthereafter, this grace period is given to such person to pay off thedebt – If a person is unable to repay a loan taken, in whole or inpart, within this period of one year and three months, he would beineligible to become a resolution applicant – This legislative policycannot be found fault with – Neither can the period of one year befound fault with.ss. 29A(j) and 5(24A) – Related party – Plea that personswho may be relatives of erstwhile promoters are debarred frombecoming a resolution applicant – Held: Persons who act jointly orin concert with others are connected with the business activity ofthe resolution applicant – Similarly, all the categories of personsmentioned in s. 5(24A) show that such persons must be “connected”with the resolution applicant within the meaning of s. 29A(j) – Thus,the said categories of persons who are collectively mentioned underthe caption “relative” obviously need to have a connection with thebusiness activity of the resolution applicant – In the absence ofshowing that such person is “connected” with the business of theactivity of the resolution applicant, such person cannot possibly bedisqualified u/s. 29A(j) – Explanation I clause (ii) to s. 29A(j) makesit clear that if a person is otherwise covered as a “connected person”,this provision would also cover a person who is in management orcontrol of the business of the corporate debtor during the implementation of a resolution plan – Thus, any such person is notindeterminate at all, but is a person who is in the saddle of thebusiness of the corporate debtor either at an anterior point of timeor even during implementation of the resolution plan.s. 29A – Exemption of micro, small and medium enterprisesfrom s. 29A – Justification of – Held: Justified – Rationale forexcluding such industries from the eligibility criteria laid down inss. 29A(c) and 29A(h) is because qua such industries, otherresolution applicants may not be forthcoming, which then willinevitably lead not to resolution, but to liquidation – Micro, Smalland Medium Enterprises Development Act, 2006 – s. 7.s. 53 – Distribution of assets – Submission that in the event ofliquidation, operational creditors would never get anything as theyrank below all other creditors, including other unsecured creditorswho happen to be financial creditors, thus s. 53(1)(f) discriminatoryand arbitrary thus, violative of Art. 14 – Held: s. 53 does not violateArt. 14 – Repayment of financial debts infuses capital into theeconomy inasmuch as banks and financial institutions are able,with the money that has been paid back, to further lend such moneyto other entrepreneurs for their businesses – This rationale createsan intelligible differentia between financial debts and operationaldebts, which are unsecured, which is directly related to the objectsought to be achieved by the Code – So long as there is somelegitimate interest sought to be protected, having relation to theobject sought to be achieved by the statute, Art. 14 does not getinfracted – Constitution of India – Art. 14.Object and reasons for the Code – Explained.Enactment and working of the Code – Explained.Companies Act, 2013: s. 412 – Selection of members oftribunal and appellate tribunal – Plea that appointment of membersof the NCLT and the NCLAT contrary to Madras Bar Association(III)’s case – s. 412 whereby members of the tribunal and appellatetribunal to be selected, two judicial members of the SelectionCommittee get outweighed by three bureaucrats – Held: s. 412 hasbeen amended by the Companies Amendment Act, 2017 – Presentmembers of NCLT and NCLAT have been appointed by the SelectionCommittee, reconstituted in compliance with the direction of thisCourt.
