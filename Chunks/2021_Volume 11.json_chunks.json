SARFAESI Act : ss.13(2) and (4) – Failure of Borrower to repay loan as per payment schedule – Loans declared NPA – Notice issued by Bank under s.13(2) calling upon Borrower to discharge its liability – However, Borrower neither made any payment nor responded by way of reply – Thereafter, Borrower wrote letter in which while accepting defaults and non payment enlisted reasons for not being able to adhere to payment schedule and requested to grant further moratorium – Bank granted further moratorium and deferred action under SARFAESI Act to enable Borrower to submit detailed project/viability report – Borrower failed to fulfill promise made – Post this default also there were negotiations with assurances and promises by the Borrower – Displaying forbearance, the Bank granted indulgence as action under the SARFAESI Act was deferred for nearly one year – Thereafter Bank issued notice under s.13(4) and took symbolic possession of subject property – After several attempts to auction the property, fourth attempt was successful and property was sold and sale certificate issued – Before auction, Borrower was given notice of auction – Thereafter borrower filed petition before DRT challenging the enforcement proceedings in respect of the subject property including all steps taken right from issue of notice under s.13(2) of the SARFAESI Act – DRT dismissed borrower ’s application – Borrower preferred writ petition – Meanwhile auction purchaser sold the property to second purchaser – High Court held that the Borrower can challenge the possession notice, taking of symbolic possession notice, taking of physical possession, sale notice and sale certificate as they all form part of the same cause of action – High Court concluded that compliance with s.13(3A) being mandatory, Bank had failed to respond with reasons to the representations made by the Borrower – Instant appeal filed by second purchaser – Held : It is correct that waiver being an intentional relinquishment is not to be inferred by mere failure to take action, but the instant case is of repeated positive acts post the notices under ss.13(2) and (4) of the SARFAESI Act – Not only did the Borrower not question or object to the action of the Bank, but it by express and deliberate conduct had asked the Bank to compromise its position and alter the contractual terms – The Borrower wrote repeated request letters for restructuring of loans, which prayers were considered by the Bank by giving indulgence, time and opportunities – The Borrower, aware and conscious of its rights, chose to abandon the statutory claim and took its chance and even procured favourable decisions – Borrower’s conduct had put the Bank in a position where they have lost time, and suffered on account of delay and laches, which aspects are material – Action on the subject property was delayed by more than a year as at the behest of the Borrower, the Bank gave them a long rope to regularise the account – To ignore the conduct of the Borrower would not be reasonable to the Bank once third party rights have been created – In this background, the principle of equitable estoppel as a rule of evidence bars the Borrower from complaining of violation – The Borrower challenged the actions taken by the Bank after the Subject Property had changed hands and third party interests had been created – Thus, the Borrower waived and is estopped from challenging violation of s.13(3A) of the SARFAESI Act. Judgment/Order: Remedy/relief – Grant of, scope – Held: Power of the courts/judicial authorities to mould relief – While holding that the general approach is that the claimant who succeeds in establishing the unlawfulness of administrative action is entitled to grant of remedial order, the general proposition does not undermine the discretion which the courts or judicial authorities have in assessing “what is fair and just to do in the particular case to withhold the remedy altogether or to mould the remedy by grant of a declaration rather than a more coercive quashing, prohibiting or mandatory order or injunction which may have been sought” – Relief may be granted in respect of one aspect and not others – The general approach, therefore, is that a complainant who succeeds in establishing unlawfulness of an action is entitled to a remedial order, but the court has discretion in the sense of determining what is fair and just to do in a particular case.",

        "HeadNote": "Service Law: All India Service – Appellant was candidate seeking appointment to All India Service pursuant to Civil Services Examination-2006 – She was successful and her name appeared at serial no.20 – Applicant, though an OBC candidate, came on general merit without resorting to the relaxed standard for the candidates belonging to OBC – She was allotted Himachal Pradesh Cadre after the consent of Himachal Pradesh Government – Applicant filed O.A. before CAT (Tribunal) – The grievance of the applicant was that she had a better merit than candidate-Merit No. 26 who was allocated the Maharashtra cadre as an OBC candidate and, therefore, she should have been allocated the Maharashtra cadre – Tribunal directed the Union of India to allot and accommodate the applicant against the outsider OBC vacancy in the Maharashtra Cadre by virtue of her merit over the candidate already identified and allotted the Maharashtra Cadre – The Union and the applicant aggrieved against the said order filed writ petitions before the High Court – High Court held that five admitted deficit vacancies were required to be filled up by following the outsider-insider ratio in the given cycle of 30-point roster, then there would be an insider vacancy, to be given either to the SC/ST or the OBC – Since there was no SC/ST candidate, it had to be filled up by insider OBC, i.e., the applicant – On appeal, held: High Court has completely misread the statutory rules and the policy of allocation of cadre – The Union had prescribed a procedure to be followed in the allotment of cadre to the officers of All India Services on 30.07.1984 – All the cadres/joint cadres were divided into four groups and the 24 States were arranged in alphabetical order – Later, another procedure was circulated on 30/31.05.1985 – It is the said allocation circular which was in force at the time of cadre allocation for the year 2007 – Maharashtra, Manipur-Tripura, Nagaland, Orissa, Punjab, Rajasthan and Sikkim fell in Group IIIwhereas Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu & Kashmir, Karnataka, Kerala and Madhya Pradesh fell in Group II – The applicant was allocated to the State of Himachal Pradesh and there was a consent duly given by the State of Himachal Pradesh for her allocation to that State – Therefore, mandate of r.5(1) of the Cadre Rules is satisfied when consultation was made with the State to which allocation was made – Applicant claimed allocation to the State of Kerala, i.e., her home cadre – There were 4 senior candidates in the general category – She was on merit as a general category candidate, having not availed any of the relaxed standards meant for a candidate of OBC category – In terms of proviso to r.7(3) of the Recruitment Rules and the proviso to clause 16(1) in the notification inviting applications for CSE-2006, the candidates including the applicant were put to notice, that SC/ST or OBC candidates will be treated as General Category Candidates who have not availed any concession or relaxation – Applicant was thus rightly treated as General Category candidate – In terms of Clause 16(2) of the CSE-2006 notification, the candidates belonging to the SC/ST or OBC recommended against unreserved vacancies may be adjusted against reserved vacancies by the Government, if by this process they get a service of higher choice in the order of their preference – The applicant was already allocated IAS as there was no question of change of service – Therefore, as a general category candidate, there was no occasion for consultation with State of Kerala as the applicant was not even eligible to be considered for allocation to the said State in terms of the allocation order – The reasoning given by the High Court that there was cadre deficiency, therefore, the applicant was entitled to be allocated is bereft of any merit – High Court exceeded its jurisdiction to order allocation of Kerala Cadre to the applicant without examining the policy decision of the Union to fill up only 89 vacancies – High Court again erred in law that an OBC candidate, who has not availed relaxation or concession, had to be treated as general category candidate – Candidate-Merit No.26 was the first OBC candidate who had availed concessions or relaxations as OBC and was allocated to Maharashtra cadre, being the first State in Group I in the scheme of grouping of States or cadres – Therefore, the applicant had no claim appointment to the Maharashtra cadre – She had no right to the Kerala cadre as well as the second post in the vacancies in the State of Kerala was meant for an OBC outsider candidate – SinceKerala was second last State in Group IV, the OBC candidate at Serial No. 131 was allocated such cadre – Indian Administrative Service (Cadre) Rules, 1954 – r.5(1). Service Law: All India Service – CSE-2006 – Allocation of home cadre, claimed by OBC candidate, coming on general merit without resorting to the relaxed standard for the candidates belonging to OBC – The notification inviting applications for CSE- 2006 was in terms of r.7 of the Recruitment Rules and also the allocation circular – The proviso to clause 16(1) of the notification contemplates that if an SC/ST or OBC candidate has not availed any concessions or relaxations in the eligibility or selection criteria at any stage of the examination, and if after taking into account the general qualifying standards is found fit for recommendation by the Commission, they shall not be recommended against the vacancies reserved for SC/ST and OBC – It is sub-clause (2) of Clause 16 of CSE-2006 which gives an option to SC/ST or OBC candidate recommended against unreserved vacancies to be adjusted against reserved vacancies, if by this process they get a service of higher choice in order of their preference – Thus, an SC/ST or OBC candidate selected against unreserved vacancy as a general merit candidate cannot make a grievance in respect of allocation of cadre but has a right to seek service as a reserved category candidate if that improves the selection of service – In fact, all the candidates including the applicant were put to notice as to how the cadre allocation would be made – But still, the applicant chose to claim home state though she was not eligible to be considered for such state – She had taken chance in appearing in the selection process but when she was unsuccessful in getting the home cadre, attempts were made to get into the home cadre on wholly untenable grounds – Indian Administrative Service (Recruitment) Rules, 1954 – r.7. Indian Administrative Service (Recruitment) Rules, 1954: OBC candidate, coming on general merit without resorting to the relaxed standard for the candidates belonging to OBC – Entitlement to OBC reserved seat in her State – Held: r.7(3) of the Recruitment Rules contemplates that the candidate belonging to the SC/ST or OBC found suitable by the Commission for appointment to the service “shall be appointed against unreserved vacancies” in case they qualify for appointment to the service based on their merit without recourse to the benefit of reservation – Such provision in the rule isa consonance with the judgment of this Court in Indra Sawhney and Ors. v. Union of India and Ors. – r.7(4) is to be read as a proviso to r.7(3) of the Recruitment Rules which permits the appointment of candidates of SC/ST or OBC against the vacancies reserved for such candidates “with due regard to the maintenance of efficiency of administration” – Therefore, if a SC/ST or OBC candidate who has been found suitable for appointment against the unreserved vacancies can be appointed against the vacancy reserved for SC/ ST or OBC, provided a conscious decision is taken with regard to the maintenance of efficiency of administration – The applicant though belonging to OBC has not availed any relaxations or concessions admissible to OBC candidates – She was a general merit candidate, thus not entitled to OBC reserved seat in her State – She was allocated to Himachal Pradesh cadre as a general category candidate falling in r.7(3) in view of her merit position as a general category candidate. A Service Jurisprudence: Allotment of cadre is an incidence of service – The applicant as a candidate for the All-India Service with eyes wide open has opted to serve anywhere in the country – Once an applicant gets selected to service, the scramble for the home cadre starts – The procedure for allocation of cadre is a mechanical process and admits no exception except in terms of r.7(4) which is to be read as proviso to r.7(3) – The State has no discretion of allocation of a cadre at its whims and fancies – Therefore, the Tribunal or the High Court should have refrained from interfering with the allocation of cadre on the argument of alleged violation of the allocation circular – Indian Administrative Service (Recruitment) Rules, 1954 – r.7(3) – Service law.",

        "HeadNote": "Service Law: All India Service – Appellant was candidate seeking appointment to All India Service pursuant to Civil Services Examination-2006 – She was successful and her name appeared at serial no.20 – Applicant, though an OBC candidate, came on general merit without resorting to the relaxed standard for the candidates belonging to OBC – She was allotted Himachal Pradesh Cadre after the consent of Himachal Pradesh Government – Applicant filed O.A. before CAT (Tribunal) – The grievance of the applicant was that she had a better merit than candidate-Merit No. 26 who was allocated the Maharashtra cadre as an OBC candidate and, therefore, she should have been allocated the Maharashtra cadre – Tribunal directed the Union of India to allot and accommodate the applicant against the outsider OBC vacancy in the Maharashtra Cadre by virtue of her merit over the candidate already identified and allotted the Maharashtra Cadre – The Union and the applicant aggrieved against the said order filed writ petitions before the High Court – High Court held that five admitted deficit vacancies were required to be filled up by following the outsider-insider ratio in the given cycle of 30-point roster, then there would be an insider vacancy, to be given either to the SC/ST or the OBC – Since there was no SC/ST candidate, it had to be filled up by insider OBC, i.e., the applicant – On appeal, held: High Court has completely misread the statutory rules and the policy of allocation of cadre – The Union had prescribed a procedure to be followed in the allotment of cadre to the officers of All India Services on 30.07.1984 – All the cadres/joint cadres were divided into four groups and the 24 States were arranged in alphabetical order – Later, another procedure was circulated on 30/31.05.1985 – It is the said allocation circular which was in force at the time of cadre allocation for the year 2007 – Maharashtra, Manipur-Tripura, Nagaland, Orissa, Punjab, Rajasthan and Sikkim fell in Group IIIwhereas Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu & Kashmir, Karnataka, Kerala and Madhya Pradesh fell in Group II – The applicant was allocated to the State of Himachal Pradesh and there was a consent duly given by the State of Himachal Pradesh for her allocation to that State – Therefore, mandate of r.5(1) of the Cadre Rules is satisfied when consultation was made with the State to which allocation was made – Applicant claimed allocation to the State of Kerala, i.e., her home cadre – There were 4 senior candidates in the general category – She was on merit as a general category candidate, having not availed any of the relaxed standards meant for a candidate of OBC category – In terms of proviso to r.7(3) of the Recruitment Rules and the proviso to clause 16(1) in the notification inviting applications for CSE-2006, the candidates including the applicant were put to notice, that SC/ST or OBC candidates will be treated as General Category Candidates who have not availed any concession or relaxation – Applicant was thus rightly treated as General Category candidate – In terms of Clause 16(2) of the CSE-2006 notification, the candidates belonging to the SC/ST or OBC recommended against unreserved vacancies may be adjusted against reserved vacancies by the Government, if by this process they get a service of higher choice in the order of their preference – The applicant was already allocated IAS as there was no question of change of service – Therefore, as a general category candidate, there was no occasion for consultation with State of Kerala as the applicant was not even eligible to be considered for allocation to the said State in terms of the allocation order – The reasoning given by the High Court that there was cadre deficiency, therefore, the applicant was entitled to be allocated is bereft of any merit – High Court exceeded its jurisdiction to order allocation of Kerala Cadre to the applicant without examining the policy decision of the Union to fill up only 89 vacancies – High Court again erred in law that an OBC candidate, who has not availed relaxation or concession, had to be treated as general category candidate – Candidate-Merit No.26 was the first OBC candidate who had availed concessions or relaxations as OBC and was allocated to Maharashtra cadre, being the first State in Group I in the scheme of grouping of States or cadres – Therefore, the applicant had no claim appointment to the Maharashtra cadre – She had no right to the Kerala cadre as well as the second post in the vacancies in the State of Kerala was meant for an OBC outsider candidate – SinceKerala was second last State in Group IV, the OBC candidate at Serial No. 131 was allocated such cadre – Indian Administrative Service (Cadre) Rules, 1954 – r.5(1). Service Law: All India Service – CSE-2006 – Allocation of home cadre, claimed by OBC candidate, coming on general merit without resorting to the relaxed standard for the candidates belonging to OBC – The notification inviting applications for CSE- 2006 was in terms of r.7 of the Recruitment Rules and also the allocation circular – The proviso to clause 16(1) of the notification contemplates that if an SC/ST or OBC candidate has not availed any concessions or relaxations in the eligibility or selection criteria at any stage of the examination, and if after taking into account the general qualifying standards is found fit for recommendation by the Commission, they shall not be recommended against the vacancies reserved for SC/ST and OBC – It is sub-clause (2) of Clause 16 of CSE-2006 which gives an option to SC/ST or OBC candidate recommended against unreserved vacancies to be adjusted against reserved vacancies, if by this process they get a service of higher choice in order of their preference – Thus, an SC/ST or OBC candidate selected against unreserved vacancy as a general merit candidate cannot make a grievance in respect of allocation of cadre but has a right to seek service as a reserved category candidate if that improves the selection of service – In fact, all the candidates including the applicant were put to notice as to how the cadre allocation would be made – But still, the applicant chose to claim home state though she was not eligible to be considered for such state – She had taken chance in appearing in the selection process but when she was unsuccessful in getting the home cadre, attempts were made to get into the home cadre on wholly untenable grounds – Indian Administrative Service (Recruitment) Rules, 1954 – r.7. Indian Administrative Service (Recruitment) Rules, 1954: OBC candidate, coming on general merit without resorting to the relaxed standard for the candidates belonging to OBC – Entitlement to OBC reserved seat in her State – Held: r.7(3) of the Recruitment Rules contemplates that the candidate belonging to the SC/ST or OBC found suitable by the Commission for appointment to the service “shall be appointed against unreserved vacancies” in case they qualify for appointment to the service based on their merit without recourse to the benefit of reservation – Such provision in the rule isa consonance with the judgment of this Court in Indra Sawhney and Ors. v. Union of India and Ors. – r.7(4) is to be read as a proviso to r.7(3) of the Recruitment Rules which permits the appointment of candidates of SC/ST or OBC against the vacancies reserved for such candidates “with due regard to the maintenance of efficiency of administration” – Therefore, if a SC/ST or OBC candidate who has been found suitable for appointment against the unreserved vacancies can be appointed against the vacancy reserved for SC/ ST or OBC, provided a conscious decision is taken with regard to the maintenance of efficiency of administration – The applicant though belonging to OBC has not availed any relaxations or concessions admissible to OBC candidates – She was a general merit candidate, thus not entitled to OBC reserved seat in her State – She was allocated to Himachal Pradesh cadre as a general category candidate falling in r.7(3) in view of her merit position as a general category candidate. A Service Jurisprudence: Allotment of cadre is an incidence of service – The applicant as a candidate for the All-India Service with eyes wide open has opted to serve anywhere in the country – Once an applicant gets selected to service, the scramble for the home cadre starts – The procedure for allocation of cadre is a mechanical process and admits no exception except in terms of r.7(4) which is to be read as proviso to r.7(3) – The State has no discretion of allocation of a cadre at its whims and fancies – Therefore, the Tribunal or the High Court should have refrained from interfering with the allocation of cadre on the argument of alleged violation of the allocation circular – Indian Administrative Service (Recruitment) Rules, 1954 – r.7(3) – Service law.",

Service Law: All India Service – CSE-2006 – Allocation of home cadre, claimed by OBC candidate, coming on general merit without resorting to the relaxed standard for the candidates belonging to OBC – The notification inviting applications for CSE- 2006 was in terms of r.7 of the Recruitment Rules and also the allocation circular – The proviso to clause 16(1) of the notification contemplates that if an SC/ST or OBC candidate has not availed any concessions or relaxations in the eligibility or selection criteria at any stage of the examination, and if after taking into account the general qualifying standards is found fit for recommendation by the Commission, they shall not be recommended against the vacancies reserved for SC/ST and OBC – It is sub-clause (2) of Clause 16 of CSE-2006 which gives an option to SC/ST or OBC candidate recommended against unreserved vacancies to be adjusted against reserved vacancies, if by this process they get a service of higher choice in order of their preference – Thus, an SC/ST or OBC candidate selected against unreserved vacancy as a general merit candidate cannot make a grievance in respect of allocation of cadre but has a right to seek service as a reserved category candidate if that improves the selection of service – In fact, all the candidates including the applicant were put to notice as to how the cadre allocation would be made – But still, the applicant chose to claim home state though she was not eligible to be considered for such state – She had taken chance in appearing in the selection process but when she was unsuccessful in getting the home cadre, attempts were made to get into the home cadre on wholly untenable grounds – Indian Administrative Service (Recruitment) Rules, 1954 – r.7. Indian Administrative Service (Recruitment) Rules, 1954: OBC candidate, coming on general merit without resorting to the relaxed standard for the candidates belonging to OBC – Entitlement to OBC reserved seat in her State – Held: r.7(3) of the Recruitment Rules contemplates that the candidate belonging to the SC/ST or OBC found suitable by the Commission for appointment to the service “shall be appointed against unreserved vacancies” in case they qualify for appointment to the service based on their merit without recourse to the benefit of reservation – Such provision in the rule isa consonance with the judgment of this Court in Indra Sawhney and Ors. v. Union of India and Ors. – r.7(4) is to be read as a proviso to r.7(3) of the Recruitment Rules which permits the appointment of candidates of SC/ST or OBC against the vacancies reserved for such candidates “with due regard to the maintenance of efficiency of administration” – Therefore, if a SC/ST or OBC candidate who has been found suitable for appointment against the unreserved vacancies can be appointed against the vacancy reserved for SC/ ST or OBC, provided a conscious decision is taken with regard to the maintenance of efficiency of administration – The applicant though belonging to OBC has not availed any relaxations or concessions admissible to OBC candidates – She was a general merit candidate, thus not entitled to OBC reserved seat in her State – She was allocated to Himachal Pradesh cadre as a general category candidate falling in r.7(3) in view of her merit position as a general category candidate. A Service Jurisprudence: Allotment of cadre is an incidence of service – The applicant as a candidate for the All-India Service with eyes wide open has opted to serve anywhere in the country – Once an applicant gets selected to service, the scramble for the home cadre starts – The procedure for allocation of cadre is a mechanical process and admits no exception except in terms of r.7(4) which is to be read as proviso to r.7(3) – The State has no discretion of allocation of a cadre at its whims and fancies – Therefore, the Tribunal or the High Court should have refrained from interfering with the allocation of cadre on the argument of alleged violation of the allocation circular – Indian Administrative Service (Recruitment) Rules, 1954 – r.7(3) – Service law.",

Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 – s. 193 – Mines and Mineral (Development and Regulation) Act, 1957 – Karnataka Forest Rules, 1969 – Cognizance of the offence and not the offender – The Special Judge by an order mentions that cognizance is taken against the accused – Whether merely because the cognizance order mentions that cognizance is taken against the ‘accused’, the entire proceedings would be vitiated – Held : It is a settled principle of law that cognizance is taken of the offence and not the offender – However, the cognizance order indicates that the Special Judge has perused all the relevant material relating to the case before cognizance was taken – The change in the form of the order would not alter its effect – The order taking cognizance inadvertently mentioned that the Special Judge has taken cognizance against the accused instead of the offence – This would not vitiate the entire proceedings. Mines and Mineral (Development and Regulation) Act, 1957 – Karnataka Forest Rules, 1969 – Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 – ss. 193, 220 – Penal Code, 1860 – Cognizance by the Special Court of the offences under IPC – It was contended that even if the Special Judge had the power to take cognizance of the offence, he could only have taken cognizance of offences under the MMDR Act and could not have taken cognizance (and conduct trial) of the offences under the provisions of IPC – Held : Since offences under IPC are alleged to have been committed in the course of the same transaction as the offences under the MMDR Act, the situation is squarely covered by sub-section (1) of s.220 of CrPC – The Special Court has the power to take cognizance of offences under MMDR Act and conduct a joint trial with other offences if permissible u/s. 220 CrPC – There is no express provision in the MMDR Act which indicates that s.220 CrPC does not apply to proceedings under the MMDR Act. Mines and Mineral (Development and Regulation) Act, 1957 – Karnataka Forest Rules, 1969 – Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 – s. 193 – Cognizance order and non-application of mind – Allegations of purchasing and selling extracted iron ore illegally without mining dispatch permits and the payments of charges to the Mining and Geological Departments and the Forest Department – FIR registered and a final report u/s. 173 of Cr.P.C. submitted – Additional City and Civil Sessions Judge and Special Judge took cognizance after perusing the final report – It was contended that the order of the Special Judge taking cognizance has not sufficiently demonstrated application of mind to the material placed before him – Held : The Special Judge, took cognizance on the basis of a report submitted u/s. 173 CrPC and not on the basis of a private complaint – The Special Judge took note of the FIR, the witness statements, and connected documents before taking cognizance of the offence – In this backdrop, it would be far-fetched to fault the order of the Special Judge on the ground that it does not adduce detailed reasons for taking cognizance or that it does not indicate that an application of mind. Mines and Mineral (Development and Regulation) Act, 1957 – s.22 – Karnataka Forest Rules, 1969 – Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 – Allegations of purchasing and selling extracted iron ore illegally without mining dispatch permits and the payments of charges to the Mining and Geological Departments and the Forest Department – FIR registered and a final report u/s. 173 of Cr.P.C. submitted – Additional City and Civil Sessions Judge and Special Judge took cognizance after perusing the final report – Appellant contended that before the Special Court (Sessions Court) took cognizance of the offence, no complaint was filed by the authorised person – Held : A combined reading of the notifications dated 29 May 2014 and 21 January 2014 indicate that the Sub-Inspector of Lokayukta is an authorized person for the purpose of s.22 of the MMDR Act – The FIR that was filed to overcome the bar u/s. 22 has been signed by the Sub-Inspector of Lokayukta Police and the information was given by the SIT – Therefore, the respondent had complied with s.22 MMDR Act. Procedure, 1973 – Vicarious liability – Allegations of purchasing and selling extracted iron ore illegally without mining dispatch permits and the payments of charges to the Mining and Geological Departments and the Forest Department – FIR registered and a final report u/s. 173 of Cr.P.C. submitted – Additional City and Civil Sessions Judge and Special Judge took cognizance after perusing the final report – It was contended that the charge- sheet does not ascribe any role to A-1 and hence the process initiated against him must be quashed – Held : The determination of whether the conditions stipulated in s.23 of the MMDR Act have been fulfilled is a matter of trial – Moreover, it is evident that the charge sheet, as a matter of fact, ascribes a role to A-1 and A-2 for the payment of transportation – Therefore, there is a prima facie case against A-1, which is sufficient to arraign him as an accused at this stage.",

Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 – s. 193 – Mines and Mineral (Development and Regulation) Act, 1957 – Karnataka Forest Rules, 1969 – Cognizance of the offence and not the offender – The Special Judge by an order mentions that cognizance is taken against the accused – Whether merely because the cognizance order mentions that cognizance is taken against the ‘accused’, the entire proceedings would be vitiated – Held : It is a settled principle of law that cognizance is taken of the offence and not the offender – However, the cognizance order indicates that the Special Judge has perused all the relevant material relating to the case before cognizance was taken – The change in the form of the order would not alter its effect – The order taking cognizance inadvertently mentioned that the Special Judge has taken cognizance against the accused instead of the offence – This would not vitiate the entire proceedings. Mines and Mineral (Development and Regulation) Act, 1957 – Karnataka Forest Rules, 1969 – Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 – ss. 193, 220 – Penal Code, 1860 – Cognizance by the Special Court of the offences under IPC – It was contended that even if the Special Judge had the power to take cognizance of the offence, he could only have taken cognizance of offences under the MMDR Act and could not have taken cognizance (and conduct trial) of the offences under the provisions of IPC – Held : Since offences under IPC are alleged to have been committed in the course of the same transaction as the offences under the MMDR Act, the situation is squarely covered by sub-section (1) of s.220 of CrPC – The Special Court has the power to take cognizance of offences under MMDR Act and conduct a joint trial with other offences if permissible u/s. 220 CrPC – There is no express provision in the MMDR Act which indicates that s.220 CrPC does not apply to proceedings under the MMDR Act. Mines and Mineral (Development and Regulation) Act, 1957 – Karnataka Forest Rules, 1969 – Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 – s. 193 – Cognizance order and non-application of mind – Allegations of purchasing and selling extracted iron ore illegally without mining dispatch permits and the payments of charges to the Mining and Geological Departments and the Forest Department – FIR registered and a final report u/s. 173 of Cr.P.C. submitted – Additional City and Civil Sessions Judge and Special Judge took cognizance after perusing the final report – It was contended that the order of the Special Judge taking cognizance has not sufficiently demonstrated application of mind to the material placed before him – Held : The Special Judge, took cognizance on the basis of a report submitted u/s. 173 CrPC and not on the basis of a private complaint – The Special Judge took note of the FIR, the witness statements, and connected documents before taking cognizance of the offence – In this backdrop, it would be far-fetched to fault the order of the Special Judge on the ground that it does not adduce detailed reasons for taking cognizance or that it does not indicate that an application of mind. Mines and Mineral (Development and Regulation) Act, 1957 – s.22 – Karnataka Forest Rules, 1969 – Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 – Allegations of purchasing and selling extracted iron ore illegally without mining dispatch permits and the payments of charges to the Mining and Geological Departments and the Forest Department – FIR registered and a final report u/s. 173 of Cr.P.C. submitted – Additional City and Civil Sessions Judge and Special Judge took cognizance after perusing the final report – Appellant contended that before the Special Court (Sessions Court) took cognizance of the offence, no complaint was filed by the authorised person – Held : A combined reading of the notifications dated 29 May 2014 and 21 January 2014 indicate that the Sub-Inspector of Lokayukta is an authorized person for the purpose of s.22 of the MMDR Act – The FIR that was filed to overcome the bar u/s. 22 has been signed by the Sub-Inspector of Lokayukta Police and the information was given by the SIT – Therefore, the respondent had complied with s.22 MMDR Act. Procedure, 1973 – Vicarious liability – Allegations of purchasing and selling extracted iron ore illegally without mining dispatch permits and the payments of charges to the Mining and Geological Departments and the Forest Department – FIR registered and a final report u/s. 173 of Cr.P.C. submitted – Additional City and Civil Sessions Judge and Special Judge took cognizance after perusing the final report – It was contended that the charge- sheet does not ascribe any role to A-1 and hence the process initiated against him must be quashed – Held : The determination of whether the conditions stipulated in s.23 of the MMDR Act have been fulfilled is a matter of trial – Moreover, it is evident that the charge sheet, as a matter of fact, ascribes a role to A-1 and A-2 for the payment of transportation – Therefore, there is a prima facie case against A-1, which is sufficient to arraign him as an accused at this stage.",

Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 – s. 193 – Mines and Mineral (Development and Regulation) Act, 1957 – Karnataka Forest Rules, 1969 – Cognizance of the offence and not the offender – The Special Judge by an order mentions that cognizance is taken against the accused – Whether merely because the cognizance order mentions that cognizance is taken against the ‘accused’, the entire proceedings would be vitiated – Held : It is a settled principle of law that cognizance is taken of the offence and not the offender – However, the cognizance order indicates that the Special Judge has perused all the relevant material relating to the case before cognizance was taken – The change in the form of the order would not alter its effect – The order taking cognizance inadvertently mentioned that the Special Judge has taken cognizance against the accused instead of the offence – This would not vitiate the entire proceedings. Mines and Mineral (Development and Regulation) Act, 1957 – Karnataka Forest Rules, 1969 – Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 – ss. 193, 220 – Penal Code, 1860 – Cognizance by the Special Court of the offences under IPC – It was contended that even if the Special Judge had the power to take cognizance of the offence, he could only have taken cognizance of offences under the MMDR Act and could not have taken cognizance (and conduct trial) of the offences under the provisions of IPC – Held : Since offences under IPC are alleged to have been committed in the course of the same transaction as the offences under the MMDR Act, the situation is squarely covered by sub-section (1) of s.220 of CrPC – The Special Court has the power to take cognizance of offences under MMDR Act and conduct a joint trial with other offences if permissible u/s. 220 CrPC – There is no express provision in the MMDR Act which indicates that s.220 CrPC does not apply to proceedings under the MMDR Act. Mines and Mineral (Development and Regulation) Act, 1957 – Karnataka Forest Rules, 1969 – Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 – s. 193 – Cognizance order and non-application of mind – Allegations of purchasing and selling extracted iron ore illegally without mining dispatch permits and the payments of charges to the Mining and Geological Departments and the Forest Department – FIR registered and a final report u/s. 173 of Cr.P.C. submitted – Additional City and Civil Sessions Judge and Special Judge took cognizance after perusing the final report – It was contended that the order of the Special Judge taking cognizance has not sufficiently demonstrated application of mind to the material placed before him – Held : The Special Judge, took cognizance on the basis of a report submitted u/s. 173 CrPC and not on the basis of a private complaint – The Special Judge took note of the FIR, the witness statements, and connected documents before taking cognizance of the offence – In this backdrop, it would be far-fetched to fault the order of the Special Judge on the ground that it does not adduce detailed reasons for taking cognizance or that it does not indicate that an application of mind. Mines and Mineral (Development and Regulation) Act, 1957 – s.22 – Karnataka Forest Rules, 1969 – Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 – Allegations of purchasing and selling extracted iron ore illegally without mining dispatch permits and the payments of charges to the Mining and Geological Departments and the Forest Department – FIR registered and a final report u/s. 173 of Cr.P.C. submitted – Additional City and Civil Sessions Judge and Special Judge took cognizance after perusing the final report – Appellant contended that before the Special Court (Sessions Court) took cognizance of the offence, no complaint was filed by the authorised person – Held : A combined reading of the notifications dated 29 May 2014 and 21 January 2014 indicate that the Sub-Inspector of Lokayukta is an authorized person for the purpose of s.22 of the MMDR Act – The FIR that was filed to overcome the bar u/s. 22 has been signed by the Sub-Inspector of Lokayukta Police and the information was given by the SIT – Therefore, the respondent had complied with s.22 MMDR Act. Procedure, 1973 – Vicarious liability – Allegations of purchasing and selling extracted iron ore illegally without mining dispatch permits and the payments of charges to the Mining and Geological Departments and the Forest Department – FIR registered and a final report u/s. 173 of Cr.P.C. submitted – Additional City and Civil Sessions Judge and Special Judge took cognizance after perusing the final report – It was contended that the charge- sheet does not ascribe any role to A-1 and hence the process initiated against him must be quashed – Held : The determination of whether the conditions stipulated in s.23 of the MMDR Act have been fulfilled is a matter of trial – Moreover, it is evident that the charge sheet, as a matter of fact, ascribes a role to A-1 and A-2 for the payment of transportation – Therefore, there is a prima facie case against A-1, which is sufficient to arraign him as an accused at this stage.",

Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 – s. 193 – Mines and Mineral (Development and Regulation) Act, 1957 – Karnataka Forest Rules, 1969 – Cognizance of the offence and not the offender – The Special Judge by an order mentions that cognizance is taken against the accused – Whether merely because the cognizance order mentions that cognizance is taken against the ‘accused’, the entire proceedings would be vitiated – Held : It is a settled principle of law that cognizance is taken of the offence and not the offender – However, the cognizance order indicates that the Special Judge has perused all the relevant material relating to the case before cognizance was taken – The change in the form of the order would not alter its effect – The order taking cognizance inadvertently mentioned that the Special Judge has taken cognizance against the accused instead of the offence – This would not vitiate the entire proceedings. Mines and Mineral (Development and Regulation) Act, 1957 – Karnataka Forest Rules, 1969 – Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 – ss. 193, 220 – Penal Code, 1860 – Cognizance by the Special Court of the offences under IPC – It was contended that even if the Special Judge had the power to take cognizance of the offence, he could only have taken cognizance of offences under the MMDR Act and could not have taken cognizance (and conduct trial) of the offences under the provisions of IPC – Held : Since offences under IPC are alleged to have been committed in the course of the same transaction as the offences under the MMDR Act, the situation is squarely covered by sub-section (1) of s.220 of CrPC – The Special Court has the power to take cognizance of offences under MMDR Act and conduct a joint trial with other offences if permissible u/s. 220 CrPC – There is no express provision in the MMDR Act which indicates that s.220 CrPC does not apply to proceedings under the MMDR Act. Mines and Mineral (Development and Regulation) Act, 1957 – Karnataka Forest Rules, 1969 – Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 – s. 193 – Cognizance order and non-application of mind – Allegations of purchasing and selling extracted iron ore illegally without mining dispatch permits and the payments of charges to the Mining and Geological Departments and the Forest Department – FIR registered and a final report u/s. 173 of Cr.P.C. submitted – Additional City and Civil Sessions Judge and Special Judge took cognizance after perusing the final report – It was contended that the order of the Special Judge taking cognizance has not sufficiently demonstrated application of mind to the material placed before him – Held : The Special Judge, took cognizance on the basis of a report submitted u/s. 173 CrPC and not on the basis of a private complaint – The Special Judge took note of the FIR, the witness statements, and connected documents before taking cognizance of the offence – In this backdrop, it would be far-fetched to fault the order of the Special Judge on the ground that it does not adduce detailed reasons for taking cognizance or that it does not indicate that an application of mind. Mines and Mineral (Development and Regulation) Act, 1957 – s.22 – Karnataka Forest Rules, 1969 – Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 – Allegations of purchasing and selling extracted iron ore illegally without mining dispatch permits and the payments of charges to the Mining and Geological Departments and the Forest Department – FIR registered and a final report u/s. 173 of Cr.P.C. submitted – Additional City and Civil Sessions Judge and Special Judge took cognizance after perusing the final report – Appellant contended that before the Special Court (Sessions Court) took cognizance of the offence, no complaint was filed by the authorised person – Held : A combined reading of the notifications dated 29 May 2014 and 21 January 2014 indicate that the Sub-Inspector of Lokayukta is an authorized person for the purpose of s.22 of the MMDR Act – The FIR that was filed to overcome the bar u/s. 22 has been signed by the Sub-Inspector of Lokayukta Police and the information was given by the SIT – Therefore, the respondent had complied with s.22 MMDR Act. Procedure, 1973 – Vicarious liability – Allegations of purchasing and selling extracted iron ore illegally without mining dispatch permits and the payments of charges to the Mining and Geological Departments and the Forest Department – FIR registered and a final report u/s. 173 of Cr.P.C. submitted – Additional City and Civil Sessions Judge and Special Judge took cognizance after perusing the final report – It was contended that the charge- sheet does not ascribe any role to A-1 and hence the process initiated against him must be quashed – Held : The determination of whether the conditions stipulated in s.23 of the MMDR Act have been fulfilled is a matter of trial – Moreover, it is evident that the charge sheet, as a matter of fact, ascribes a role to A-1 and A-2 for the payment of transportation – Therefore, there is a prima facie case against A-1, which is sufficient to arraign him as an accused at this stage.",

Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 – s. 193 – Mines and Mineral (Development and Regulation) Act, 1957 – Karnataka Forest Rules, 1969 – Cognizance of the offence and not the offender – The Special Judge by an order mentions that cognizance is taken against the accused – Whether merely because the cognizance order mentions that cognizance is taken against the ‘accused’, the entire proceedings would be vitiated – Held : It is a settled principle of law that cognizance is taken of the offence and not the offender – However, the cognizance order indicates that the Special Judge has perused all the relevant material relating to the case before cognizance was taken – The change in the form of the order would not alter its effect – The order taking cognizance inadvertently mentioned that the Special Judge has taken cognizance against the accused instead of the offence – This would not vitiate the entire proceedings. Mines and Mineral (Development and Regulation) Act, 1957 – Karnataka Forest Rules, 1969 – Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 – ss. 193, 220 – Penal Code, 1860 – Cognizance by the Special Court of the offences under IPC – It was contended that even if the Special Judge had the power to take cognizance of the offence, he could only have taken cognizance of offences under the MMDR Act and could not have taken cognizance (and conduct trial) of the offences under the provisions of IPC – Held : Since offences under IPC are alleged to have been committed in the course of the same transaction as the offences under the MMDR Act, the situation is squarely covered by sub-section (1) of s.220 of CrPC – The Special Court has the power to take cognizance of offences under MMDR Act and conduct a joint trial with other offences if permissible u/s. 220 CrPC – There is no express provision in the MMDR Act which indicates that s.220 CrPC does not apply to proceedings under the MMDR Act. Mines and Mineral (Development and Regulation) Act, 1957 – Karnataka Forest Rules, 1969 – Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 – s. 193 – Cognizance order and non-application of mind – Allegations of purchasing and selling extracted iron ore illegally without mining dispatch permits and the payments of charges to the Mining and Geological Departments and the Forest Department – FIR registered and a final report u/s. 173 of Cr.P.C. submitted – Additional City and Civil Sessions Judge and Special Judge took cognizance after perusing the final report – It was contended that the order of the Special Judge taking cognizance has not sufficiently demonstrated application of mind to the material placed before him – Held : The Special Judge, took cognizance on the basis of a report submitted u/s. 173 CrPC and not on the basis of a private complaint – The Special Judge took note of the FIR, the witness statements, and connected documents before taking cognizance of the offence – In this backdrop, it would be far-fetched to fault the order of the Special Judge on the ground that it does not adduce detailed reasons for taking cognizance or that it does not indicate that an application of mind. Mines and Mineral (Development and Regulation) Act, 1957 – s.22 – Karnataka Forest Rules, 1969 – Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 – Allegations of purchasing and selling extracted iron ore illegally without mining dispatch permits and the payments of charges to the Mining and Geological Departments and the Forest Department – FIR registered and a final report u/s. 173 of Cr.P.C. submitted – Additional City and Civil Sessions Judge and Special Judge took cognizance after perusing the final report – Appellant contended that before the Special Court (Sessions Court) took cognizance of the offence, no complaint was filed by the authorised person – Held : A combined reading of the notifications dated 29 May 2014 and 21 January 2014 indicate that the Sub-Inspector of Lokayukta is an authorized person for the purpose of s.22 of the MMDR Act – The FIR that was filed to overcome the bar u/s. 22 has been signed by the Sub-Inspector of Lokayukta Police and the information was given by the SIT – Therefore, the respondent had complied with s.22 MMDR Act. Procedure, 1973 – Vicarious liability – Allegations of purchasing and selling extracted iron ore illegally without mining dispatch permits and the payments of charges to the Mining and Geological Departments and the Forest Department – FIR registered and a final report u/s. 173 of Cr.P.C. submitted – Additional City and Civil Sessions Judge and Special Judge took cognizance after perusing the final report – It was contended that the charge- sheet does not ascribe any role to A-1 and hence the process initiated against him must be quashed – Held : The determination of whether the conditions stipulated in s.23 of the MMDR Act have been fulfilled is a matter of trial – Moreover, it is evident that the charge sheet, as a matter of fact, ascribes a role to A-1 and A-2 for the payment of transportation – Therefore, there is a prima facie case against A-1, which is sufficient to arraign him as an accused at this stage.",

Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 – s. 193 – Mines and Mineral (Development and Regulation) Act, 1957 – Karnataka Forest Rules, 1969 – Cognizance of the offence and not the offender – The Special Judge by an order mentions that cognizance is taken against the accused – Whether merely because the cognizance order mentions that cognizance is taken against the ‘accused’, the entire proceedings would be vitiated – Held : It is a settled principle of law that cognizance is taken of the offence and not the offender – However, the cognizance order indicates that the Special Judge has perused all the relevant material relating to the case before cognizance was taken – The change in the form of the order would not alter its effect – The order taking cognizance inadvertently mentioned that the Special Judge has taken cognizance against the accused instead of the offence – This would not vitiate the entire proceedings. Mines and Mineral (Development and Regulation) Act, 1957 – Karnataka Forest Rules, 1969 – Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 – ss. 193, 220 – Penal Code, 1860 – Cognizance by the Special Court of the offences under IPC – It was contended that even if the Special Judge had the power to take cognizance of the offence, he could only have taken cognizance of offences under the MMDR Act and could not have taken cognizance (and conduct trial) of the offences under the provisions of IPC – Held : Since offences under IPC are alleged to have been committed in the course of the same transaction as the offences under the MMDR Act, the situation is squarely covered by sub-section (1) of s.220 of CrPC – The Special Court has the power to take cognizance of offences under MMDR Act and conduct a joint trial with other offences if permissible u/s. 220 CrPC – There is no express provision in the MMDR Act which indicates that s.220 CrPC does not apply to proceedings under the MMDR Act. Mines and Mineral (Development and Regulation) Act, 1957 – Karnataka Forest Rules, 1969 – Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 – s. 193 – Cognizance order and non-application of mind – Allegations of purchasing and selling extracted iron ore illegally without mining dispatch permits and the payments of charges to the Mining and Geological Departments and the Forest Department – FIR registered and a final report u/s. 173 of Cr.P.C. submitted – Additional City and Civil Sessions Judge and Special Judge took cognizance after perusing the final report – It was contended that the order of the Special Judge taking cognizance has not sufficiently demonstrated application of mind to the material placed before him – Held : The Special Judge, took cognizance on the basis of a report submitted u/s. 173 CrPC and not on the basis of a private complaint – The Special Judge took note of the FIR, the witness statements, and connected documents before taking cognizance of the offence – In this backdrop, it would be far-fetched to fault the order of the Special Judge on the ground that it does not adduce detailed reasons for taking cognizance or that it does not indicate that an application of mind. Mines and Mineral (Development and Regulation) Act, 1957 – s.22 – Karnataka Forest Rules, 1969 – Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 – Allegations of purchasing and selling extracted iron ore illegally without mining dispatch permits and the payments of charges to the Mining and Geological Departments and the Forest Department – FIR registered and a final report u/s. 173 of Cr.P.C. submitted – Additional City and Civil Sessions Judge and Special Judge took cognizance after perusing the final report – Appellant contended that before the Special Court (Sessions Court) took cognizance of the offence, no complaint was filed by the authorised person – Held : A combined reading of the notifications dated 29 May 2014 and 21 January 2014 indicate that the Sub-Inspector of Lokayukta is an authorized person for the purpose of s.22 of the MMDR Act – The FIR that was filed to overcome the bar u/s. 22 has been signed by the Sub-Inspector of Lokayukta Police and the information was given by the SIT – Therefore, the respondent had complied with s.22 MMDR Act. Procedure, 1973 – Vicarious liability – Allegations of purchasing and selling extracted iron ore illegally without mining dispatch permits and the payments of charges to the Mining and Geological Departments and the Forest Department – FIR registered and a final report u/s. 173 of Cr.P.C. submitted – Additional City and Civil Sessions Judge and Special Judge took cognizance after perusing the final report – It was contended that the charge- sheet does not ascribe any role to A-1 and hence the process initiated against him must be quashed – Held : The determination of whether the conditions stipulated in s.23 of the MMDR Act have been fulfilled is a matter of trial – Moreover, it is evident that the charge sheet, as a matter of fact, ascribes a role to A-1 and A-2 for the payment of transportation – Therefore, there is a prima facie case against A-1, which is sufficient to arraign him as an accused at this stage.",

Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 – s. 193 – Mines and Mineral (Development and Regulation) Act, 1957 – Karnataka Forest Rules, 1969 – Cognizance of the offence and not the offender – The Special Judge by an order mentions that cognizance is taken against the accused – Whether merely because the cognizance order mentions that cognizance is taken against the ‘accused’, the entire proceedings would be vitiated – Held : It is a settled principle of law that cognizance is taken of the offence and not the offender – However, the cognizance order indicates that the Special Judge has perused all the relevant material relating to the case before cognizance was taken – The change in the form of the order would not alter its effect – The order taking cognizance inadvertently mentioned that the Special Judge has taken cognizance against the accused instead of the offence – This would not vitiate the entire proceedings. Mines and Mineral (Development and Regulation) Act, 1957 – Karnataka Forest Rules, 1969 – Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 – ss. 193, 220 – Penal Code, 1860 – Cognizance by the Special Court of the offences under IPC – It was contended that even if the Special Judge had the power to take cognizance of the offence, he could only have taken cognizance of offences under the MMDR Act and could not have taken cognizance (and conduct trial) of the offences under the provisions of IPC – Held : Since offences under IPC are alleged to have been committed in the course of the same transaction as the offences under the MMDR Act, the situation is squarely covered by sub-section (1) of s.220 of CrPC – The Special Court has the power to take cognizance of offences under MMDR Act and conduct a joint trial with other offences if permissible u/s. 220 CrPC – There is no express provision in the MMDR Act which indicates that s.220 CrPC does not apply to proceedings under the MMDR Act. Mines and Mineral (Development and Regulation) Act, 1957 – Karnataka Forest Rules, 1969 – Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 – s. 193 – Cognizance order and non-application of mind – Allegations of purchasing and selling extracted iron ore illegally without mining dispatch permits and the payments of charges to the Mining and Geological Departments and the Forest Department – FIR registered and a final report u/s. 173 of Cr.P.C. submitted – Additional City and Civil Sessions Judge and Special Judge took cognizance after perusing the final report – It was contended that the order of the Special Judge taking cognizance has not sufficiently demonstrated application of mind to the material placed before him – Held : The Special Judge, took cognizance on the basis of a report submitted u/s. 173 CrPC and not on the basis of a private complaint – The Special Judge took note of the FIR, the witness statements, and connected documents before taking cognizance of the offence – In this backdrop, it would be far-fetched to fault the order of the Special Judge on the ground that it does not adduce detailed reasons for taking cognizance or that it does not indicate that an application of mind. Mines and Mineral (Development and Regulation) Act, 1957 – s.22 – Karnataka Forest Rules, 1969 – Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 – Allegations of purchasing and selling extracted iron ore illegally without mining dispatch permits and the payments of charges to the Mining and Geological Departments and the Forest Department – FIR registered and a final report u/s. 173 of Cr.P.C. submitted – Additional City and Civil Sessions Judge and Special Judge took cognizance after perusing the final report – Appellant contended that before the Special Court (Sessions Court) took cognizance of the offence, no complaint was filed by the authorised person – Held : A combined reading of the notifications dated 29 May 2014 and 21 January 2014 indicate that the Sub-Inspector of Lokayukta is an authorized person for the purpose of s.22 of the MMDR Act – The FIR that was filed to overcome the bar u/s. 22 has been signed by the Sub-Inspector of Lokayukta Police and the information was given by the SIT – Therefore, the respondent had complied with s.22 MMDR Act. Procedure, 1973 – Vicarious liability – Allegations of purchasing and selling extracted iron ore illegally without mining dispatch permits and the payments of charges to the Mining and Geological Departments and the Forest Department – FIR registered and a final report u/s. 173 of Cr.P.C. submitted – Additional City and Civil Sessions Judge and Special Judge took cognizance after perusing the final report – It was contended that the charge- sheet does not ascribe any role to A-1 and hence the process initiated against him must be quashed – Held : The determination of whether the conditions stipulated in s.23 of the MMDR Act have been fulfilled is a matter of trial – Moreover, it is evident that the charge sheet, as a matter of fact, ascribes a role to A-1 and A-2 for the payment of transportation – Therefore, there is a prima facie case against A-1, which is sufficient to arraign him as an accused at this stage.",

Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 – s. 193 – Mines and Mineral (Development and Regulation) Act, 1957 – Karnataka Forest Rules, 1969 – Cognizance of the offence and not the offender – The Special Judge by an order mentions that cognizance is taken against the accused – Whether merely because the cognizance order mentions that cognizance is taken against the ‘accused’, the entire proceedings would be vitiated – Held : It is a settled principle of law that cognizance is taken of the offence and not the offender – However, the cognizance order indicates that the Special Judge has perused all the relevant material relating to the case before cognizance was taken – The change in the form of the order would not alter its effect – The order taking cognizance inadvertently mentioned that the Special Judge has taken cognizance against the accused instead of the offence – This would not vitiate the entire proceedings. Mines and Mineral (Development and Regulation) Act, 1957 – Karnataka Forest Rules, 1969 – Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 – ss. 193, 220 – Penal Code, 1860 – Cognizance by the Special Court of the offences under IPC – It was contended that even if the Special Judge had the power to take cognizance of the offence, he could only have taken cognizance of offences under the MMDR Act and could not have taken cognizance (and conduct trial) of the offences under the provisions of IPC – Held : Since offences under IPC are alleged to have been committed in the course of the same transaction as the offences under the MMDR Act, the situation is squarely covered by sub-section (1) of s.220 of CrPC – The Special Court has the power to take cognizance of offences under MMDR Act and conduct a joint trial with other offences if permissible u/s. 220 CrPC – There is no express provision in the MMDR Act which indicates that s.220 CrPC does not apply to proceedings under the MMDR Act. Mines and Mineral (Development and Regulation) Act, 1957 – Karnataka Forest Rules, 1969 – Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 – s. 193 – Cognizance order and non-application of mind – Allegations of purchasing and selling extracted iron ore illegally without mining dispatch permits and the payments of charges to the Mining and Geological Departments and the Forest Department – FIR registered and a final report u/s. 173 of Cr.P.C. submitted – Additional City and Civil Sessions Judge and Special Judge took cognizance after perusing the final report – It was contended that the order of the Special Judge taking cognizance has not sufficiently demonstrated application of mind to the material placed before him – Held : The Special Judge, took cognizance on the basis of a report submitted u/s. 173 CrPC and not on the basis of a private complaint – The Special Judge took note of the FIR, the witness statements, and connected documents before taking cognizance of the offence – In this backdrop, it would be far-fetched to fault the order of the Special Judge on the ground that it does not adduce detailed reasons for taking cognizance or that it does not indicate that an application of mind. Mines and Mineral (Development and Regulation) Act, 1957 – s.22 – Karnataka Forest Rules, 1969 – Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 – Allegations of purchasing and selling extracted iron ore illegally without mining dispatch permits and the payments of charges to the Mining and Geological Departments and the Forest Department – FIR registered and a final report u/s. 173 of Cr.P.C. submitted – Additional City and Civil Sessions Judge and Special Judge took cognizance after perusing the final report – Appellant contended that before the Special Court (Sessions Court) took cognizance of the offence, no complaint was filed by the authorised person – Held : A combined reading of the notifications dated 29 May 2014 and 21 January 2014 indicate that the Sub-Inspector of Lokayukta is an authorized person for the purpose of s.22 of the MMDR Act – The FIR that was filed to overcome the bar u/s. 22 has been signed by the Sub-Inspector of Lokayukta Police and the information was given by the SIT – Therefore, the respondent had complied with s.22 MMDR Act. Procedure, 1973 – Vicarious liability – Allegations of purchasing and selling extracted iron ore illegally without mining dispatch permits and the payments of charges to the Mining and Geological Departments and the Forest Department – FIR registered and a final report u/s. 173 of Cr.P.C. submitted – Additional City and Civil Sessions Judge and Special Judge took cognizance after perusing the final report – It was contended that the charge- sheet does not ascribe any role to A-1 and hence the process initiated against him must be quashed – Held : The determination of whether the conditions stipulated in s.23 of the MMDR Act have been fulfilled is a matter of trial – Moreover, it is evident that the charge sheet, as a matter of fact, ascribes a role to A-1 and A-2 for the payment of transportation – Therefore, there is a prima facie case against A-1, which is sufficient to arraign him as an accused at this stage.",

Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 – s. 193 – Mines and Mineral (Development and Regulation) Act, 1957 – Karnataka Forest Rules, 1969 – Cognizance of the offence and not the offender – The Special Judge by an order mentions that cognizance is taken against the accused – Whether merely because the cognizance order mentions that cognizance is taken against the ‘accused’, the entire proceedings would be vitiated – Held : It is a settled principle of law that cognizance is taken of the offence and not the offender – However, the cognizance order indicates that the Special Judge has perused all the relevant material relating to the case before cognizance was taken – The change in the form of the order would not alter its effect – The order taking cognizance inadvertently mentioned that the Special Judge has taken cognizance against the accused instead of the offence – This would not vitiate the entire proceedings. Mines and Mineral (Development and Regulation) Act, 1957 – Karnataka Forest Rules, 1969 – Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 – ss. 193, 220 – Penal Code, 1860 – Cognizance by the Special Court of the offences under IPC – It was contended that even if the Special Judge had the power to take cognizance of the offence, he could only have taken cognizance of offences under the MMDR Act and could not have taken cognizance (and conduct trial) of the offences under the provisions of IPC – Held : Since offences under IPC are alleged to have been committed in the course of the same transaction as the offences under the MMDR Act, the situation is squarely covered by sub-section (1) of s.220 of CrPC – The Special Court has the power to take cognizance of offences under MMDR Act and conduct a joint trial with other offences if permissible u/s. 220 CrPC – There is no express provision in the MMDR Act which indicates that s.220 CrPC does not apply to proceedings under the MMDR Act. Mines and Mineral (Development and Regulation) Act, 1957 – Karnataka Forest Rules, 1969 – Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 – s. 193 – Cognizance order and non-application of mind – Allegations of purchasing and selling extracted iron ore illegally without mining dispatch permits and the payments of charges to the Mining and Geological Departments and the Forest Department – FIR registered and a final report u/s. 173 of Cr.P.C. submitted – Additional City and Civil Sessions Judge and Special Judge took cognizance after perusing the final report – It was contended that the order of the Special Judge taking cognizance has not sufficiently demonstrated application of mind to the material placed before him – Held : The Special Judge, took cognizance on the basis of a report submitted u/s. 173 CrPC and not on the basis of a private complaint – The Special Judge took note of the FIR, the witness statements, and connected documents before taking cognizance of the offence – In this backdrop, it would be far-fetched to fault the order of the Special Judge on the ground that it does not adduce detailed reasons for taking cognizance or that it does not indicate that an application of mind. Mines and Mineral (Development and Regulation) Act, 1957 – s.22 – Karnataka Forest Rules, 1969 – Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 – Allegations of purchasing and selling extracted iron ore illegally without mining dispatch permits and the payments of charges to the Mining and Geological Departments and the Forest Department – FIR registered and a final report u/s. 173 of Cr.P.C. submitted – Additional City and Civil Sessions Judge and Special Judge took cognizance after perusing the final report – Appellant contended that before the Special Court (Sessions Court) took cognizance of the offence, no complaint was filed by the authorised person – Held : A combined reading of the notifications dated 29 May 2014 and 21 January 2014 indicate that the Sub-Inspector of Lokayukta is an authorized person for the purpose of s.22 of the MMDR Act – The FIR that was filed to overcome the bar u/s. 22 has been signed by the Sub-Inspector of Lokayukta Police and the information was given by the SIT – Therefore, the respondent had complied with s.22 MMDR Act. Procedure, 1973 – Vicarious liability – Allegations of purchasing and selling extracted iron ore illegally without mining dispatch permits and the payments of charges to the Mining and Geological Departments and the Forest Department – FIR registered and a final report u/s. 173 of Cr.P.C. submitted – Additional City and Civil Sessions Judge and Special Judge took cognizance after perusing the final report – It was contended that the charge- sheet does not ascribe any role to A-1 and hence the process initiated against him must be quashed – Held : The determination of whether the conditions stipulated in s.23 of the MMDR Act have been fulfilled is a matter of trial – Moreover, it is evident that the charge sheet, as a matter of fact, ascribes a role to A-1 and A-2 for the payment of transportation – Therefore, there is a prima facie case against A-1, which is sufficient to arraign him as an accused at this stage.",

Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 – s. 193 – Mines and Mineral (Development and Regulation) Act, 1957 – Karnataka Forest Rules, 1969 – Cognizance of the offence and not the offender – The Special Judge by an order mentions that cognizance is taken against the accused – Whether merely because the cognizance order mentions that cognizance is taken against the ‘accused’, the entire proceedings would be vitiated – Held : It is a settled principle of law that cognizance is taken of the offence and not the offender – However, the cognizance order indicates that the Special Judge has perused all the relevant material relating to the case before cognizance was taken – The change in the form of the order would not alter its effect – The order taking cognizance inadvertently mentioned that the Special Judge has taken cognizance against the accused instead of the offence – This would not vitiate the entire proceedings. Mines and Mineral (Development and Regulation) Act, 1957 – Karnataka Forest Rules, 1969 – Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 – ss. 193, 220 – Penal Code, 1860 – Cognizance by the Special Court of the offences under IPC – It was contended that even if the Special Judge had the power to take cognizance of the offence, he could only have taken cognizance of offences under the MMDR Act and could not have taken cognizance (and conduct trial) of the offences under the provisions of IPC – Held : Since offences under IPC are alleged to have been committed in the course of the same transaction as the offences under the MMDR Act, the situation is squarely covered by sub-section (1) of s.220 of CrPC – The Special Court has the power to take cognizance of offences under MMDR Act and conduct a joint trial with other offences if permissible u/s. 220 CrPC – There is no express provision in the MMDR Act which indicates that s.220 CrPC does not apply to proceedings under the MMDR Act.
