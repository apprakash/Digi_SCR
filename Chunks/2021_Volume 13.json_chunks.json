A Consumer Protection Act, 2019 – s.35(1)(c) – Interpretation of – Sine qua non for invoking s.35(1)(c) is that all consumers on whose behalf or for whose benefit the provision is invoked, should have the same interest – Interestingly, s.35(1) (c) uses the disjunction “or” in between two sets of words, namely, (i) “on behalf of”; and (ii) “for the benefit of” – A complaint filed under s.35(1)(c) could either be “on behalf of” or “for the benefit of” all consumers having the same interest – Or.I r.8, CPC, unlike s.35(1)(c) operates both ways and contains provisions for a two-way traffic – It not only permits plaintiffs to sue in a representative capacity but also permits people to be sued and to be defended in an action, in a representative capacity – Since “sameness of interest” is the pre- requisite for an application under Or.I r.8, CPC read with s.35(1)(c) of the Consumer Protection Act, 2019, it was necessary for the respondents to include in the consumer complaint, sufficient averments that would show sameness of interest. D Consumer Protection Act, 2019: s.35(1)(c) – Sameness of interest – The period of delay in the completion of project and handing over of possession, does not appear to be uniform in all 1134 cases – Complainants cannot project sameness of interest for the purchasers in whose case the period of delay was negligible and those in whose cases there was a huge delay. Consumer Protection Act, 1986: Consumer Protection Act, 2019 – s.12(1)(c) of the 1986 Act or s.35(1)(c) of the 2019 Act – For allowing an application under s.12(1)(c) of the 1986 Act or s.35(1)(c) of the 2019 Act, the pleadings and the reliefs are to be considered – If so considered, National Commission could not have granted permission to the respondents in this case, to file the complaint in a representative capacity for and on behalf of the owners of all the 1134 flats. Consumer Protection Act, 2019: s.2(5)(i), s.36(1) – Interpretation of – Consumer – It is true that s.2(5)(i) uses the expression “a consumer” – If the vowel “a” and the word “consumer” appearing in s.2(5)(i) are to be understood to exclude more than one person, it will result in a disastrous consequence while reading s.2(5)(vi) – s.2(5)(vi) states that in the case of death of a consumer, “his legal heir or legal representative” will be a complainant – Unless the words “legal heir” and “legal representative” are understood to mean ‘legal heirs’ and ‘legal representatives’, a meaningful reading of the provision may not be there – Under s.13(2) of the General Clauses Act, 1897, words in the singular shall include the plural and vice versa in all Central Acts and Regulations, unless there is anything repugnant in the subject or context – Anything repugnant cannot be read in the subject or context of s. 2(5) or 35(1)(c) or 38(11) of the Consumer Protection Act, 2019 to hold that the word in the singular, namely, “consumer” will not include the plural – The proper way of interpreting s.35(1) read with s.2(5), would be to say that a complaint may be filed: (i) by a single consumer; (ii) by a recognised consumer Association; (iii) by one or more consumers jointly, seeking the redressal of their own grievances without representing other consumers who may or may not have the same interest; (iv) by one or more consumers on behalf of or for the benefit of numerous consumers; and (v) the Central Government, Central Authority or State Authority.",

Waqf Act, 1995 – ss.83, 85, as amended by Amendment Act 27 of 2013 – Held: Act 27 of 2013 did 2 things – First it expanded the jurisdiction of Waqf Tribunal even to cover landlord-tenant disputes and the rights and obligations of lessor and lessee – Second, it enlarged the bar of jurisdiction, to cover even revenue courts and other authorities.

Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 – Right of Appellant to terminate Power Purchase Agreement – Whether the appellant‘s right to terminate the PPA in terms of Article 9.2.1(e) read with 9.3.1 is regulated by the IBC – Held: In accordance with Article 9.3.1 of PPA, the appellant, on the occurrence of an Event of Default u/Article 9.2.1, can issue a default notice which shall specify in reasonable detail the Event of Default giving rise to the default notice, and call upon the Corporate Debtor to remedy it – At the expiry of 30 days from such notice, unless otherwise agreed, if the default has not been remedied, the appellant can terminate the PPA – In the instant case, it is the sole contract for the sale of electricity which was entered into by the corporate debtor – The PPA was terminated solely on the ground of insolvency, which gives the NCLT jurisdiction u/s. 60(5)(c) to adjudicate this matter and invalidate the termination of the PPA – NCLT is the forum vested with the responsibility of ensuring the continuation of the insolvency resolution process, which requires preservation of the Corporate Debtor as a going concern – The NCLT/NCLAT correctly stayed the termination of the PPA by the appellant, since allowing it to terminate the PPA would certainly result in the corporate death of the Corporate Debtor due to the PPA being its sole contract. Interpretation of Statutes – Textually similar language in different enactments has to be construed in the context and scheme of the statute in which the words appear – The meaning and content attributed to statutory language in one enactment cannot in all circumstances be transplanted into a distinct, if not, alien soil – It is trite law that the words of a statute have to be construed in a manner which would give them a sensible meaning which accords with the overall scheme of the statute, the context in which the words are used and the purpose of the underlying provision – Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code – sec. 60(5) – Companies Act, 1956 – 446(2).

Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 – Right of Appellant to terminate Power Purchase Agreement – Whether the appellant‘s right to terminate the PPA in terms of Article 9.2.1(e) read with 9.3.1 is regulated by the IBC – Held: In accordance with Article 9.3.1 of PPA, the appellant, on the occurrence of an Event of Default u/Article 9.2.1, can issue a default notice which shall specify in reasonable detail the Event of Default giving rise to the default notice, and call upon the Corporate Debtor to remedy it – At the expiry of 30 days from such notice, unless otherwise agreed, if the default has not been remedied, the appellant can terminate the PPA – In the instant case, it is the sole contract for the sale of electricity which was entered into by the corporate debtor – The PPA was terminated solely on the ground of insolvency, which gives the NCLT jurisdiction u/s. 60(5)(c) to adjudicate this matter and invalidate the termination of the PPA – NCLT is the forum vested with the responsibility of ensuring the continuation of the insolvency resolution process, which requires preservation of the Corporate Debtor as a going concern – The NCLT/NCLAT correctly stayed the termination of the PPA by the appellant, since allowing it to terminate the PPA would certainly result in the corporate death of the Corporate Debtor due to the PPA being its sole contract. Interpretation of Statutes – Textually similar language in different enactments has to be construed in the context and scheme of the statute in which the words appear – The meaning and content attributed to statutory language in one enactment cannot in all circumstances be transplanted into a distinct, if not, alien soil – It is trite law that the words of a statute have to be construed in a manner which would give them a sensible meaning which accords with the overall scheme of the statute, the context in which the words are used and the purpose of the underlying provision – Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code – sec. 60(5) – Companies Act, 1956 – 446(2).

General Clauses Act, 1897: s. 6 – Effect of repeal under – Accrual of privilege – Held: Where a central enactment repeals another enactment, the repeal shall not affect the any legal proceeding or investigation with respect to an accrued right, unless a different intention appears from a repealing statute – Privilege is accrued only when the privilege holder does an act required to avail the privilege – It is not the mere hope or expectation of accrual. Constitution of India: Art. 14 – Right to Equality – Principle of Reasonable Accommodation – Held: Is one of the means for achieving substantive equality, pursuant to which disabled individuals must be reasonably accommodated based on their individual capacities – Disability, as a social construct, precedes the medical condition of an individual, and sense of disability is introduced because of the absence of access to facilities. Interpretation of statutes: Rule of interpretation – Held: If two interpretation possible, the interpretation which furthers international law or gives effect to international law must be preferred – Since Art. 5 of the Convention places the States under an obligation to provide both formal and substantive equality, an interpretation of the PwD Act that furthers the principles mentioned in Art. 5 must be undertaken, India being the signatory and having ratified the Convention – Thus, even though the PwD Act does not have an express provision laying down the general principle of non-discrimination against disabled persons, it must still have to be read in the statute – United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities – Art. 5 – Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act 2016 – Persons with Disabilities (Equal Opportunities, Protection of Rights and Full Participation) Act 1951.

Interpretation of statutes: Rule of interpretation – Held: If two interpretation possible, the interpretation which furthers international law or gives effect to international law must be preferred – Since Art. 5 of the Convention places the States under an obligation to provide both formal and substantive equality, an interpretation of the PwD Act that furthers the principles mentioned in Art. 5 must be undertaken, India being the signatory and having ratified the Convention – Thus, even though the PwD Act does not have an express provision laying down the general principle of non-discrimination against disabled persons, it must still have to be read in the statute – United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities – Art. 5 – Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act 2016 – Persons with Disabilities (Equal Opportunities, Protection of Rights and Full Participation) Act 1951.

General Clauses Act, 1897: s. 6 – Effect of repeal under – Accrual of privilege – Held: Where a central enactment repeals another enactment, the repeal shall not affect the any legal proceeding or investigation with respect to an accrued right, unless a different intention appears from a repealing statute – Privilege is accrued only when the privilege holder does an act required to avail the privilege – It is not the mere hope or expectation of accrual. Constitution of India: Art. 14 – Right to Equality – Principle of Reasonable Accommodation – Held: Is one of the means for achieving substantive equality, pursuant to which disabled individuals must be reasonably accommodated based on their individual capacities – Disability, as a social construct, precedes the medical condition of an individual, and sense of disability is introduced because of the absence of access to facilities. Interpretation of statutes: Rule of interpretation – Held: If two interpretation possible, the interpretation which furthers international law or gives effect to international law must be preferred – Since Art. 5 of the Convention places the States under an obligation to provide both formal and substantive equality, an interpretation of the PwD Act that furthers the principles mentioned in Art. 5 must be undertaken, India being the signatory and having ratified the Convention – Thus, even though the PwD Act does not have an express provision laying down the general principle of non-discrimination against disabled persons, it must still have to be read in the statute – United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities – Art. 5 – Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act 2016 – Persons with Disabilities (Equal Opportunities, Protection of Rights and Full Participation) Act 1951.

General Clauses Act, 1897: s. 6 – Effect of repeal under – Accrual of privilege – Held: Where a central enactment repeals another enactment, the repeal shall not affect the any legal proceeding or investigation with respect to an accrued right, unless a different intention appears from a repealing statute – Privilege is accrued only when the privilege holder does an act required to avail the privilege – It is not the mere hope or expectation of accrual. Constitution of India: Art. 14 – Right to Equality – Principle of Reasonable Accommodation – Held: Is one of the means for achieving substantive equality, pursuant to which disabled individuals must be reasonably accommodated based on their individual capacities – Disability, as a social construct, precedes the medical condition of an individual, and sense of disability is introduced because of the absence of access to facilities. Interpretation of statutes: Rule of interpretation – Held: If two interpretation possible, the interpretation which furthers international law or gives effect to international law must be preferred – Since Art. 5 of the Convention places the States under an obligation to provide both formal and substantive equality, an interpretation of the PwD Act that furthers the principles mentioned in Art. 5 must be undertaken, India being the signatory and having ratified the Convention – Thus, even though the PwD Act does not have an express provision laying down the general principle of non-discrimination against disabled persons, it must still have to be read in the statute – United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities – Art. 5 – Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act 2016 – Persons with Disabilities (Equal Opportunities, Protection of Rights and Full Participation) Act 1951.
