Evidence – Confession – Lajpat Nagar Bomb Blast Case of1996 – 17 accused – Judicial confession of A9, if recorded as perthe mandate of law or not – Held: On facts, the testimony of judicialofficer PW100 is evidently clear – Two days’ time for such purposeswas given to the accused and that too, after apprising him of theconsequences of making such statement and only after finding himto have voluntarily chosen to depose, was such a confessionalstatement recorded – That apart, it was not the case of the saidaccused that a judicial confession was got extracted under threat,extortion, promise or as a result of blackmail – Hence, the statementwas totally voluntary in nature – A conjoint reading of s.164 CrPCand ss.24 to 30 of the Evidence Act, makes the confession made byA9 to be entirely admissible in evidence and by virtue of s.10 of theEvidence Act, in a given case also against a co-accused – TheMagistrate was duly empowered to record the confession, though,it would not matter whether he had the jurisdiction in the case ornot – It was without any inducement, threat or promise and wasrelevant for adjudication of the issues/subject matter of trial – Thesame led to a discovery of fact and the disclosure statements of theco-accused also resulted into discovery of fact – The statement wasneither retracted nor its credibility and veracity ever doubted – Itwas voluntary and truthful, reliable and beyond reproach and hence,an efficacious piece of evidence – Establishing the guilt of theaccused, the said confession falls squarely within the contours laiddown in Ram Singh case – Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 –s.164 – Evidence Act, 1872 – ss.10, 24 to 30.Evidence – Confession – What is – Meaning of – Held: Aconfession is an admission made at any time by a person chargedwith an offence, stating or suggesting the inference that he hascommitted the offence – In law, such confession can be made before“any” metropolitan magistrate or judicial magistrate, whether ornot, he has jurisdiction in the case.Evidence – Confession – Corroboration, if necessary – Held:It is not necessary that each and every circumstance mentioned inthe confession regarding complicity of the accused should beseparately and independently corroborated, nor is it essential thatcorroboration must come from facts and circumstances discoveredafter the confession was made – It would be sufficient if the general trend of the confession is substantiated by some evidence whichwould tally with what is contained in the confession.Sentence / Sentencing – Life imprisonment vis-à-vis deathpenalty – Rule of prudence – Held: A Court may choose to giveprimacy to life imprisonment over death penalty – Considering thefacts at hand and evidence on record, in the case at hand (LajpatNagar Bomb Blast Case of 1996), one has to be conscious of thefact that the bomb blast caused at the behest of the accused personsresulted in the death of 13 persons and 38 persons suffered injuries– There was further damage caused to the livelihood of theshopkeepers, whose shops were burnt down due to the said bombblast – However, the incident took place on 21.05.1996, i.e.,approximately 27 years ago; the Trial Court awarded the sentenceof death on 22.04.2010, i.e., more than 13 years ago; and the presentaccused acted at the behest of the principal conspirators; whichare all mitigating circumstances in not awarding the sentence ofdeath even though it falls within the category of rarest of rare cases– Fit case to award life imprisonment without remission, extendingto natural life of A3, A5, A6 and A9.Administration of Criminal Justice – Criminal Trial –Expeditious Trial – Need for – Lajpat Nagar Bomb Blast Case of1996 – Held: On facts, the record reveals it is only on the proddingon the part of the judiciary that the trial could be completed aftermore than a decade – The delay, be it for whatever reason,attributable to the judge incharge or the prosecution, has certainlycompromised national interest – Expeditious trial of such cases isthe need of the hour, especially when it concerns national securityand the common man – Enough vigilance was not displayed by theinvestigating as well as the judicial authorities – The matter oughtto have been handled with urgency and sensitivity at all levels.Criminal Law – Law on interference against acquittal by HighCourts – Discussed – Constitution of India – Art. 136.Evidence – Hostile Witness – Admissibility and evidentiaryvalue of – Discussed.Evidence – Circumstantial Evidence – Evidentiary Value –Conviction on its basis – Discussed.",

VigilanceCommission Act), the Delhi Special Police Establishment(Amendment) Act, 2021 (whereby two new provisos were inserted tos.4B(1) of the Delhi Special Police Establishment Act, 1946) andthe Fundamental (Amendment) Rules, 2021 (whereby the fifth provisoto F.R. 56(d) was substituted by a new proviso) – Challenge to –Held: The argument that the impugned Amendments grant arbitrarypower to the Government to extend the tenure of the Director ofED/CBI and has the effect of wiping out the insulation of theseoffices from extraneous pressures, is not tenable – It is not at thesweet-will of the Government that the extensions can be granted tothe incumbents in the office of the Director of CBI /Director ofEnforcement – What has been directed by this Court in the case ofVineet Narain and in subsequent judgments relied on by thepetitioners is that such Director should have a minimum tenure oftwo years irrespective of their date of superannuation – By theimpugned Amendments, the said period is not tinkered with – Whathas been done is only a power is given to extend their period for aperiod of one year at a time, subject to a maximum number of threesuch extensions – However, this has to be done only when theCommittee which is constituted to recommend their appointment findsit necessary, in public interest, to grant such extension – It is furtherrequired to record the reasons in writing for the said purpose –When a Committee can be trusted with regard to recommending theirinitial appointment, there is no reason as to why such Committeescannot be trusted to consider as to whether the extension is required to be given in public interest or not – Challenge to validity of CentralVigilance Commission (Amendment) Act, 2021, the Delhi SpecialPolice Establishment (Amendment) Act, 2021, and the Fundamental(Amendment) Rules, 2021 not tenable.Mandamus – Nullification of, by enactment – Issue of legislativeoverride – Intrusion into judicial power by the legislature –Incumbents in the office of the Director of CBI /Director ofEnforcement – Extension of tenure – Whether the impugned ordersdated 17th November, 2021 and 17th November 2022, which grantedextensions to the tenure of respondent no.2-Director of Enforcementfor a period of one year each, were not valid in light of the specificmandamus issued by this Court in the earlier case of Common Cause(2021) that no further extension shall be granted to respondent no.2– Held: Effect of the judgments of this court can be nullified by alegislative act removing the basis of the judgment – Such law canbe retrospective – However, retrospective amendment should bereasonable and not arbitrary and must not be violative of thefundamental rights guaranteed under the Constitution – Defectpointed out should be cured such that the basis of the judgmentpointing out the defect is removed – Nullification of mandamus byan enactment, however, would be impermissible legislative exercise– Transgression of constitutional limitations and intrusion into thejudicial power by the legislature is violative of the principle ofseparation of powers, the rule of law and of Art.14 of the Constitution– In the case of Common Cause (2021), this Court had specificallyissued a mandamus that no further extension shall be granted torespondent no.2 – The Union of India and respondent No.2 wereboth parties in the proceedings before this Court in Common Cause(2021) – The mandamus issued to be parties was binding on them –Therefore, respondent No.1 could not have issued orders dated 17thNovember 2021 and 17th November 2022 (granting extensions tothe tenure of respondent No.2 for a period of one year each) inbreach of the mandamus issued by this Court in Common Cause(2021) – The impugned orders dated 17th November 2021 and 17thNovember 2022 are accordingly illegal – However, on facts, in thelarger public interest, respondent No.2 permitted to continue in officetill 31st July, 2023 – Constitution of India – Art. 14 – Service Law.Judicial review – Scope of, in examining legislative functionsof the Legislature – Role of the judiciary – Held: Judicial review is a powerful weapon to restrain unconstitutional exercise of powerby the legislature and executive – The role of the Court is limited toexamine as to whether the Legislature or the Executive has actedwithin the powers and functions assigned under the Constitution –However, while doing so, the Court must remain within its selfimposedlimits.Judicial review – Of Legislative enactment – Scope – Held:Statute enacted by Parliament or a State Legislature cannot bedeclared unconstitutional lightly – Unless there is flagrant violationof the constitutional provisions, the law made by Parliament or aState Legislature cannot be declared bad – Legislative enactmentcan be struck down only on two grounds – Firstly, that the appropriatelegislature does not have the competence to make the law; andsecondly, that it takes away or abridges any of the fundamentalrights enumerated in Part III of the Constitution or any otherconstitutional provisions – No enactment can be struck down byjust saying that it is arbitrary or unreasonable – Some or the otherconstitutional infirmity has to be found before invalidating an Act –Parliament and the legislatures, composed as they are of therepresentatives of the people, are supposed to know

Fundamental (Amendment) Rules, 2021 (whereby the fifth provisoto F.R. 56(d) was substituted by a new proviso) – Challenge to –Held: The argument that the impugned Amendments grant arbitrarypower to the Government to extend the tenure of the Director ofED/CBI and has the effect of wiping out the insulation of theseoffices from extraneous pressures, is not tenable – It is not at thesweet-will of the Government that the extensions can be granted tothe incumbents in the office of the Director of CBI /Director ofEnforcement – What has been directed by this Court in the case ofVineet Narain and in subsequent judgments relied on by thepetitioners is that such Director should have a minimum tenure oftwo years irrespective of their date of superannuation – By theimpugned Amendments, the said period is not tinkered with – Whathas been done is only a power is given to extend their period for aperiod of one year at a time, subject to a maximum number of threesuch extensions – However, this has to be done only when theCommittee which is constituted to recommend their appointment findsit necessary, in public interest, to grant such extension – It is furtherrequired to record the reasons in writing for the said purpose –When a Committee can be trusted with regard to recommending theirinitial appointment, there is no reason as to why such Committeescannot be trusted to consider as to whether the extension is required to be given in public interest or not – Challenge to validity of CentralVigilance Commission (Amendment) Act, 2021, the Delhi SpecialPolice Establishment (Amendment) Act, 2021, and the Fundamental(Amendment) Rules, 2021 not tenable.Mandamus – Nullification of, by enactment – Issue of legislativeoverride – Intrusion into judicial power by the legislature –Incumbents in the office of the Director of CBI /Director ofEnforcement – Extension of tenure – Whether the impugned ordersdated 17th November, 2021 and 17th November 2022, which grantedextensions to the tenure of respondent no.2-Director of Enforcementfor a period of one year each, were not valid in light of the specificmandamus issued by this Court in the earlier case of Common Cause(2021) that no further extension shall be granted to respondent no.2– Held: Effect of the judgments of this court can be nullified by alegislative act removing the basis of the judgment – Such law canbe retrospective – However, retrospective amendment should bereasonable and not arbitrary and must not be violative of thefundamental rights guaranteed under the Constitution – Defectpointed out should be cured such that the basis of the judgmentpointing out the defect is removed – Nullification of mandamus byan enactment, however, would be impermissible legislative exercise– Transgression of constitutional limitations and intrusion into thejudicial power by the legislature is violative of the principle ofseparation of powers, the rule of law and of Art.14 of the Constitution– In the case of Common Cause (2021), this Court had specificallyissued a mandamus that no further extension shall be granted torespondent no.2 – The Union of India and respondent No.2 wereboth parties in the proceedings before this Court in Common Cause(2021) – The mandamus issued to be parties was binding on them –Therefore, respondent No.1 could not have issued orders dated 17thNovember 2021 and 17th

India – Art. 14 – Service Law.Judicial review – Scope of, in examining legislative functionsof the Legislature – Role of the judiciary – Held: Judicial review is a powerful weapon to restrain unconstitutional exercise of powerby the legislature and executive – The role of the Court is limited toexamine as to whether the Legislature or the Executive has actedwithin the powers and functions assigned under the Constitution –However, while doing so, the Court must remain within its selfimposedlimits.Judicial review – Of Legislative enactment – Scope – Held:Statute enacted by Parliament or a State Legislature cannot bedeclared unconstitutional lightly – Unless there is flagrant violationof the constitutional provisions, the law made by Parliament or aState Legislature cannot be declared bad – Legislative enactmentcan be struck down only on two grounds – Firstly, that the appropriatelegislature does not have the competence to make the law; andsecondly, that it takes away or abridges any of the fundamentalrights enumerated in Part III of the Constitution or any otherconstitutional provisions – No enactment can be struck down byjust saying that it is arbitrary or unreasonable –

        "HeadNote": "Constitution of India – Art. 19(1)(a) and 19(2) – Freedom ofSpeech and Expression – Freedom of Press – Reasonable Restriction– National Security – The Union Ministry of Information andBroadcasting (MIB) revoked the permission which it had grantedto Madhyamam Broadcasting Limited to uplink and downlink a newsand current affairs television channel called “Media One” – MIBrevoked the permission that was granted to uplink and downlink‘Media One’ because of the denial of a security clearance –Appellants initiated proceedings under Article 226 of theConstitution before the High Court for challenging the action ofthe first respondent – A Single Judge dismissed the petitions – Writappeal was dismissed by the Division Bench of the High Court –The High Court relied on material which was disclosed solely to theCourt in a sealed cover by the second respondent, the Union Ministryof Home Affairs – Held: The challenge to the order of the MIB andjudgment of the High Court on procedural grounds is allowed –The core of the principles of natural justice breathes reasonablenessinto procedure – The burden is on the claimant to prove that theprocedure followed infringes upon the core of proceduralguarantees – The appellants have proved that MBL’s right to a fairhearing has been infringed by the unreasoned order of the MIB,and the non-disclosure of relevant material to the appellants, andits disclosure solely to the court – The burden then shifts on therespondents to prove that the procedure that was followed wasreasonable and in compliance with the requirements of Articles 14and 21 of the Constitution – Though confidentiality and nationalsecurity are legitimate aims for the purpose of limiting proceduralguarantees, the state has been unable to prove that theseconsiderations arise in the present factual scenario – A blanket immunity from disclosure of all investigative reports cannot begranted – The validity of the claim of involvement of national securityconsiderations must be assessed on the test of (i) whether there ismaterial to conclude that the non-disclosure of information is in theinterest of national security; and (ii) whether a reasonable prudentperson would draw the same inference from the material on record–Even assuming that non-disclosure is in the interest of confidentialityand national security, the means adopted by the respondents do notsatisfy the other prongs of the proportionality standard – The nondisclosureof a summary of the reasons for the denial of securityclearance to MBL, which constitutes the core irreducible minimumof procedural guarantees, does not satisfy the suitability prong –The challenge to the order of MIB is allowed on substantive grounds– The non-renewal of permission to operate a media channel is arestriction on the freedom of the press which can only be reasonablyrestricted on the grounds stipulated in Article 19(2) of theConstitution – The reasons for denying a security clearance to MBL,that is, its alleged anti-establishment stance and the alleged link ofthe shareholders to JEI-H, are not legitimate purposes for therestriction of the right of freedom of speech protected under Article19(1)(a) of the Constitution – In any event, there was no material todemonstrate any link of the shareholders, as was alleged.National Security – Concerns of – Held: Do not permit anabsolute abrogation of the principles of natural justice – The mereinvolvement of issues concerning national security would notpreclude the state’s duty to act fairly – However, the principle ofnatural justice may be excluded when on the facts of the case,national security concerns outweigh the duty of fairness – Thus,national security is one of the few grounds on which the right to areasonable procedural guarantee may be restricted – If the Statediscards its duty to act fairly, then it must be justified before thecourt on the facts of the case – Firstly, the State must satisfy theCourt that national security concerns are involved – Secondly, theState must satisfy the court that an abrogation of the principle(s) ofnatural justice is justified – These two standards that have emergedfrom the jurisprudence abroad resemble the proportionality standard– The first test resembles the legitimate aim prong, and the second test of justification resembles the necessity and the balancing prongs– It is not sufficient for the State to identify its purpose in broadconceptual terms such as national security and public order – Rather,it is imperative for the State to prove through the submission ofcogent material that non-disclosure is in the interest of nationalsecurity – It is the Court’s duty to assess if there is sufficient materialfor forming such an opinion – A claim cannot be made out of thinair without material backing for such a conclusion – The Courtmust determine if the State makes the claim in a bona fide manner –The Court must assess the validity of the claim of purpose bydetermining (i) whether there is material to conclude that the nondisclosureof the information is in the interest of national security;and (ii) whether a reasonable prudent person would arrive at thesame conclusion based on the material – The court allows duedeference to the State to form its opinion but reviews the opinion onlimited grounds of whether there is nexus between the material andthe conclusion – The Court cannot second-guess the judgment ofthe State that the purpose identified would violate India’s nationalsecurity – It is the executive wing and not the judicial wing that hasthe knowledge of India’s geo-political relationships to assess if anaction is in the interest of India’s national security – Natural Justice.Investigative agencies – Reports of – Held: The reports ofthe intelligence agencies are not merely fact-finding reports – Toargue that reports of the intelligence agencies may containconfidential information is one thing but to argue that the all suchreports are confidential is another – Such an argument is misplacedand cannot be accepted on the touchstone of constitutional values– The reports by investigative agencies impact decisions on the life,liberty, and profession of individuals and entities, and to give suchreports absolute immunity from disclosure is antithetical to atransparent and accountable system – A blanket immunity fromdisclosure of all investigative reports cannot be granted.Practice and Procedure – Disclosure of Relevant Material –Open Justice – Sealed cover procedure – Effect of – Less RestrictiveMeans – Public interest immunity claim – Suggestive Course of Action– Held: Sealed cover procedures violate both principles of naturaljustice and open justice – When relevant material is disclosed in asealed cover, there are two injuries that are perpetuated – First, the documents are not available to the affected party – Second, thedocuments are relied upon by the opposite party (which is mostoften the State) in the course of the arguments, and the court arrivesat a finding by relying on the material – In such a case, the affectedparty does not have any recourse to legal remedies because it wouldbe unable to (dis)prove any inferences from the material before theadjudicating authority – This form of adjudication perpetuates aculture of secrecy and opaqueness, and places the judgment beyondthe reach of challenge – The affected party would be unable to“contradict errors, identify omissions, challenge the credibility ofinformants or refute false allegations” – The right to seek judicialreview which has now been read into Arts. 14 and 21 is restricted –A corresponding effect of the sealed cover procedure is a nonreasonedorder – If the purpose could be realised effectively bypublic interest immunity proceedings or any other less restrictivemeans, then the sealed cover procedure should not be adopted –The court should undertake an analysis of the possible proceduralmodalities that could be used to realise the purpose, and the meansthat are less restrictive of the procedural guarantees must be adopted– The courts could take the course of redacting confidential portionsof the document and providing a summary of the contents of thedocument to fairly exclude materials after a successful public interestimmunity claim.Practice and Procedure – Difference between sealed coverprocedure and public interest immunity claims – Held: One crucialdifference between the sealed cover procedure and public interestimmunity claims is that in the former, the court relies on the materialthat is disclosed in a sealed cover in the course of the proceedings,as opposed to the latter where the documents are completely removedfrom the proceedings and both the parties and the adjudicator cannotrely on such material – The courts assess the validity of publicinterest immunity claims, which address the same harms as the sealedcover procedure, based on the structured proportionality standard– The power of courts to secure material in a sealed cover whencontradistinguished with the scope of assessment of public interestimmunity claims is rather unguided and ad-hoc – The standard ofreview that is used by the courts in public interest immunity claimsand the lack of such a standard in sealed cover proceedings to protect procedural safeguards indicates that public interest immunityclaims constitute less restrictive means – Additionally, while publicinterest immunity claims conceivably impact the principles of naturaljustice, sealed cover proceedings infringe the principles naturaljustice and open justice.Practice and Procedure – Public interest immunity claim –Held: While Public interest immunity claim is a less restrictive means,the dilution of procedural guarantees while hearing the claim cannotbe ignored by the Court – The court has a duty to consider factorssuch as the relevance of the material to the case of the applicantwhile undertaking the proportionality standard to test the publicinterest immunity claim.Media – Press – Role and independence of – Held: Anindependent press is vital for the robust functioning of a democraticrepublic – Its role in a democratic society is crucial for it shines alight on the functioning of the state – The press has a duty to speaktruth to power, and present citizens with hard facts enabling them tomake choices that propel democracy in the right direction – Therestriction on the freedom of the press compels citizens to think alongthe same tangent – A homogenised view on issues that range fromsocio-economic polity to political ideologies would pose gravedangers to democracy – On facts, the critical views of the Channel,Media-One on policies of the government cannot be termed, ‘antiestablishment’– The use of such a terminology in itself, representsan expectation that the press must support the establishment – Theaction of the Union Ministry of Information and Broadcasting (MIB)by denying a security clearance to a media channel on the basis ofthe views which the channel is constitutionally entitled to holdproduces a chilling effect on free speech, and in particular on pressfreedom – Criticism of governmental policy can by no stretch ofimagination be brought within the fold of any of the groundsstipulated in Article 19(2) – Constitution of India – Art.19(2).Policy – Union Ministry of Information and Broadcasting(MIB) – Policy Guidelines for Uplinking of Television Channelsfrom India – Paragraph 10.4 of the Uplinking Guidelines asmodified by the ‘permission letter’ indicates that the Union Ministryof Home Affairs (MHA) could deny security clearance on thegrounds of national security and public order – Thus, according to the Uplinking and Downlinking guidelines, security clearance fromMHA is one of the conditions that is required to be fulfilled forrenewal of permission for Uplinking and Downlinking of newschannels.Doctrines / Principles – Natural Justice – Requirement ofreasoned order – Held: The principles of natural justice ensurethat justice is not only done but it is seen to be done as well – Areasoned order is one of the fundamental requirements of fairadministration – A non-reasoned order perpetuates the nonapplicationof judicial mind in assessing the veracity of the inputs– The nexus of the reasons to the order cannot be adjudicated uponif the reasons are not disclosed.Words and Phrases – Expression “national security” –Meaning of – Held: The expression national security does not havea fixed meaning – While courts have attempted to conceptuallydistinguish national security from public order, it is impossible (andperhaps unwise) to lay down a text-book definition of the expressionwhich can help the courts decide if the factual situation is coveredwithin the meaning of the phrase – The phrase derives its meaningfrom the context .",

infringes upon the core of proceduralguarantees – The appellants have proved that MBL’s right to a fairhearing has been infringed by the unreasoned order of the MIB,and the non-disclosure of relevant material to the appellants, andits disclosure solely to the court – The burden then shifts on therespondents to prove that the procedure that was followed wasreasonable and in compliance with the requirements of Articles 14and 21 of the Constitution – Though confidentiality and nationalsecurity are legitimate aims for the purpose of limiting proceduralguarantees, the state has been unable to prove that theseconsiderations arise in the present factual scenario – A blanket immunity from disclosure of all investigative reports cannot begranted – The validity of the claim of involvement of national securityconsiderations must be assessed on the test of (i) whether there ismaterial to conclude that the non-disclosure of information is in theinterest of national security; and (ii) whether a reasonable prudentperson would draw the same inference from the material on record–Even assuming that non-disclosure is in the interest of confidentialityand national security, the means adopted by the respondents do notsatisfy the other prongs of the proportionality standard – The nondisclosureof a summary of the reasons for the denial of securityclearance to MBL, which constitutes the core irreducible minimumof procedural guarantees, does not satisfy the suitability prong –The challenge to the order of MIB is allowed on substantive grounds– The non-renewal of permission to operate a media channel is arestriction on the freedom of the press which can only be reasonablyrestricted on the grounds stipulated in Article 19(2) of theConstitution – The reasons for denying a security clearance to MBL,that is, its alleged anti-establishment stance and the alleged link ofthe shareholders to JEI-H, are not legitimate purposes for therestriction of the right of freedom of speech protected under Article19(1)(a) of the Constitution – In any event, there was no material todemonstrate any link of the shareholders, as was alleged.National Security – Concerns of – Held: Do not permit anabsolute abrogation of the principles of natural justice – The mereinvolvement of issues concerning national security would notpreclude the state’s duty to act fairly – However, the principle ofnatural justice may be excluded when on the facts of the case,national security concerns outweigh the duty of fairness – Thus,national security is one of the few grounds on which the right to areasonable procedural guarantee may be restricted – If the Statediscards its duty to act fairly, then it must be justified before thecourt on the facts of the case – Firstly, the State must satisfy theCourt that national security concerns are involved – Secondly, theState must satisfy the court that an abrogation of the principle(s) ofnatural justice is justified – These two standards that have emergedfrom the jurisprudence abroad resemble the proportionality standard– The first test resembles the legitimate aim prong, and the second test of justification resembles the necessity and the balancing prongs– It is not sufficient for the State to identify its purpose in broadconceptual terms such as national security and public order – Rather,it is imperative for the State to prove through the submission ofcogent material that non-disclosure is in the interest of nationalsecurity – It is the Court’s duty to assess if there is sufficient materialfor forming such an opinion – A claim cannot be made out of thinair without material backing for such a conclusion – The Courtmust determine if the State makes the claim in a bona fide manner –The Court must assess the validity of the claim of purpose bydetermining (i) whether there is material to conclude that the nondisclosureof the information is in the interest of national security;and (ii) whether a reasonable prudent person would arrive at thesame conclusion based on the material – The court allows duedeference to the State to form its opinion but reviews the opinion onlimited grounds of whether there is nexus between the material andthe conclusion – The Court cannot second-guess the judgment ofthe State that the purpose identified would violate India’s nationalsecurity – It is the executive wing and not the judicial wing that hasthe knowledge of India’s geo-political relationships to assess if anaction is in the interest of India’s national security – Natural Justice.Investigative agencies – Reports of – Held: The reports ofthe intelligence agencies are not merely fact-finding reports – Toargue that reports of the intelligence agencies may containconfidential information is one thing but to argue that the all suchreports are confidential is another – Such an argument is misplacedand cannot be accepted on the touchstone of constitutional values– The reports by investigative agencies impact decisions on the life,liberty, and profession of individuals and entities, and to give suchreports absolute immunity from disclosure is antithetical to atransparent and accountable system – A blanket immunity fromdisclosure of all investigative reports cannot be granted.Practice and Procedure – Disclosure of Relevant Material –Open Justice – Sealed cover procedure – Effect of – Less RestrictiveMeans – Public interest immunity claim – Suggestive Course of Action– Held: Sealed cover procedures violate both principles of naturaljustice and open justice – When relevant material is disclosed in asealed cover, there are two injuries that are perpetuated – First, the documents are not available to the affected party – Second, thedocuments are relied upon by the opposite party (which is mostoften the State) in the course of the arguments, and the court arrivesat a finding by relying on the material – In such a case, the affectedparty does not have any recourse to legal remedies because it wouldbe unable to (dis)prove any inferences from the material before theadjudicating authority – This form of adjudication perpetuates aculture of secrecy and opaqueness, and places the judgment beyondthe reach of challenge – The affected party would be unable to“contradict errors, identify omissions, challenge the credibility ofinformants or refute false allegations” – The right to seek judicialreview which has now been read into Arts. 14 and 21 is restricted –A corresponding effect of the sealed cover procedure is a nonreasonedorder – If the purpose could be realised effectively bypublic interest immunity proceedings or any other less restrictivemeans, then the sealed cover procedure should not be adopted –The court should undertake an analysis of the possible proceduralmodalities that could be used to realise the purpose, and the meansthat are less restrictive of the procedural guarantees must be adopted– The courts could take the course of redacting confidential portionsof the document and providing a summary of the contents of thedocument to fairly exclude materials after a successful public interestimmunity claim.Practice and Procedure – Difference between sealed coverprocedure and public interest immunity claims – Held: One crucialdifference between the sealed cover procedure and public interestimmunity claims is that in the former, the court relies on the materialthat is disclosed in a sealed cover in the course of the proceedings,as opposed to the latter where the documents are completely removedfrom the proceedings and both the parties and the adjudicator cannotrely on such material – The courts assess the validity of publicinterest immunity claims, which address the same harms as the sealedcover procedure, based on the structured proportionality standard– The power of courts to secure material in a sealed cover whencontradistinguished with the scope of assessment of public interestimmunity claims is rather unguided and ad-hoc – The standard ofreview that is used by the courts in public interest immunity claimsand the lack of such a standard in sealed cover proceedings to protect procedural safeguards indicates that public interest immunityclaims constitute less restrictive means – Additionally, while publicinterest immunity claims conceivably impact the principles of naturaljustice, sealed cover proceedings infringe the principles naturaljustice and open justice.Practice and Procedure – Public interest immunity claim –Held: While Public interest immunity claim is a less restrictive means,the dilution of procedural guarantees while hearing the claim cannotbe ignored by the Court – The court has a duty to consider factorssuch as the relevance of the material to the case of the applicantwhile undertaking the proportionality standard to test the publicinterest immunity claim.Media – Press – Role and independence of – Held: Anindependent press is vital for the robust functioning of a democraticrepublic – Its role in a democratic society is crucial for it shines alight on the functioning of the state – The press has a duty to speaktruth to power, and present citizens with hard facts enabling them tomake choices that propel democracy in the right direction – Therestriction on the freedom of the press compels citizens to think alongthe same tangent – A homogenised view on issues that range fromsocio-economic polity to political ideologies would pose gravedangers to democracy – On facts, the critical views of the Channel,Media-One on policies of the government cannot be termed, ‘antiestablishment’– The use of such a terminology in itself, representsan expectation that the press must support the establishment – Theaction of the Union Ministry of Information and Broadcasting (MIB)by denying a security clearance to a media channel on the basis ofthe views which the channel is constitutionally entitled to holdproduces a chilling effect on free speech, and in particular on pressfreedom – Criticism of governmental policy can by no stretch ofimagination be brought within the fold of any of the groundsstipulated in Article 19(2) – Constitution of India – Art.19(2).Policy – Union Ministry of Information and Broadcasting(MIB) – Policy Guidelines for Uplinking of Television Channelsfrom India – Paragraph 10.4 of the Uplinking Guidelines asmodified by the ‘permission letter’ indicates that the Union Ministryof Home Affairs (MHA) could deny security clearance on thegrounds of national security and public order – Thus, according to the Uplinking and Downlinking guidelines, security clearance fromMHA is one of the conditions that is required to be fulfilled forrenewal of permission for Uplinking and Downlinking of newschannels.Doctrines / Principles – Natural Justice – Requirement ofreasoned order – Held: The principles of natural justice ensurethat justice is not only done but it is seen to be done as well – Areasoned order is one of the fundamental requirements of fairadministration – A non-reasoned order perpetuates the nonapplicationof judicial mind in assessing the veracity of the inputs– The nexus of the reasons to the order cannot be adjudicated uponif the reasons are not disclosed.Words and Phrases – Expression “national security” –Meaning of – Held: The expression national security does not havea fixed meaning – While courts have attempted to conceptuallydistinguish national security from public order, it is impossible (andperhaps unwise) to lay down a text-book definition of the expressionwhich can help the courts decide if the factual situation is coveredwithin the meaning of the phrase – The phrase derives its meaningfrom the context .",

Ninan v. Kerala State ElectricityBoard, Supreme Court examined such circumstances and held thatthe creation of a charge need not necessarily be based on an expressprovision of the 2003 Act or plenary legislation, but could be createdby properly framed regulations authorized under the parent statute– Thus, in the present case, PVVNL rightly argued that by virtue ofClause 4.3(f)(iv) of the Supply Code, read with the stipulations inthe agreement between the parties, a charge was created on theassets of the corporate debtor – Order of the NCLT also revealsthat this position was accepted – This is evident from the order ofthe NCLAT which clarified that PVVNL also came under thedefinition of ‘secured operational creditor’ as per law – This findingwas affirmed by the impugned order – Therefore, the conclusionthat PVVNL is a secured creditor cannot be disputed – Electricity.Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 – ss.52, 53(1)(e), (f)– Government debts, operational debts vis-à-vis dues owed to unsecured financial creditors–Rationale for placing securedcreditors who relinquish their security, higher in priority– Held:The priority of claims, indicated in the hierarchy of preferences,under the waterfall mechanism accords government debts [clause(e)] and operational debts [clause (f)] lower priority than duesowed to unsecured financial creditors – Further, debts owed to asecured creditor, whenever such secured creditor “has relinquishedsecurity in the manner set out in s. 52” receive a fairly high priority(immediately after insolvency resolution process costs) – When thesecured creditor does not relinquish security, the priority of claim islower [s.53(1)(e)(ii)] in respect of “any amount unpaid followingthe enforcement of security interest” – Amounts due to thegovernment (i.e., payable into the Consolidated Fund of India orConsolidated Fund of a State) are ranked in the same manner asthose of secured creditors who do not relinquish their security interest[s.53(1)(e)(ii)]– Aforesaid rationale discussed.Electricity Act, 2003 – ss.50, 56, 181(2)(x) – Uttar PradeshElectricity Supply Code, 2005 – Clause 4.3 (f) (iv), Clause 6.15 –Recovery mechanism under– Discussed– Uttar Pradesh GovernmentElectrical Undertakings (Dues Recovery) Act, 1958.Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 – s.53(1)(f) –Constitution of India – Article 265 – “government dues” – Held:Dues payable or requiring to be credited to the Treasury, such astax, tariffs, etc. which broadly fall within the ambit of Article 265are ‘government dues’ and therefore covered by s.53(1)(f) – Whereas,dues payable to statutory corporations which do not fall within thedescription “amounts due to the central or state government” forinstance amounts payable to corporations created by statutes whichhave distinct juristic entity but whose dues do not constitutegovernment dues payable or those payable into the respectiveConsolidated Funds stand on a different footing.Companies Act, 2013 – ss.77, 78, 3(31) – Plea of the liquidatorthat without registration of charge u/s.77, the same wasunenforceable under liquidation proceedings – Held: s.78 enactsthat when a company whose property is subject to charge, fails toregister it, the charge holder (or the person entitled to the chargeover the company’s assets) can seek its registration – s.3(31) defines“security interest” in the widest terms – Liquidator cannot urge this aspect at this stage, because of the concurrent findings of the NCLTand the NCLAT that PVVNL is a secured creditor – Further, on facts,it is not appropriate to rule on the submissions of the liquidator visà-vis the fact of non-registration of charges u/s.77.Interpretation of Statutes –Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code,2016 – Gujarat Value Added Tax Act, 2003–Held: When anenactment uses two different expressions, they cannot be construedas having the same meaning – Reliance on Rainbow Papers case isof no avail to the appellant and that judgment is to be confined toits own facts.",

Ninan v. Kerala State ElectricityBoard, Supreme Court examined such circumstances and held thatthe creation of a charge need not necessarily be based on an expressprovision of the 2003 Act or plenary legislation, but could be createdby properly framed regulations authorized under the parent statute– Thus, in the present case, PVVNL rightly argued that by virtue ofClause 4.3(f)(iv) of the Supply Code, read with the stipulations inthe agreement between the parties, a charge was created on theassets of the corporate debtor – Order of the NCLT also revealsthat this position was accepted – This is evident from the order ofthe NCLAT which clarified that PVVNL also came under thedefinition of ‘secured operational creditor’ as per law – This findingwas affirmed by the impugned order – Therefore, the conclusionthat PVVNL is a secured creditor cannot be disputed – Electricity.Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 – ss.52, 53(1)(e), (f)– Government debts, operational debts vis-à-vis dues owed to unsecured financial creditors–Rationale for placing securedcreditors who relinquish their security, higher in priority– Held:The priority of claims, indicated in the hierarchy of preferences,under the waterfall mechanism accords government debts [clause(e)] and operational debts [clause (f)] lower priority than duesowed to unsecured financial creditors – Further, debts owed to asecured creditor, whenever such secured creditor “has relinquishedsecurity in the manner set out in s. 52” receive a fairly high priority(immediately after insolvency resolution process costs) – When thesecured creditor does not relinquish security, the priority of claim islower [s.53(1)(e)(ii)] in respect of “any amount unpaid followingthe enforcement of security interest” – Amounts due to thegovernment (i.e., payable into the Consolidated Fund of India orConsolidated Fund of a State) are ranked in the same manner asthose of secured creditors who do not relinquish their security interest[s.53(1)(e)(ii)]– Aforesaid rationale discussed.Electricity Act, 2003 – ss.50, 56, 181(2)(x) – Uttar PradeshElectricity Supply Code, 2005 – Clause 4.3 (f) (iv), Clause 6.15 –Recovery mechanism under– Discussed– Uttar Pradesh GovernmentElectrical Undertakings (Dues Recovery) Act, 1958.Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 – s.53(1)(f) –Constitution of India – Article 265 – “government dues” – Held:Dues payable or requiring to be credited to the Treasury, such astax, tariffs, etc. which broadly fall within the ambit of Article 265are ‘government dues’ and therefore covered by s.53(1)(f) – Whereas,dues payable to statutory corporations which do not fall within thedescription “amounts due to the central or state government” forinstance amounts payable to corporations created by statutes whichhave distinct juristic entity but whose dues do not constitutegovernment dues payable or those payable into the respectiveConsolidated Funds stand on a different footing.Companies Act, 2013 – ss.77, 78, 3(31) – Plea of the liquidatorthat without registration of charge u/s.77, the same wasunenforceable under liquidation proceedings – Held: s.78 enactsthat when a company whose property is subject to charge, fails toregister it, the charge holder (or the person entitled to the chargeover the company’s assets) can seek its registration – s.3(31) defines“security interest” in the widest terms – Liquidator cannot urge this aspect at this stage, because of the concurrent findings of the NCLTand the NCLAT that PVVNL is a secured creditor – Further, on facts,it is not appropriate to rule on the submissions of the liquidator visà-vis the fact of non-registration of charges u/s.77.Interpretation of Statutes –Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code,2016 – Gujarat Value Added Tax Act, 2003–Held: When anenactment uses two different expressions, they cannot be construedas having the same meaning – Reliance on Rainbow Papers case isof no avail to the appellant and that judgment is to be confined toits own facts.",

Ninan v. Kerala State ElectricityBoard, Supreme Court examined such circumstances and held thatthe creation of a charge need not necessarily be based on an expressprovision of the 2003 Act or plenary legislation, but could be createdby properly framed regulations authorized under the parent statute– Thus, in the present case, PVVNL rightly argued that by virtue ofClause 4.3(f)(iv) of the Supply Code, read with the stipulations inthe agreement between the parties, a charge was created on theassets of the corporate debtor – Order of the NCLT also revealsthat this position was accepted – This is evident from the order ofthe NCLAT which clarified that PVVNL also came under thedefinition of ‘secured operational creditor’ as per law – This findingwas affirmed by the impugned order – Therefore, the conclusionthat PVVNL is a secured creditor cannot be disputed – Electricity.Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 – ss.52, 53(1)(e), (f)– Government debts, operational debts vis-à-vis dues owed to unsecured financial creditors–Rationale for placing securedcreditors who relinquish their security, higher in priority– Held:The priority of claims, indicated in the hierarchy of preferences,under the waterfall mechanism accords government debts [clause(e)] and operational debts [clause (f)] lower priority than duesowed to unsecured financial creditors – Further, debts owed to asecured creditor, whenever such secured creditor “has relinquishedsecurity in the manner set out in s. 52” receive a fairly high priority(immediately after insolvency resolution process costs) – When thesecured creditor does not relinquish security, the priority of claim islower [s.53(1)(e)(ii)] in respect of “any amount unpaid followingthe enforcement of security interest” – Amounts due to thegovernment (i.e., payable into the Consolidated Fund of India orConsolidated Fund of a State) are ranked in the same manner asthose of secured creditors who do not relinquish their security interest[s.53(1)(e)(ii)]– Aforesaid rationale discussed.Electricity Act, 2003 – ss.50, 56, 181(2)(x) – Uttar PradeshElectricity Supply Code, 2005 – Clause 4.3 (f) (iv), Clause 6.15 –Recovery mechanism under– Discussed– Uttar Pradesh GovernmentElectrical Undertakings (Dues Recovery) Act, 1958.Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 – s.53(1)(f) –Constitution of India – Article 265 – “government dues” – Held:Dues payable or requiring to be credited to the Treasury, such astax, tariffs, etc. which broadly fall within the ambit of Article 265are ‘government dues’ and therefore covered by s.53(1)(f) – Whereas,dues payable to statutory corporations which do not fall within thedescription “amounts due to the central or state government” forinstance amounts payable to corporations created by statutes whichhave distinct juristic entity but whose dues do not constitutegovernment dues payable or those payable into the respectiveConsolidated Funds stand on a different footing.Companies Act, 2013 – ss.77, 78, 3(31) – Plea of the liquidatorthat without registration of charge u/s.77, the same wasunenforceable under liquidation proceedings – Held: s.78 enactsthat when a company whose property is subject to charge, fails toregister it, the charge holder (or the person entitled to the chargeover the company’s assets) can seek its registration – s.3(31) defines“security interest” in the widest terms – Liquidator cannot urge this aspect at this stage, because of the concurrent findings of the NCLTand the NCLAT that PVVNL is a secured creditor – Further, on facts,it is not appropriate to rule on the submissions of the liquidator visà-vis the fact of non-registration of charges u/s.77.Interpretation of Statutes –Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code,2016 – Gujarat Value Added Tax Act, 2003–Held: When anenactment uses two different expressions, they cannot be construedas having the same meaning – Reliance on Rainbow Papers case isof no avail to the appellant and that judgment is to be confined toits own facts.",
