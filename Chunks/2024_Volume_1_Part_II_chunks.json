        "HeadNote": " Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 – s.197 – Sanction under – Appellant-complainant lodged an FIR alleging that respondent no.2 and another were irregularly creating documents of property in the name of dead person despite knowing the fact those were fake documents – The High Court observed that respondent no.2 was a public servant – The offence complained against him, as per prosecution, was committed while discharging his duties as a public servant – Sanction sought by the investigating officer was denied – Consequently, the High Court held that since sanction was refused, prosecution for criminal offence against public servant cannot continue – Propriety: Held: It is settled that s.197 Cr.P.C. does not extend its protective cover to every act or omission of a public servant while in service – It is restricted to only those acts or omissions which are done by public servants in the discharge of official duties – The  question whether respondent No.2 was involved in fabricating official documents by misusing his official position as a public servant is a matter of trial – Certainly, a view can be taken that manufacturing of such documents or fabrication of records cannot be a part of the official duty of a public servant – If that be the position, the High Court was not justified in quashing the complaint as well as the chargesheet in its entirety, more so when there are two other accused persons besides respondent No.2 – There is another aspect of the matter – Respondent No.2 had unsuccessfully challenged the complaint in an earlier proceeding u/s. 482 Cr.P.C. – Though liberty was granted by the High Court to respondent No.2 to challenge any adverse report if filed subsequent to the lodging of the complaint, instead of confining the challenge to the chargesheet, respondent No.2 also assailed the complaint as well which he could not have done – The High Court erred in quashing the complaint as well as the chargesheet in its entirety. [Paras 23, 25] Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 – s. 197 – Ambit, scope and effect of: Held: The object of such sanction for prosecution is to protect a public servant discharging official duties and functions from undue harassment by initiation of frivolous criminal proceedings.

If an enquiry, inquiry or investigation is intended in respect of a public servant on the allegation of commission of offence under the 1988 Act after s.17A thereof becomes operational, which is relatable to any recommendation made or decision taken, at least prima facie, in discharge of his official duty, previous approval of the authority postulated in sub- section (a) or (b) or (c) of s.17A shall have to be obtained – In absence of such previous approval, the action initiated under the 1988 Act shall be illegal – In the present case, original FIR was registered on 09.12.2021 and the appellant was implicated on 08.09.2023 – There is no evidence of any substantive enquiry, inquiry, or investigation made against him prior to coming into operation of s.17A – Appellant cannot be proceeded against for offences under the 1988 Act as no previous approval of the appropriate authority was obtained – Per Bela M. Trivedi, J. s.17A having been introduced as a part of larger legislative scheme, and the other offences under the PC Act having been redefined or newly inserted by way of Amendment Act, 2018, is required to be treated as substantive and not merely procedural in nature – Such a substantive amendment could not be made applicable retrospectively to the offences like ss.13(1)(c) and 13(1)(d) which have been deleted under the Amendment Act, 2018 – Intention of the legislature was to make s.17A applicable only to the new offences as amended by Amendment Act, 2018 and not to the offences which existed prior to the coming into force of the Amendment Act 2018 – In the instant case, the offences u/s.13(1)(c) and (d) were in force when the same were allegedly committed by the appellant – Deletion of the said provisions and the substitution of the new offence u/s.13 by the Amendment Act, 2018 would not affect the right of the investigating agency to investigate nor would vitiate or invalidate any proceedings initiated against the appellant – In view of difference of opinion, matter referred to the Hon’ble the Chief Justice of India for constitution of a Larger Bench. [Paras 12, 13, 20, 34 and 15, 21, 27].  Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988 – Penal Code, 1860 – Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 – s.223 – Allegations of commission of offences against the appellant under different provisions of IPC and 1988 Act – Appellant was added as accused by filing the Accused Adding Memo – By the Amendment Act 2018, several provisions, particularly the offences described under ss.7, 8, 9, 10 and 13 in the 1988 Act were substituted with the new provisions; and several new provisions like s.17A were inserted – Appellant filed petition seeking quashing of the FIR and the consequential order of remand passed by the Special Court, dismissed by High Court – Appellant argued that if the initial action was not in consonance with law, all subsequent and consequential proceedings would fall and once offences under the PC Act were effaced from existence, the custody of the appellant pursuant to the orders passed by the Special Court was without any sanction of law: Held: Per Aniruddha Bose, J. The offences against the appellant relate to the same or similar set of transactions in relation to which the Special Judge was proceeding with the case initiated by the F.I.R. dated 09.12.2021 against the other accused persons – Sub clause (a) of the s.223, so far as charging and trying of an accused is concerned, could apply in the present case, as the non-obstante clause with which s.4, 1988 Act is couched, would not oust the principles contained in s.223 – Remand order not interfered with as the Special Judge had the jurisdiction to pass such order even if the offences under the 1988 Act could not be invoked at that stage – Lack of approval in terms of s.17A would not have rendered the entire order of remand non-est – Appellant could be proceeded against before the Special Judge for allegations of commission of offences under the IPC for which also he has been implicated – Per Bela M. Trivedi, J. Appellant having been implicated for the other offences under IPC also, the Special Court was completely within its jurisdiction to pass the remand order in view of the powers conferred upon it u/ss.4, 5 of the 1988 Act – No jurisdictional error committed by the Special Court in passing the order of remand – Impugned judgment and order passed by the High Court also does not suffer from any illegality, not interfered with.

If an enquiry, inquiry or investigation is intended in respect of a public servant on the allegation of commission of offence under the 1988 Act after s.17A thereof becomes operational, which is relatable to any recommendation made or decision taken, at least prima facie, in discharge of his official duty, previous approval of the authority postulated in sub- section (a) or (b) or (c) of s.17A shall have to be obtained – In absence of such previous approval, the action initiated under the 1988 Act shall be illegal – In the present case, original FIR was registered on 09.12.2021 and the appellant was implicated on 08.09.2023 – There is no evidence of any substantive enquiry, inquiry, or investigation made against him prior to coming into operation of s.17A – Appellant cannot be proceeded against for offences under the 1988 Act as no previous approval of the appropriate authority was obtained – Per Bela M. Trivedi, J. s.17A having been introduced as a part of larger legislative scheme, and the other offences under the PC Act having been redefined or newly inserted by way of Amendment Act, 2018, is required to be treated as substantive and not merely procedural in nature – Such a substantive amendment could not be made applicable retrospectively to the offences like ss.13(1)(c) and 13(1)(d) which have been deleted under the Amendment Act, 2018 – Intention of the legislature was to make s.17A applicable only to the new offences as amended by Amendment Act, 2018 and not to the offences which existed prior to the coming into force of the Amendment Act 2018 – In the instant case, the offences u/s.13(1)(c) and (d) were in force when the same were allegedly committed by the appellant – Deletion of the said provisions and the substitution of the new offence u/s.13 by the Amendment Act, 2018 would not affect the right of the investigating agency to investigate nor would vitiate or invalidate any proceedings initiated against the appellant – In view of difference of opinion, matter referred to the Hon’ble the Chief Justice of India for constitution of a Larger Bench. [Paras 12, 13, 20, 34 and 15, 21, 27].  Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988 – Penal Code, 1860 – Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 – s.223 – Allegations of commission of offences against the appellant under different provisions of IPC and 1988 Act – Appellant was added as accused by filing the Accused Adding Memo – By the Amendment Act 2018, several provisions, particularly the offences described under ss.7, 8, 9, 10 and 13 in the 1988 Act were substituted with the new provisions; and several new provisions like s.17A were inserted – Appellant filed petition seeking quashing of the FIR and the consequential order of remand passed by the Special Court, dismissed by High Court – Appellant argued that if the initial action was not in consonance with law, all subsequent and consequential proceedings would fall and once offences under the PC Act were effaced from existence, the custody of the appellant pursuant to the orders passed by the Special Court was without any sanction of law: Held: Per Aniruddha Bose, J. The offences against the appellant relate to the same or similar set of transactions in relation to which the Special Judge was proceeding with the case initiated by the F.I.R. dated 09.12.2021 against the other accused persons – Sub clause (a) of the s.223, so far as charging and trying of an accused is concerned, could apply in the present case, as the non-obstante clause with which s.4, 1988 Act is couched, would not oust the principles contained in s.223 – Remand order not interfered with as the Special Judge had the jurisdiction to pass such order even if the offences under the 1988 Act could not be invoked at that stage – Lack of approval in terms of s.17A would not have rendered the entire order of remand non-est – Appellant could be proceeded against before the Special Judge for allegations of commission of offences under the IPC for which also he has been implicated – Per Bela M. Trivedi, J. Appellant having been implicated for the other offences under IPC also, the Special Court was completely within its jurisdiction to pass the remand order in view of the powers conferred upon it u/ss.4, 5 of the 1988 Act – No jurisdictional error committed by the Special Court in passing the order of remand – Impugned judgment and order passed by the High Court also does not suffer from any illegality, not interfered with.

If an enquiry, inquiry or investigation is intended in respect of a public servant on the allegation of commission of offence under the 1988 Act after s.17A thereof becomes operational, which is relatable to any recommendation made or decision taken, at least prima facie, in discharge of his official duty, previous approval of the authority postulated in sub- section (a) or (b) or (c) of s.17A shall have to be obtained – In absence of such previous approval, the action initiated under the 1988 Act shall be illegal – In the present case, original FIR was registered on 09.12.2021 and the appellant was implicated on 08.09.2023 – There is no evidence of any substantive enquiry, inquiry, or investigation made against him prior to coming into operation of s.17A – Appellant cannot be proceeded against for offences under the 1988 Act as no previous approval of the appropriate authority was obtained – Per Bela M. Trivedi, J. s.17A having been introduced as a part of larger legislative scheme, and the other offences under the PC Act having been redefined or newly inserted by way of Amendment Act, 2018, is required to be treated as substantive and not merely procedural in nature – Such a substantive amendment could not be made applicable retrospectively to the offences like ss.13(1)(c) and 13(1)(d) which have been deleted under the Amendment Act, 2018 – Intention of the legislature was to make s.17A applicable only to the new offences as amended by Amendment Act, 2018 and not to the offences which existed prior to the coming into force of the Amendment Act 2018 – In the instant case, the offences u/s.13(1)(c) and (d) were in force when the same were allegedly committed by the appellant – Deletion of the said provisions and the substitution of the new offence u/s.13 by the Amendment Act, 2018 would not affect the right of the investigating agency to investigate nor would vitiate or invalidate any proceedings initiated against the appellant – In view of difference of opinion, matter referred to the Hon’ble the Chief Justice of India for constitution of a Larger Bench. [Paras 12, 13, 20, 34 and 15, 21, 27].  Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988 – Penal Code, 1860 – Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 – s.223 – Allegations of commission of offences against the appellant under different provisions of IPC and 1988 Act – Appellant was added as accused by filing the Accused Adding Memo – By the Amendment Act 2018, several provisions, particularly the offences described under ss.7, 8, 9, 10 and 13 in the 1988 Act were substituted with the new provisions; and several new provisions like s.17A were inserted – Appellant filed petition seeking quashing of the FIR and the consequential order of remand passed by the Special Court, dismissed by High Court – Appellant argued that if the initial action was not in consonance with law, all subsequent and consequential proceedings would fall and once offences under the PC Act were effaced from existence, the custody of the appellant pursuant to the orders passed by the Special Court was without any sanction of law: Held: Per Aniruddha Bose, J. The offences against the appellant relate to the same or similar set of transactions in relation to which the Special Judge was proceeding with the case initiated by the F.I.R. dated 09.12.2021 against the other accused persons – Sub clause (a) of the s.223, so far as charging and trying of an accused is concerned, could apply in the present case, as the non-obstante clause with which s.4, 1988 Act is couched, would not oust the principles contained in s.223 – Remand order not interfered with as the Special Judge had the jurisdiction to pass such order even if the offences under the 1988 Act could not be invoked at that stage – Lack of approval in terms of s.17A would not have rendered the entire order of remand non-est – Appellant could be proceeded against before the Special Judge for allegations of commission of offences under the IPC for which also he has been implicated – Per Bela M. Trivedi, J. Appellant having been implicated for the other offences under IPC also, the Special Court was completely within its jurisdiction to pass the remand order in view of the powers conferred upon it u/ss.4, 5 of the 1988 Act – No jurisdictional error committed by the Special Court in passing the order of remand – Impugned judgment and order passed by the High Court also does not suffer from any illegality, not interfered with.

If an enquiry, inquiry or investigation is intended in respect of a public servant on the allegation of commission of offence under the 1988 Act after s.17A thereof becomes operational, which is relatable to any recommendation made or decision taken, at least prima facie, in discharge of his official duty, previous approval of the authority postulated in sub- section (a) or (b) or (c) of s.17A shall have to be obtained – In absence of such previous approval, the action initiated under the 1988 Act shall be illegal – In the present case, original FIR was registered on 09.12.2021 and the appellant was implicated on 08.09.2023 – There is no evidence of any substantive enquiry, inquiry, or investigation made against him prior to coming into operation of s.17A – Appellant cannot be proceeded against for offences under the 1988 Act as no previous approval of the appropriate authority was obtained – Per Bela M. Trivedi, J. s.17A having been introduced as a part of larger legislative scheme, and the other offences under the PC Act having been redefined or newly inserted by way of Amendment Act, 2018, is required to be treated as substantive and not merely procedural in nature – Such a substantive amendment could not be made applicable retrospectively to the offences like ss.13(1)(c) and 13(1)(d) which have been deleted under the Amendment Act, 2018 – Intention of the legislature was to make s.17A applicable only to the new offences as amended by Amendment Act, 2018 and not to the offences which existed prior to the coming into force of the Amendment Act 2018 – In the instant case, the offences u/s.13(1)(c) and (d) were in force when the same were allegedly committed by the appellant – Deletion of the said provisions and the substitution of the new offence u/s.13 by the Amendment Act, 2018 would not affect the right of the investigating agency to investigate nor would vitiate or invalidate any proceedings initiated against the appellant – In view of difference of opinion, matter referred to the Hon’ble the Chief Justice of India for constitution of a Larger Bench. [Paras 12, 13, 20, 34 and 15, 21, 27].  Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988 – Penal Code, 1860 – Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 – s.223 – Allegations of commission of offences against the appellant under different provisions of IPC and 1988 Act – Appellant was added as accused by filing the Accused Adding Memo – By the Amendment Act 2018, several provisions, particularly the offences described under ss.7, 8, 9, 10 and 13 in the 1988 Act were substituted with the new provisions; and several new provisions like s.17A were inserted – Appellant filed petition seeking quashing of the FIR and the consequential order of remand passed by the Special Court, dismissed by High Court – Appellant argued that if the initial action was not in consonance with law, all subsequent and consequential proceedings would fall and once offences under the PC Act were effaced from existence, the custody of the appellant pursuant to the orders passed by the Special Court was without any sanction of law: Held: Per Aniruddha Bose, J. The offences against the appellant relate to the same or similar set of transactions in relation to which the Special Judge was proceeding with the case initiated by the F.I.R. dated 09.12.2021 against the other accused persons – Sub clause (a) of the s.223, so far as charging and trying of an accused is concerned, could apply in the present case, as the non-obstante clause with which s.4, 1988 Act is couched, would not oust the principles contained in s.223 – Remand order not interfered with as the Special Judge had the jurisdiction to pass such order even if the offences under the 1988 Act could not be invoked at that stage – Lack of approval in terms of s.17A would not have rendered the entire order of remand non-est – Appellant could be proceeded against before the Special Judge for allegations of commission of offences under the IPC for which also he has been implicated – Per Bela M. Trivedi, J. Appellant having been implicated for the other offences under IPC also, the Special Court was completely within its jurisdiction to pass the remand order in view of the powers conferred upon it u/ss.4, 5 of the 1988 Act – No jurisdictional error committed by the Special Court in passing the order of remand – Impugned judgment and order passed by the High Court also does not suffer from any illegality, not interfered with.

        "HeadNote": " Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 – s. 34 – The award passed by the Arbitrator was modified by the Civil Judge and the Respondents were directed to pay Rs.3,71,564 (25% of tender amount) along with Rs.10,000/- as costs towards the arbitration @ 9% interest – Propriety: Held: It is settled that any court u/s. 34 would have no jurisdiction to modify the arbitral award, which at best, given the same to be in conflict with the grounds specified u/s. 34 would be wholly unsustainable in law – Also, the Arbitrator’s view, generally is considered to be binding upon the parties unless it is set aside on certain specified grounds – In the instant case, award passed on 18.02.2003 was prior to the amendment brought in Section 34 by virtue of the Arbitration and Conciliation (Amendment) Act, 2015 – Prior to the Amending Act, it was open for the Court to examine the award as to whether it was in conflict with, (a) public policy of India; (b) induced or affected by fraud; (c) corruption; and (d) any violation of the provisions of s.75 and s.81 of the Act – In the given situation, the only provision under which the award could have been assailed was for it to have been in conflict with the public policy of India – A perusal of the judgment and order of the Civil Judge does not reflect fidelity to the text of the statute – Nowhere does it stand explained, as to, under which ground(s) mentioned u/s. 34 of the Act, did the Court find sufficient reason to intervene – In fact, quite opposite thereto, the Court undertook a re-appreciation of the matter, and upon its own view of the evidence, modified the order – None of the reasons recorded allude to the award being contrary to the public policy of India, which would enable the court to look into the merits of the award – The award passed by the Arbitrator in which he has not only referred to and considered the materials on record in their entirety but also, after due application of mind, assigned reasons for arriving at this conclusion, either rejecting, accepting or reducing the claim set out by the Claimant Appellant – The view taken by the Arbitrator is a plausible view and could not have been substituted for its own by the Court – Thus, the modification of the arbitral award by the Civil Judge does not stand scrutiny, and must be set aside. [Paras 28, 29, 30, 31, 33] Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 – s. 37 – The High Court upheld the modification of the arbitral award by the Civil Judge u/s. 37 of the Act – Propriety: Held: The Single Judge of the High Court, similar to the Civil Judge u/s. 34, appears to have not concerned themselves with the contours of s.37 of the Act – The Court u/s. 37 had only three options:- (a) Confirming the award of the Arbitrator; (b) Setting aside the award as modified u/s. 34; and (c) Rejecting the application(s) u/s. 34 and 37 – The single Judge has examined the reasoning adopted by the Arbitrator in respect of certain claims (claims 3 and 7, particularly) and held that allowing a claim for escalation of cost, was without satisfactory material having been placed on record and is “perverse and contrary to the public policy” – However, it appears that such a holding on part of the Judge is without giving reasons therefor – It has not been discussed as to what the evidence was before the single Judge to arrive at such conclusion – In the absence of compliance with the well laid out parameters and contours of both s.34 and s.37 of the Act, the impugned judgments are set aside – Consequently, the award dated 18.02.2003 of the Arbitrator is restored.

[Paras 28, 29, 30, 31, 33] Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 – s. 37 – The High Court upheld the modification of the arbitral award by the Civil Judge u/s. 37 of the Act – Propriety: Held: The Single Judge of the High Court, similar to the Civil Judge u/s. 34, appears to have not concerned themselves with the contours of s.37 of the Act – The Court u/s. 37 had only three options:- (a) Confirming the award of the Arbitrator; (b) Setting aside the award as modified u/s. 34; and (c) Rejecting the application(s) u/s. 34 and 37 – The single Judge has examined the reasoning adopted by the Arbitrator in respect of certain claims (claims 3 and 7, particularly) and held that allowing a claim for escalation of cost, was without satisfactory material having been placed on record and is “perverse and contrary to the public policy” – However, it appears that such a holding on part of the Judge is without giving reasons therefor – It has not been discussed as to what the evidence was before the single Judge to arrive at such conclusion – In the absence of compliance with the well laid out parameters and contours of both s.34 and s.37 of the Act, the impugned judgments are set aside – Consequently, the award dated 18.02.2003 of the Arbitrator is restored.

[Paras 28, 29, 30, 31, 33] Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 – s. 37 – The High Court upheld the modification of the arbitral award by the Civil Judge u/s. 37 of the Act – Propriety: Held: The Single Judge of the High Court, similar to the Civil Judge u/s. 34, appears to have not concerned themselves with the contours of s.37 of the Act – The Court u/s. 37 had only three options:- (a) Confirming the award of the Arbitrator; (b) Setting aside the award as modified u/s. 34; and (c) Rejecting the application(s) u/s. 34 and 37 – The single Judge has examined the reasoning adopted by the Arbitrator in respect of certain claims (claims 3 and 7, particularly) and held that allowing a claim for escalation of cost, was without satisfactory material having been placed on record and is “perverse and contrary to the public policy” – However, it appears that such a holding on part of the Judge is without giving reasons therefor – It has not been discussed as to what the evidence was before the single Judge to arrive at such conclusion – In the absence of compliance with the well laid out parameters and contours of both s.34 and s.37 of the Act, the impugned judgments are set aside – Consequently, the award dated 18.02.2003 of the Arbitrator is restored.

VIII and s.47 – Respondents 1 to 3 had filed an objection u/s. 47 of the CPC in an execution application filed before the Executing Court by the appellants-plaintiffs – It was urged, based on the case pleaded therein, that the decree put to execution was inexecutable – The Executing Court allowed the objections and the execution application was dismissed – However, the Revisional Court directed the Executing Court to proceed with the execution of decree – Respondents 1 to 3 filed application u/Art. 227 against the revisional order – The High Court quashed the order passed by the Revisional Court and relegated the parties to the remedy of having their rights, in respect of the suit property, adjudicated by the appropriate forum – Propriety: Held: Appellants-plaintiffs had instituted a civil suit against the three defendants-K (defendant no.1), K’s son S (defendant no.2) and R (defendant no.3) – K filed his written statement on 05.12.1990 and inter-alia contended that suit was barred by s.331 of the Uttar Pradesh Zamindari Abolition and Land Reforms Act, 1950 – No written statements was filed by other two defendants – Appellants moved an application u/rr. 5, 10 of Or.VIII, CPC for pronouncement of judgment against S (defendant no.2) and the same was allowed – K passed away and the suit against him was dismissed as abated – In the instant case, the trial Court is presumed to be aware of the fact that the written statement of K was on record or else it would not have fixed the next date for settling ‘issues’ – In a situation where maintainability of the suit was in question and despite S not having filed his written statement, it was not a case where the Trial Court could simply pronounce judgment without even recording a satisfaction that it had the jurisdiction to try the suit and adjudicate the contentious issue(s), not to speak of pronouncing its verdict against S without assigning a single reason by treating the averments in the plaint to be admitted – The High Court rightly observed that even on pronouncement of judgment against S, the lis remained alive as against K and decision on the objection as to maintainability could have resulted in a contrary decision – In the matter at hand, the filing of the written statement by K denying the averments made in the plaint warranted that the appellants’ claims be proved by evidence, oral and/or documentary, instead of decreeing the suit against one of the defendants in a most slipshod manner – As far as the objection available to the respondents 1 to 3 u/s. 47 of CPC is concerned, it is the settled position of law that the powers of an executing court, though narrower than an appellate or revisional court, can be exercised to dismiss an execution application if the decree put to execution is unmistakably found to suffer from an inherent lack of jurisdiction of the court that made the same rendering it a nullity in the eyes of law – The Executing Court and the High Court were right in holding that the objection raised by the respondents 1 to 3 to the executability of the decree was well-founded – Further, the decision rendered by a court on the merits of a controversy in favour of the plaintiff without first adjudicating on its competence to decide such controversy would amount to a decision being rendered on an illegal and erroneous assumption of jurisdiction and, thus, be assailable as lacking in inherent jurisdiction and be treated as a nullity in the eyes of law; as a logical corollary, the order dated 05.08.1991 is held to be ab initio void and the decree drawn up based thereon is inexecutable – That apart, the order dated 05.08.1991 does not reveal any adjudication leading to determination of the rights of the parties in relation to any of the matters in controversy in the suit and therefore, the decree since drawn up is not a formal expression of an adjudication/determination since there has been no adjudication/ determination so as to conform to the requirements of a decree within the meaning of section 2(2) of CPC – Therefore, the trial Court had no authority to decree the suit against S in exercise of its power u/r.10 of Or.VIII, CPC – No reason to interfere with the judgment of the High Court.

VIII – When the defendant defaults in filing written statement – What is required by the plaintiff:  Held: In a given case, the defendant defaults in filing written statement and the first alternative were the only course to be adopted (pronouncing judgment against defendant), it would tantamount to a plaintiff being altogether relieved of its obligation to prove his case to the satisfaction of the court – Generally, in order to be entitled to a judgment in his favour, what is required of a plaintiff is to prove his pleaded case by adducing evidence – Rule 10, in fact, has to be read together with Rule 5 of Order VIII and the position seems to be clear that a trial court, at its discretion, may require any fact, treated as admitted, to be so proved otherwise than by such admission – Since facts are required to be pleaded in a plaint and not the evidence, which can be adduced in course of examination of witnesses, mere failure or neglect of a defendant to file a written statement controverting the pleaded facts in the plaint, in all cases, may not entitle him to a judgment in his favour unless by adducing evidence he proves his case/claim. [Para 18]. Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 – Jurisdiction – Essence of: Held: The essence really is that a court must not only have the jurisdiction in respect of the subject matter of dispute for the purpose of entertaining and trying the claim but also the jurisdiction to grant relief that is sought for – Once it is conceded that the jurisdiction on both counts is available, it is immaterial if jurisdiction is exercised erroneously – An erroneous decision cannot be labelled as having been passed ‘without jurisdiction’ – It is, therefore, imperative that the distinction between a decision lacking in inherent jurisdiction and a decision which suffers from an error committed in the exercise of jurisdiction is borne in mind. [Para 35]. Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 – Jurisdiction – Determination of question of jurisdiction by civil Court: Held: Jurisdiction is the entitlement of the civil court to embark upon an enquiry as to whether the cause has been brought before it by the plaintiff in a manner prescribed by law and also whether a good case for grant of relief claimed been set up by him – As and when such entitlement is established, any subsequent error till delivery of judgment could be regarded as an error within the jurisdiction – The enquiry as to whether the civil court is entitled to entertain and try a suit has to be made by it keeping in mind the provision in section 9, CPC and the relevant enactment which, according to the objector, bars a suit – The question of jurisdiction has to be determined at the commencement and not at the conclusion of the enquiry. [Para 38]. . Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 – Jurisdiction – Question of jurisdiction at the stage when a Court considers the question of grant of interim relief: Held: Where interim relief is claimed in a suit before a civil court and the party to be affected by grant of such relief, or any other party to the suit, raises a point of maintainability thereof or that it is barred by law and also contends on that basis that interim relief should not to be granted, grant of relief in whatever form, if at all, ought to be preceded by formation and recording of at least a prima facie satisfaction that the suit is maintainable or that it is not barred by law – It would be inappropriate for a court to abstain from recording its prima facie satisfaction on the question of maintainability, yet, proceed to grant protection pro tem on the assumption that the question of maintainability has to be decided as a preliminary issue under Rule 2 of Order XIV, CPC – That could amount to an improper exercise of power – If the court is of the opinion at the stage of hearing the application for interim relief that the suit is barred by law or is otherwise not maintainable, it cannot dismiss it without framing a preliminary issue after the written statement is filed but can most certainly assign such opinion for refusing interim relief – However, if an extraordinary situation arises where it could take time to decide the point of maintainability of the suit and non-grant of protection pro tem pending such decision could lead to irreversible consequences, the court may proceed to make an appropriate order in the manner justifying the course of action it adopts – In other words, such an order may be passed, if at all required, to avoid irreparable harm or injury or undue hardship to the party claiming the relief and/or to ensure that the proceedings are not rendered infructuous by reason of non-interference by the court. [Para 39].  Judgment/Order – Cardinal principle of: Held: It is one of the cardinal principles of the justice delivery system that any verdict of a competent judicial forum in the form of a judgment/order, that determines the rights and liabilities of the parties to the proceedings, must inform the parties what is the outcome and why one party has succeeded and not the other - the ‘why’ constituting the reasons and ‘what’ the conclusion – Apart from anything else, insistence of the requirement for the reason(s) to support the conclusion guarantees application of mind by the adjudicator to the materials before it as well as provides an avenue to the unsuccessful party to test the reasons before a higher court – All civil courts in the country have to regulate their judicial work in accordance with the terms of the provisions of the CPC – Any egregious breach or violation of such provisions, would be ultra vires.

VIII and s.47 – Respondents 1 to 3 had filed an objection u/s. 47 of the CPC in an execution application filed before the Executing Court by the appellants-plaintiffs – It was urged, based on the case pleaded therein, that the decree put to execution was inexecutable – The Executing Court allowed the objections and the execution application was dismissed – However, the Revisional Court directed the Executing Court to proceed with the execution of decree – Respondents 1 to 3 filed application u/Art. 227 against the revisional order – The High Court quashed the order passed by the Revisional Court and relegated the parties to the remedy of having their rights, in respect of the suit property, adjudicated by the appropriate forum – Propriety: Held: Appellants-plaintiffs had instituted a civil suit against the three defendants-K (defendant no.1), K’s son S (defendant no.2) and R (defendant no.3) – K filed his written statement on 05.12.1990 and inter-alia contended that suit was barred by s.331 of the Uttar Pradesh Zamindari Abolition and Land Reforms Act, 1950 – No written statements was filed by other two defendants – Appellants moved an application u/rr. 5, 10 of Or.VIII, CPC for pronouncement of judgment against S (defendant no.2) and the same was allowed – K passed away and the suit against him was dismissed as abated – In the instant case, the trial Court is presumed to be aware of the fact that the written statement of K was on record or else it would not have fixed the next date for settling ‘issues’ – In a situation where maintainability of the suit was in question and despite S not having filed his written statement, it was not a case where the Trial Court could simply pronounce judgment without even recording a satisfaction that it had the jurisdiction to try the suit and adjudicate the contentious issue(s), not to speak of pronouncing its verdict against S without assigning a single reason by treating the averments in the plaint to be admitted – The High Court rightly observed that even on pronouncement of judgment against S, the lis remained alive as against K and decision on the objection as to maintainability could have resulted in a contrary decision – In the matter at hand, the filing of the written statement by K denying the averments made in the plaint warranted that the appellants’ claims be proved by evidence, oral and/or documentary, instead of decreeing the suit against one of the defendants in a most slipshod manner – As far as the objection available to the respondents 1 to 3 u/s. 47 of CPC is concerned, it is the settled position of law that the powers of an executing court, though narrower than an appellate or revisional court, can be exercised to dismiss an execution application if the decree put to execution is unmistakably found to suffer from an inherent lack of jurisdiction of the court that made the same rendering it a nullity in the eyes of law – The Executing Court and the High Court were right in holding that the objection raised by the respondents 1 to 3 to the executability of the decree was well-founded – Further, the decision rendered by a court on the merits of a controversy in favour of the plaintiff without first adjudicating on its competence to decide such controversy would amount to a decision being rendered on an illegal and erroneous assumption of jurisdiction and, thus, be assailable as lacking in inherent jurisdiction and be treated as a nullity in the eyes of law; as a logical corollary, the order dated 05.08.1991 is held to be ab initio void and the decree drawn up based thereon is inexecutable – That apart, the order dated 05.08.1991 does not reveal any adjudication leading to determination of the rights of the parties in relation to any of the matters in controversy in the suit and therefore, the decree since drawn up is not a formal expression of an adjudication/determination since there has been no adjudication/ determination so as to conform to the requirements of a decree within the meaning of section 2(2) of CPC – Therefore, the trial Court had no authority to decree the suit against S in exercise of its power u/r.10 of Or.VIII, CPC – No reason to interfere with the judgment of the High Court. [Paras 6,20,29,41,50,52].  Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 – r.10 of Or. VIII – Scope and extent of power – Discussed. [Paras 13, 14, 15, 16, 17] Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 – rr. 5, 10 of Or. VIII – When the defendant defaults in filing written statement – What is required by the plaintiff:  Held: In a given case, the defendant defaults in filing written statement and the first alternative were the only course to be adopted (pronouncing judgment against defendant), it would tantamount to a plaintiff being altogether relieved of its obligation to prove his case to the satisfaction of the court – Generally, in order to be entitled to a judgment in his favour, what is required of a plaintiff is to prove his pleaded case by adducing evidence – Rule 10, in fact, has to be read together with Rule 5 of Order VIII and the position seems to be clear that a trial court, at its discretion, may require any fact, treated as admitted, to be so proved otherwise than by such admission – Since facts are required to be pleaded in a plaint and not the evidence, which can be adduced in course of examination of witnesses, mere failure or neglect of a defendant to file a written statement controverting the pleaded facts in the plaint, in all cases, may not entitle him to a judgment in his favour unless by adducing evidence he proves his case/claim. [Para 18]. Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 – Jurisdiction – Essence of: Held: The essence really is that a court must not only have the jurisdiction in respect of the subject matter of dispute for the purpose of entertaining and trying the claim but also the jurisdiction to grant relief that is sought for – Once it is conceded that the jurisdiction on both counts is available, it is immaterial if jurisdiction is exercised erroneously – An erroneous decision cannot be labelled as having been passed ‘without jurisdiction’ – It is, therefore, imperative that the distinction between a decision lacking in inherent jurisdiction and a decision which suffers from an error committed in the exercise of jurisdiction is borne in mind. [Para 35]. Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 – Jurisdiction – Determination of question of jurisdiction by civil Court: Held: Jurisdiction is the entitlement of the civil court to embark upon an enquiry as to whether the cause has been brought before it by the plaintiff in a manner prescribed by law and also whether a good case for grant of relief claimed been set up by him – As and when such entitlement is established, any subsequent error till delivery of judgment could be regarded as an error within the jurisdiction – The enquiry as to whether the civil court is entitled to entertain and try a suit has to be made by it keeping in mind the provision in section 9, CPC and the relevant enactment which, according to the objector, bars a suit – The question of jurisdiction has to be determined at the commencement and not at the conclusion of the enquiry. [Para 38]. . Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 – Jurisdiction – Question of jurisdiction at the stage when a Court considers the question of grant of interim relief: Held: Where interim relief is claimed in a suit before a civil court and the party to be affected by grant of such relief, or any other party to the suit, raises a point of maintainability thereof or that it is barred by law and also contends on that basis that interim relief should not to be granted, grant of relief in whatever form, if at all, ought to be preceded by formation and recording of at least a prima facie satisfaction that the suit is maintainable or that it is not barred by law – It would be inappropriate for a court to abstain from recording its prima facie satisfaction on the question of maintainability, yet, proceed to grant protection pro tem on the assumption that the question of maintainability has to be decided as a preliminary issue under Rule 2 of Order XIV, CPC – That could amount to an improper exercise of power – If the court is of the opinion at the stage of hearing the application for interim relief that the suit is barred by law or is otherwise not maintainable, it cannot dismiss it without framing a preliminary issue after the written statement is filed but can most certainly assign such opinion for refusing interim relief – However, if an extraordinary situation arises where it could take time to decide the point of maintainability of the suit and non-grant of protection pro tem pending such decision could lead to irreversible consequences, the court may proceed to make an appropriate order in the manner justifying the course of action it adopts – In other words, such an order may be passed, if at all required, to avoid irreparable harm or injury or undue hardship to the party claiming the relief and/or to ensure that the proceedings are not rendered infructuous by reason of non-interference by the court. [Para 39].  Judgment/Order – Cardinal principle of: Held: It is one of the cardinal principles of the justice delivery system that any verdict of a competent judicial forum in the form of a judgment/order, that determines the rights and liabilities of the parties to the proceedings, must inform the parties what is the outcome and why one party has succeeded and not the other - the ‘why’ constituting the reasons and ‘what’ the conclusion – Apart from anything else, insistence of the requirement for the reason(s) to support the conclusion guarantees application of mind by the adjudicator to the materials before it as well as provides an avenue to the unsuccessful party to test the reasons before a higher court – All civil courts in the country have to regulate their judicial work in accordance with the terms of the provisions of the CPC – Any egregious breach or violation of such provisions, would be ultra vires.

VIII and s.47 – Respondents 1 to 3 had filed an objection u/s. 47 of the CPC in an execution application filed before the Executing Court by the appellants-plaintiffs – It was urged, based on the case pleaded therein, that the decree put to execution was inexecutable – The Executing Court allowed the objections and the execution application was dismissed – However, the Revisional Court directed the Executing Court to proceed with the execution of decree – Respondents 1 to 3 filed application u/Art. 227 against the revisional order – The High Court quashed the order passed by the Revisional Court and relegated the parties to the remedy of having their rights, in respect of the suit property, adjudicated by the appropriate forum – Propriety: Held: Appellants-plaintiffs had instituted a civil suit against the three defendants-K (defendant no.1), K’s son S (defendant no.2) and R (defendant no.3) – K filed his written statement on 05.12.1990 and inter-alia contended that suit was barred by s.331 of the Uttar Pradesh Zamindari Abolition and Land Reforms Act, 1950 – No written statements was filed by other two defendants – Appellants moved an application u/rr. 5, 10 of Or.VIII, CPC for pronouncement of judgment against S (defendant no.2) and the same was allowed – K passed away and the suit against him was dismissed as abated – In the instant case, the trial Court is presumed to be aware of the fact that the written statement of K was on record or else it would not have fixed the next date for settling ‘issues’ – In a situation where maintainability of the suit was in question and despite S not having filed his written statement, it was not a case where the Trial Court could simply pronounce judgment without even recording a satisfaction that it had the jurisdiction to try the suit and adjudicate the contentious issue(s), not to speak of pronouncing its verdict against S without assigning a single reason by treating the averments in the plaint to be admitted – The High Court rightly observed that even on pronouncement of judgment against S, the lis remained alive as against K and decision on the objection as to maintainability could have resulted in a contrary decision – In the matter at hand, the filing of the written statement by K denying the averments made in the plaint warranted that the appellants’ claims be proved by evidence, oral and/or documentary, instead of decreeing the suit against one of the defendants in a most slipshod manner – As far as the objection available to the respondents 1 to 3 u/s. 47 of CPC is concerned, it is the settled position of law that the powers of an executing court, though narrower than an appellate or revisional court, can be exercised to dismiss an execution application if the decree put to execution is unmistakably found to suffer from an inherent lack of jurisdiction of the court that made the same rendering it a nullity in the eyes of law – The Executing Court and the High Court were right in holding that the objection raised by the respondents 1 to 3 to the executability of the decree was well-founded – Further, the decision rendered by a court on the merits of a controversy in favour of the plaintiff without first adjudicating on its competence to decide such controversy would amount to a decision being rendered on an illegal and erroneous assumption of jurisdiction and, thus, be assailable as lacking in inherent jurisdiction and be treated as a nullity in the eyes of law; as a logical corollary, the order dated 05.08.1991 is held to be ab initio void and the decree drawn up based thereon is inexecutable – That apart, the order dated 05.08.1991 does not reveal any adjudication leading to determination of the rights of the parties in relation to any of the matters in controversy in the suit and therefore, the decree since drawn up is not a formal expression of an adjudication/determination since there has been no adjudication/ determination so as to conform to the requirements of a decree within the meaning of section 2(2) of CPC – Therefore, the trial Court had no authority to decree the suit against S in exercise of its power u/r.10 of Or.VIII, CPC – No reason to interfere with the judgment of the High Court. [Paras 6,20,29,41,50,52].  Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 – r.10 of Or. VIII – Scope and extent of power – Discussed. [Paras 13, 14, 15, 16, 17] Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 – rr. 5, 10 of Or. VIII – When the defendant defaults in filing written statement – What is required by the plaintiff:  Held: In a given case, the defendant defaults in filing written statement and the first alternative were the only course to be adopted (pronouncing judgment against defendant), it would tantamount to a plaintiff being altogether relieved of its obligation to prove his case to the satisfaction of the court – Generally, in order to be entitled to a judgment in his favour, what is required of a plaintiff is to prove his pleaded case by adducing evidence – Rule 10, in fact, has to be read together with Rule 5 of Order VIII and the position seems to be clear that a trial court, at its discretion, may require any fact, treated as admitted, to be so proved otherwise than by such admission – Since facts are required to be pleaded in a plaint and not the evidence, which can be adduced in course of examination of witnesses, mere failure or neglect of a defendant to file a written statement controverting the pleaded facts in the plaint, in all cases, may not entitle him to a judgment in his favour unless by adducing evidence he proves his case/claim. [Para 18]. Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 – Jurisdiction – Essence of: Held: The essence really is that a court must not only have the jurisdiction in respect of the subject matter of dispute for the purpose of entertaining and trying the claim but also the jurisdiction to grant relief that is sought for – Once it is conceded that the jurisdiction on both counts is available, it is immaterial if jurisdiction is exercised erroneously – An erroneous decision cannot be labelled as having been passed ‘without jurisdiction’ – It is, therefore, imperative that the distinction between a decision lacking in inherent jurisdiction and a decision which suffers from an error committed in the exercise of jurisdiction is borne in mind. [Para 35]. Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 – Jurisdiction – Determination of question of jurisdiction by civil Court: Held: Jurisdiction is the entitlement of the civil court to embark upon an enquiry as to whether the cause has been brought before it by the plaintiff in a manner prescribed by law and also whether a good case for grant of relief claimed been set up by him – As and when such entitlement is established, any subsequent error till delivery of judgment could be regarded as an error within the jurisdiction – The enquiry as to whether the civil court is entitled to entertain and try a suit has to be made by it keeping in mind the provision in section 9, CPC and the relevant enactment which, according to the objector, bars a suit – The question of jurisdiction has to be determined at the commencement and not at the conclusion of the enquiry. [Para 38]. . Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 – Jurisdiction – Question of jurisdiction at the stage when a Court considers the question of grant of interim relief: Held: Where interim relief is claimed in a suit before a civil court and the party to be affected by grant of such relief, or any other party to the suit, raises a point of maintainability thereof or that it is barred by law and also contends on that basis that interim relief should not to be granted, grant of relief in whatever form, if at all, ought to be preceded by formation and recording of at least a prima facie satisfaction that the suit is maintainable or that it is not barred by law – It would be inappropriate for a court to abstain from recording its prima facie satisfaction on the question of maintainability, yet, proceed to grant protection pro tem on the assumption that the question of maintainability has to be decided as a preliminary issue under Rule 2 of Order XIV, CPC – That could amount to an improper exercise of power – If the court is of the opinion at the stage of hearing the application for interim relief that the suit is barred by law or is otherwise not maintainable, it cannot dismiss it without framing a preliminary issue after the written statement is filed but can most certainly assign such opinion for refusing interim relief – However, if an extraordinary situation arises where it could take time to decide the point of maintainability of the suit and non-grant of protection pro tem pending such decision could lead to irreversible consequences, the court may proceed to make an appropriate order in the manner justifying the course of action it adopts – In other words, such an order may be passed, if at all required, to avoid irreparable harm or injury or undue hardship to the party claiming the relief and/or to ensure that the proceedings are not rendered infructuous by reason of non-interference by the court. [Para 39].  Judgment/Order – Cardinal principle of: Held: It is one of the cardinal principles of the justice delivery system that any verdict of a competent judicial forum in the form of a judgment/order, that determines the rights and liabilities of the parties to the proceedings, must inform the parties what is the outcome and why one party has succeeded and not the other - the ‘why’ constituting the reasons and ‘what’ the conclusion – Apart from anything else, insistence of the requirement for the reason(s) to support the conclusion guarantees application of mind by the adjudicator to the materials before it as well as provides an avenue to the unsuccessful party to test the reasons before a higher court – All civil courts in the country have to regulate their judicial work in accordance with the terms of the provisions of the CPC – Any egregious breach or violation of such provisions, would be ultra vires.

[Para 38]. . Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 – Jurisdiction – Question of jurisdiction at the stage when a Court considers the question of grant of interim relief: Held: Where interim relief is claimed in a suit before a civil court and the party to be affected by grant of such relief, or any other party to the suit, raises a point of maintainability thereof or that it is barred by law and also contends on that basis that interim relief should not to be granted, grant of relief in whatever form, if at all, ought to be preceded by formation and recording of at least a prima facie satisfaction that the suit is maintainable or that it is not barred by law – It would be inappropriate for a court to abstain from recording its prima facie satisfaction on the question of maintainability, yet, proceed to grant protection pro tem on the assumption that the question of maintainability has to be decided as a preliminary issue under Rule 2 of Order XIV, CPC – That could amount to an improper exercise of power – If the court is of the opinion at the stage of hearing the application for interim relief that the suit is barred by law or is otherwise not maintainable, it cannot dismiss it without framing a preliminary issue after the written statement is filed but can most certainly assign such opinion for refusing interim relief – However, if an extraordinary situation arises where it could take time to decide the point of maintainability of the suit and non-grant of protection pro tem pending such decision could lead to irreversible consequences, the court may proceed to make an appropriate order in the manner justifying the course of action it adopts – In other words, such an order may be passed, if at all required, to avoid irreparable harm or injury or undue hardship to the party claiming the relief and/or to ensure that the proceedings are not rendered infructuous by reason of non-interference by the court. [Para 39].  Judgment/Order – Cardinal principle of: Held: It is one of the cardinal principles of the justice delivery system that any verdict of a competent judicial forum in the form of a judgment/order, that determines the rights and liabilities of the parties to the proceedings, must inform the parties what is the outcome and why one party has succeeded and not the other - the ‘why’ constituting the reasons and ‘what’ the conclusion – Apart from anything else, insistence of the requirement for the reason(s) to support the conclusion guarantees application of mind by the adjudicator to the materials before it as well as provides an avenue to the unsuccessful party to test the reasons before a higher court – All civil courts in the country have to regulate their judicial work in accordance with the terms of the provisions of the CPC – Any egregious breach or violation of such provisions, would be ultra vires.

VIII and s.47 – Respondents 1 to 3 had filed an objection u/s. 47 of the CPC in an execution application filed before the Executing Court by the appellants-plaintiffs – It was urged, based on the case pleaded therein, that the decree put to execution was inexecutable – The Executing Court allowed the objections and the execution application was dismissed – However, the Revisional Court directed the Executing Court to proceed with the execution of decree – Respondents 1 to 3 filed application u/Art. 227 against the revisional order – The High Court quashed the order passed by the Revisional Court and relegated the parties to the remedy of having their rights, in respect of the suit property, adjudicated by the appropriate forum – Propriety: Held: Appellants-plaintiffs had instituted a civil suit against the three defendants-K (defendant no.1), K’s son S (defendant no.2) and R (defendant no.3) – K filed his written statement on 05.12.1990 and inter-alia contended that suit was barred by s.331 of the Uttar Pradesh Zamindari Abolition and Land Reforms Act, 1950 – No written statements was filed by other two defendants – Appellants moved an application u/rr. 5, 10 of Or.VIII, CPC for pronouncement of judgment against S (defendant no.2) and the same was allowed – K passed away and the suit against him was dismissed as abated – In the instant case, the trial Court is presumed to be aware of the fact that the written statement of K was on record or else it would not have fixed the next date for settling ‘issues’ – In a situation where maintainability of the suit was in question and despite S not having filed his written statement, it was not a case where the Trial Court could simply pronounce judgment without even recording a satisfaction that it had the jurisdiction to try the suit and adjudicate the contentious issue(s), not to speak of pronouncing its verdict against S without assigning a single reason by treating the averments in the plaint to be admitted – The High Court rightly observed that even on pronouncement of judgment against S, the lis remained alive as against K and decision on the objection as to maintainability could have resulted in a contrary decision – In the matter at hand, the filing of the written statement by K denying the averments made in the plaint warranted that the appellants’ claims be proved by evidence, oral and/or documentary, instead of decreeing the suit against one of the defendants in a most slipshod manner – As far as the objection available to the respondents 1 to 3 u/s. 47 of CPC is concerned, it is the settled position of law that the powers of an executing court, though narrower than an appellate or revisional court, can be exercised to dismiss an execution application if the decree put to execution is unmistakably found to suffer from an inherent lack of jurisdiction of the court that made the same rendering it a nullity in the eyes of law – The Executing Court and the High Court were right in holding that the objection raised by the respondents 1 to 3 to the executability of the decree was well-founded – Further, the decision rendered by a court on the merits of a controversy in favour of the plaintiff without first adjudicating on its competence to decide such controversy would amount to a decision being rendered on an illegal and erroneous assumption of jurisdiction and, thus, be assailable as lacking in inherent jurisdiction and be treated as a nullity in the eyes of law; as a logical corollary, the order dated 05.08.1991 is held to be ab initio void and the decree drawn up based thereon is inexecutable – That apart, the order dated 05.08.1991 does not reveal any adjudication leading to determination of the rights of the parties in relation to any of the matters in controversy in the suit and therefore, the decree since drawn up is not a formal expression of an adjudication/determination since there has been no adjudication/ determination so as to conform to the requirements of a decree within the meaning of section 2(2) of CPC – Therefore, the trial Court had no authority to decree the suit against S in exercise of its power u/r.10 of Or.VIII, CPC – No reason to interfere with the judgment of the High Court. [Paras 6,20,29,41,50,52].  Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 – r.10 of Or. VIII – Scope and extent of power – Discussed. [Paras 13, 14, 15, 16, 17] Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 – rr. 5, 10 of Or. VIII – When the defendant defaults in filing written statement – What is required by the plaintiff:  Held: In a given case, the defendant defaults in filing written statement and the first alternative were the only course to be adopted (pronouncing judgment against defendant), it would tantamount to a plaintiff being altogether relieved of its obligation to prove his case to the satisfaction of the court – Generally, in order to be entitled to a judgment in his favour, what is required of a plaintiff is to prove his pleaded case by adducing evidence – Rule 10, in fact, has to be read together with Rule 5 of Order VIII and the position seems to be clear that a trial court, at its discretion, may require any fact, treated as admitted, to be so proved otherwise than by such admission – Since facts are required to be pleaded in a plaint and not the evidence, which can be adduced in course of examination of witnesses, mere failure or neglect of a defendant to file a written statement controverting the pleaded facts in the plaint, in all cases, may not entitle him to a judgment in his favour unless by adducing evidence he proves his case/claim. [Para 18]. Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 – Jurisdiction – Essence of: Held: The essence really is that a court must not only have the jurisdiction in respect of the subject matter of dispute for the purpose of entertaining and trying the claim but also the jurisdiction to grant relief that is sought for – Once it is conceded that the jurisdiction on both counts is available, it is immaterial if jurisdiction is exercised erroneously – An erroneous decision cannot be labelled as having been passed ‘without jurisdiction’ – It is, therefore, imperative that the distinction between a decision lacking in inherent jurisdiction and a decision which suffers from an error committed in the exercise of jurisdiction is borne in mind.

        "HeadNote": " Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 – rr. 5, 10 of Or. VIII and s.47 – Respondents 1 to 3 had filed an objection u/s. 47 of the CPC in an execution application filed before the Executing Court by the appellants-plaintiffs – It was urged, based on the case pleaded therein, that the decree put to execution was inexecutable – The Executing Court allowed the objections and the execution application was dismissed – However, the Revisional Court directed the Executing Court to proceed with the execution of decree – Respondents 1 to 3 filed application u/Art. 227 against the revisional order – The High Court quashed the order passed by the Revisional Court and relegated the parties to the remedy of having their rights, in respect of the suit property, adjudicated by the appropriate forum – Propriety: Held: Appellants-plaintiffs had instituted a civil suit against the three defendants-K (defendant no.1), K’s son S (defendant no.2) and R (defendant no.3) – K filed his written statement on 05.12.1990 and inter-alia contended that suit was barred by s.331 of the Uttar Pradesh Zamindari Abolition and Land Reforms Act, 1950 – No written statements was filed by other two defendants – Appellants moved an application u/rr. 5, 10 of Or.VIII, CPC for pronouncement of judgment against S (defendant no.2) and the same was allowed – K passed away and the suit against him was dismissed as abated – In the instant case, the trial Court is presumed to be aware of the fact that the written statement of K was on record or else it would not have fixed the next date for settling ‘issues’ – In a situation where maintainability of the suit was in question and despite S not having filed his written statement, it was not a case where the Trial Court could simply pronounce judgment without even recording a satisfaction that it had the jurisdiction to try the suit and adjudicate the contentious issue(s), not to speak of pronouncing its verdict against S without assigning a single reason by treating the averments in the plaint to be admitted – The High Court rightly observed that even on pronouncement of judgment against S, the lis remained alive as against K and decision on the objection as to maintainability could have resulted in a contrary decision – In the matter at hand, the filing of the written statement by K denying the averments made in the plaint warranted that the appellants’ claims be proved by evidence, oral and/or documentary, instead of decreeing the suit against one of the defendants in a most slipshod manner – As far as the objection available to the respondents 1 to 3 u/s. 47 of CPC is concerned, it is the settled position of law that the powers of an executing court, though narrower than an appellate or revisional court, can be exercised to dismiss an execution application if the decree put to execution is unmistakably found to suffer from an inherent lack of jurisdiction of the court that made the same rendering it a nullity in the eyes of law – The Executing Court and the High Court were right in holding that the objection raised by the respondents 1 to 3 to the executability of the decree was well-founded – Further, the decision rendered by a court on the merits of a controversy in favour of the plaintiff without first adjudicating on its competence to decide such controversy would amount to a decision being rendered on an illegal and erroneous assumption of jurisdiction and, thus, be assailable as lacking in inherent jurisdiction and be treated as a nullity in the eyes of law; as a logical corollary, the order dated 05.08.1991 is held to be ab initio void and the decree drawn up based thereon is inexecutable – That apart, the order dated 05.08.1991 does not reveal any adjudication leading to determination of the rights of the parties in relation to any of the matters in controversy in the suit and therefore, the decree since drawn up is not a formal expression of an adjudication/determination since there has been no adjudication/ determination so as to conform to the requirements of a decree within the meaning of section 2(2) of CPC – Therefore, the trial Court had no authority to decree the suit against S in exercise of its power u/r.10 of Or.VIII, CPC – No reason to interfere with the judgment of the High Court. [Paras 6,20,29,41,50,52].  Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 – r.10 of Or. VIII – Scope and extent of power – Discussed. [Paras 13, 14, 15, 16, 17] Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 – rr. 5, 10 of Or. VIII – When the defendant defaults in filing written statement – What is required by the plaintiff:  Held: In a given case, the defendant defaults in filing written statement and the first alternative were the only course to be adopted (pronouncing judgment against defendant), it would tantamount to a plaintiff being altogether relieved of its obligation to prove his case to the satisfaction of the court – Generally, in order to be entitled to a judgment in his favour, what is required of a plaintiff is to prove his pleaded case by adducing evidence – Rule 10, in fact, has to be read together with Rule 5 of Order VIII and the position seems to be clear that a trial court, at its discretion, may require any fact, treated as admitted, to be so proved otherwise than by such admission – Since facts are required to be pleaded in a plaint and not the evidence, which can be adduced in course of examination of witnesses, mere failure or neglect of a defendant to file a written statement controverting the pleaded facts in the plaint, in all cases, may not entitle him to a judgment in his favour unless by adducing evidence he proves his case/claim. [Para 18]. Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 – Jurisdiction – Essence of: Held: The essence really is that a court must not only have the jurisdiction in respect of the subject matter of dispute for the purpose of entertaining and trying the claim but also the jurisdiction to grant relief that is sought for – Once it is conceded that the jurisdiction on both counts is available, it is immaterial if jurisdiction is exercised erroneously – An erroneous decision cannot be labelled as having been passed ‘without jurisdiction’ – It is, therefore, imperative that the distinction between a decision lacking in inherent jurisdiction and a decision which suffers from an error committed in the exercise of jurisdiction is borne in mind. [Para 35]. Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 – Jurisdiction – Determination of question of jurisdiction by civil Court: Held: Jurisdiction is the entitlement of the civil court to embark upon an enquiry as to whether the cause has been brought before it by the plaintiff in a manner prescribed by law and also whether a good case for grant of relief claimed been set up by him – As and when such entitlement is established, any subsequent error till delivery of judgment could be regarded as an error within the jurisdiction – The enquiry as to whether the civil court is entitled to entertain and try a suit has to be made by it keeping in mind the provision in section 9, CPC and the relevant enactment which, according to the objector, bars a suit – The question of jurisdiction has to be determined at the commencement and not at the conclusion of the enquiry. [Para 38]. . Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 – Jurisdiction – Question of jurisdiction at the stage when a Court considers the question of grant of interim relief: Held: Where interim relief is claimed in a suit before a civil court and the party to be affected by grant of such relief, or any other party to the suit, raises a point of maintainability thereof or that it is barred by law and also contends on that basis that interim relief should not to be granted, grant of relief in whatever form, if at all, ought to be preceded by formation and recording of at least a prima facie satisfaction that the suit is maintainable or that it is not barred by law – It would be inappropriate for a court to abstain from recording its prima facie satisfaction on the question of maintainability, yet, proceed to grant protection pro tem on the assumption that the question of maintainability has to be decided as a preliminary issue under Rule 2 of Order XIV, CPC – That could amount to an improper exercise of power – If the court is of the opinion at the stage of hearing the application for interim relief that the suit is barred by law or is otherwise not maintainable, it cannot dismiss it without framing a preliminary issue after the written statement is filed but can most certainly assign such opinion for refusing interim relief – However, if an extraordinary situation arises where it could take time to decide the point of maintainability of the suit and non-grant of protection pro tem pending such decision could lead to irreversible consequences, the court may proceed to make an appropriate order in the manner justifying the course of action it adopts – In other words, such an order may be passed, if at all required, to avoid irreparable harm or injury or undue hardship to the party claiming the relief and/or to ensure that the proceedings are not rendered infructuous by reason of non-interference by the court. [Para 39].  Judgment/Order – Cardinal principle of: Held: It is one of the cardinal principles of the justice delivery system that any verdict of a competent judicial forum in the form of a judgment/order, that determines the rights and liabilities of the parties to the proceedings, must inform the parties what is the outcome and why one party has succeeded and not the other - the ‘why’ constituting the reasons and ‘what’ the conclusion – Apart from anything else, insistence of the requirement for the reason(s) to support the conclusion guarantees application of mind by the adjudicator to the materials before it as well as provides an avenue to the unsuccessful party to test the reasons before a higher court – All civil courts in the country have to regulate their judicial work in accordance with the terms of the provisions of the CPC – Any egregious breach or violation of such provisions, would be ultra vires.

VIII and s.47 – Respondents 1 to 3 had filed an objection u/s. 47 of the CPC in an execution application filed before the Executing Court by the appellants-plaintiffs – It was urged, based on the case pleaded therein, that the decree put to execution was inexecutable – The Executing Court allowed the objections and the execution application was dismissed – However, the Revisional Court directed the Executing Court to proceed with the execution of decree – Respondents 1 to 3 filed application u/Art. 227 against the revisional order – The High Court quashed the order passed by the Revisional Court and relegated the parties to the remedy of having their rights, in respect of the suit property, adjudicated by the appropriate forum – Propriety: Held: Appellants-plaintiffs had instituted a civil suit against the three defendants-K (defendant no.1), K’s son S (defendant no.2) and R (defendant no.3) – K filed his written statement on 05.12.1990 and inter-alia contended that suit was barred by s.331 of the Uttar Pradesh Zamindari Abolition and Land Reforms Act, 1950 – No written statements was filed by other two defendants – Appellants moved an application u/rr. 5, 10 of Or.VIII, CPC for pronouncement of judgment against S (defendant no.2) and the same was allowed – K passed away and the suit against him was dismissed as abated – In the instant case, the trial Court is presumed to be aware of the fact that the written statement of K was on record or else it would not have fixed the next date for settling ‘issues’ – In a situation where maintainability of the suit was in question and despite S not having filed his written statement, it was not a case where the Trial Court could simply pronounce judgment without even recording a satisfaction that it had the jurisdiction to try the suit and adjudicate the contentious issue(s), not to speak of pronouncing its verdict against S without assigning a single reason by treating the averments in the plaint to be admitted – The High Court rightly observed that even on pronouncement of judgment against S, the lis remained alive as against K and decision on the objection as to maintainability could have resulted in a contrary decision – In the matter at hand, the filing of the written statement by K denying the averments made in the plaint warranted that the appellants’ claims be proved by evidence, oral and/or documentary, instead of decreeing the suit against one of the defendants in a most slipshod manner – As far as the objection available to the respondents 1 to 3 u/s. 47 of CPC is concerned, it is the settled position of law that the powers of an executing court, though narrower than an appellate or revisional court, can be exercised to dismiss an execution application if the decree put to execution is unmistakably found to suffer from an inherent lack of jurisdiction of the court that made the same rendering it a nullity in the eyes of law – The Executing Court and the High Court were right in holding that the objection raised by the respondents 1 to 3 to the executability of the decree was well-founded – Further, the decision rendered by a court on the merits of a controversy in favour of the plaintiff without first adjudicating on its competence to decide such controversy would amount to a decision being rendered on an illegal and erroneous assumption of jurisdiction and, thus, be assailable as lacking in inherent jurisdiction and be treated as a nullity in the eyes of law; as a logical corollary, the order dated 05.08.1991 is held to be ab initio void and the decree drawn up based thereon is inexecutable – That apart, the order dated 05.08.1991 does not reveal any adjudication leading to determination of the rights of the parties in relation to any of the matters in controversy in the suit and therefore, the decree since drawn up is not a formal expression of an adjudication/determination since there has been no adjudication/ determination so as to conform to the requirements of a decree within the meaning of section 2(2) of CPC – Therefore, the trial Court had no authority to decree the suit against S in exercise of its power u/r.10 of Or.VIII, CPC – No reason to interfere with the judgment of the High Court. [Paras 6,20,29,41,50,52].  Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 – r.10 of Or. VIII – Scope and extent of power – Discussed. [Paras 13, 14, 15, 16, 17] Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 – rr. 5, 10 of Or. VIII – When the defendant defaults in filing written statement – What is required by the plaintiff:  Held: In a given case, the defendant defaults in filing written statement and the first alternative were the only course to be adopted (pronouncing judgment against defendant), it would tantamount to a plaintiff being altogether relieved of its obligation to prove his case to the satisfaction of the court – Generally, in order to be entitled to a judgment in his favour, what is required of a plaintiff is to prove his pleaded case by adducing evidence – Rule 10, in fact, has to be read together with Rule 5 of Order VIII and the position seems to be clear that a trial court, at its discretion, may require any fact, treated as admitted, to be so proved otherwise than by such admission – Since facts are required to be pleaded in a plaint and not the evidence, which can be adduced in course of examination of witnesses, mere failure or neglect of a defendant to file a written statement controverting the pleaded facts in the plaint, in all cases, may not entitle him to a judgment in his favour unless by adducing evidence he proves his case/claim. [Para 18]. Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 – Jurisdiction – Essence of: Held: The essence really is that a court must not only have the jurisdiction in respect of the subject matter of dispute for the purpose of entertaining and trying the claim but also the jurisdiction to grant relief that is sought for – Once it is conceded that the jurisdiction on both counts is available, it is immaterial if jurisdiction is exercised erroneously – An erroneous decision cannot be labelled as having been passed ‘without jurisdiction’ – It is, therefore, imperative that the distinction between a decision lacking in inherent jurisdiction and a decision which suffers from an error committed in the exercise of jurisdiction is borne in mind. [Para 35]. Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 – Jurisdiction – Determination of question of jurisdiction by civil Court: Held: Jurisdiction is the entitlement of the civil court to embark upon an enquiry as to whether the cause has been brought before it by the plaintiff in a manner prescribed by law and also whether a good case for grant of relief claimed been set up by him – As and when such entitlement is established, any subsequent error till delivery of judgment could be regarded as an error within the jurisdiction – The enquiry as to whether the civil court is entitled to entertain and try a suit has to be made by it keeping in mind the provision in section 9, CPC and the relevant enactment which, according to the objector, bars a suit – The question of jurisdiction has to be determined at the commencement and not at the conclusion of the enquiry. [Para 38]. . Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 – Jurisdiction – Question of jurisdiction at the stage when a Court considers the question of grant of interim relief: Held: Where interim relief is claimed in a suit before a civil court and the party to be affected by grant of such relief, or any other party to the suit, raises a point of maintainability thereof or that it is barred by law and also contends on that basis that interim relief should not to be granted, grant of relief in whatever form, if at all, ought to be preceded by formation and recording of at least a prima facie satisfaction that the suit is maintainable or that it is not barred by law – It would be inappropriate for a court to abstain from recording its prima facie satisfaction on the question of maintainability, yet, proceed to grant protection pro tem on the assumption that the question of maintainability has to be decided as a preliminary issue under Rule 2 of Order XIV, CPC – That could amount to an improper exercise of power – If the court is of the opinion at the stage of hearing the application for interim relief that the suit is barred by law or is otherwise not maintainable, it cannot dismiss it without framing a preliminary issue after the written statement is filed but can most certainly assign such opinion for refusing interim relief – However, if an extraordinary situation arises where it could take time to decide the point of maintainability of the suit and non-grant of protection pro tem pending such decision could lead to irreversible consequences, the court may proceed to make an appropriate order in the manner justifying the course of action it adopts – In other words, such an order may be passed, if at all required, to avoid irreparable harm or injury or undue hardship to the party claiming the relief and/or to ensure that the proceedings are not rendered infructuous by reason of non-interference by the court. [Para 39].  Judgment/Order – Cardinal principle of: Held: It is one of the cardinal principles of the justice delivery system that any verdict of a competent judicial forum in the form of a judgment/order, that determines the rights and liabilities of the parties to the proceedings, must inform the parties what is the outcome and why one party has succeeded and not the other - the ‘why’ constituting the reasons and ‘what’ the conclusion – Apart from anything else, insistence of the requirement for the reason(s) to support the conclusion guarantees application of mind by the adjudicator to the materials before it as well as provides an avenue to the unsuccessful party to test the reasons before a higher court – All civil courts in the country have to regulate their judicial work in accordance with the terms of the provisions of the CPC – Any egregious breach or violation of such provisions, would be ultra vires.
