        "content": "Constitution of India: Art.227 – Supervisory control by High Court – Eviction petition filed u/s.14 of Delhi Rent Control, 1958 on the ground that tenanted premises was sub-let to three medical practitioners without consent of landlord – Rent Controller dismissed the petition – Appellate Tribunal reversed the decision of the Rent controller and ordered eviction – Tenants invoked provisions of Art.227 before the High Court – High Court upset the order of eviction passed by the appellate tribunal – On appeal, Held: Whether the decision of High Court in upsetting order of eviction passed by Appellate Tribunal suffered from any element of perversity or not – High Court has restrictive nature of jurisdiction u/Art.227 – There are three situations as to when a finding on facts or questions of law would be perverse (a) Erroneous on account of nonconsideration of material evidence, or (b) Being conclusions which are contrary to the evidence, or (c) Based on inferences that are impermissible in law – There was overstepping of this boundary by the supervisory Court – High Court had gone deep into the factual arena to disagree with the fact finding forum – There is no dispute that the three medical practitioners were in occupation of part of the premises in question – The onus was on the tenants to establish the degree of control they were maintaining over the said premises for repelling the plea of sub-letting – Many factors were considered by the Appellate Tribunal on the basis of which its decision was against the tenants – Hence, there was no perversity on the basis of which High Court could have interfered – High Court tested the legality of the order of the Tribunal through the lens of an appellate body and not as a supervisory Court u/Art. 227 which is impermissible – High Court judgment set aside – Appellate Tribunal’s finding restored – Delhi Rent Control, 1958 – s.14(1)(b)."

Statutory Corporation – Dispute between statutory corporation and a private entity – Settlement – Effect of – Held: Unless the settlement arrived is found to be in the interest of both the parties, it cannot be thrust upon a statutory Corporation to its detriment and to the advantage of a private entity."

        "HeadNote": "Armed Forces: One Rank One Pension-OROP – Constitutionality of – Writ petition challenging the manner in which the OROP policy for ex-servicemen of defence forces has been implemented by the Union of India through a letter dated 07.11.2015 issued to the Chiefs of three defence forces – Letter defining OROP as the payment of uniform pension to armed services personnel retiring in the same rank with the same length of service, irrespective of the date of retirement; that OROP aims to bridge the gap between the rate of pension of current and past pensioners at periodic intervals – Petitioners case that in the course of implementation, the principle of OROP has been replaced by ‘one rank multiple pensions’ for persons with the same length of service; that the initial definition of OROP was altered by the UOI and, instead of an automatic revision of the rates of pension, where any future enhancement to the rates of pension are automatically passed on to the past pensioners, the revision now would take place at periodic intervals, is arbitrary and unconstitutional – Held: There is no constitutional infirmity in the OROP principle as defined by the communication dated 07.11.2015 – Definition of OROP is uniformly applicable to all the pensioners irrespective of the date of retirement – Cut-off date is used only for the purpose of determining the base salary for the calculation of pension – While for those who retired after 2014, the last drawn salary is used to calculate pension, for those who retired prior to 2013, the average salary drawn in 2013 is used – Since the uniform application of the last drawn salary for the purpose of calculating pension would put the prior retirees at a disadvantage, the Union Government has taken a policy decision to enhance the base salary for the calculation of pension – Such a decision lies within the ambit of policy choices – There was no conscious policy decision on the part of the Union Government on the modalities for implementing OROP until the communication dated 07.11.2015 came into being, and thus, the communication of 07.11.2015 cannot be invalidated on the ground that it infringed the ‘original understanding’ of OROP – Expression ‘automatically passed on’ cannot be construed as a commitment with reference to any period of time for the computation of benefits – Decision of the Central Government to revise the pension every five years cannot be held to violate the precepts underlying Art. 14 – Policy decision – Constitution of India – Art. 14, 32 – Service law. Pension – One Rank One Pension-OROP – Legitimate Expectation – Invocation of – Held: Doctrine of legitimate expectations can be invoked if a representation made by a public body leads an individual to believe that they would be a recipient of a substantive benefit – Doctrine of legitimate expectations emerges as a facet of Art. 14 – However, in the present case, there was no concrete government policy in existence prior to 07.11.2015 – There existed only certain assurances – These assurances were also to the effect that OROP has been accepted in principle - Implementation was yet to be worked out. Pension – One Rank One Pension – Concept and genesis of – Policy and Principles – Discussed. Administrative Law: Policy Decisions – Scope of judicial review – Held: Adjudication cannot serve as a substitute for policy – Most questions of policy involve complex considerations of not only technical and economic factors but also require balancing competing interests for which democratic reconciliation rather than adjudication is the best remedy – An increased reliance on judges to solve matters of pure policy diminishes the role of other political organs in resolving contested issues of social and political policy, which require a democratic dialogue – It is not that this Court will shy away from setting aside policies that impinge on constitutional rights – Rather it is to provide a clear-eyed role of the function that a court serves in a democracy – One Rank One Pension-OROP is itself a matter of policy and it was open to the makers of the policy to determine the terms of implementation – Policy is of course subject to judicial review on constitutional parameters, which is a distinct issue.",

SP ,and DCP all fall within the same rank – (ii) The approval order under s.23(1)(a) MCOCA is with respect to the offence and not the offender – Though illegal gambling is not an organized crime but it may be route through which the accused were abetting the commission of organized crime, therefore the appellants may be charged with some offences punishable under MCOCA in relation to the charge of illegal gambling – Further, more than one chargesheet is not required to be filed with respect to each accused",

SP) u/s 18 MCOCA cannot be proved against the accused (As s.18(1) provides for, confession made by a police officer “not below the rank of the superintendent of Police” shall be admissible in trial) and (ii) The provisions of MCOCA have not been validly invoked – Held:– (i) The expression “rank” must be understood as a class or category which encompasses multiple posts – The posts of SP, Addl. SP ,and DCP all fall within the same rank – (ii) The approval order under s.23(1)(a) MCOCA is with respect to the offence and not the offender – Though illegal gambling is not an organized crime but it may be route through which the accused were abetting the commission of organized crime, therefore the appellants may be charged with some offences punishable under MCOCA in relation to the charge of illegal gambling – Further, more than one chargesheet is not required to be filed with respect to each accused",

Criminal Trial – Death Sentence – When to be awarded – Discussed – A two-step process has to be followed to determine whether a case deserves death sentence – Firstly, that the case belongs to the ‘rarest of rare’ category, and secondly, that the option of life imprisonment would simply not suffice – For the first step, the aggravating and mitigating circumstances would have to be identified and considered equally – For the second, the court has to consider whether the alternative of life imprisonment was unquestionable foreclosed as the sentencing aim of reformation was unachievable, for which the State must provide material.Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 – Test Identification Parade – TIPs are meant to test witness veracity and their capability to identify unknown persons – TIPs should be conducted at the earliest possible time to eliminate the chance of accused being shown to witnesses before the identification parade, which might otherwise affect such witnesses’ memory – No provision of law enables an accused to claim TIP as a matter of right – Delay or failure in holding TIP ipso facto does not render the evidence inadmissible or unacceptable, however it affects the credibility and weight attached to such identification. Evidence Act, 1872 – Circumstantial Evidence – Principles applicable to appreciation of evidence – The correct approach of courts trying criminal cases involving circumstantial evidence should be that the circumstances alleged, be fully established – All the facts so established should be consistent only with hypothesis of the guilt of the accused – Circumstances should be conclusive and of such tendency that they should be such as to exclude every hypothesis but the one proposed to be proved. Criminal Trial – Practice and Procedures – Omission of prosecution witness to state a fact – Effect of: The omission of some of the prosecution witnesses to mention a particular fact, or corroborate something, which is deposed to by other witnesses does not ipso facto favour an accused – However, more important is whether the omission to depose about a fact is so fundamental that the prosecution version becomes shaky and incredulous. Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 – s. 24 – Role of Public Prosecutor in Criminal Trial – Public prosecutor occupies a statutory office of high regard – They are not part of the investigating agency, rather an independent statutory authority who serve as officers to the court – The role of the public prosecutor is intrinsically dedicated to conducting a fair trial and not for a ‘thirst to reach the case in conviction’. Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 – ss.172, 173 – Maintenance of case diary mandatory – Police have the power to investigate freely and fairly, in the course of which, it is mandatory to maintain a diary where the day-to-day proceedings are to be recorded with specific mention of time of events, places visited, departure and reporting back, statements recorded, etc – Criminal Court is empowered to summon these diaries u/s 172(2) for purpose of inquiry or trial, s. 173(3) makes it clear that the accused cannot claim any right to peruse them, unless the police themselves, rely on it to refresh their memory or if the court uses it for contradicting the testimony of the police officers. Criminal Trial – Fundamental canons of criminal jurisprudence founded on Arts. 20 and 21 of the Constitution require not just the investigating agency but also courts in their own independent field, to ensure that investigation is fair and does not hamper the individual’s freedom, except in accordance with law, i.e., ensure adherence to the rule of law. Criminal Trial – Practical guidelines to collect mitigating circumstances – Trial Court must elicit information from the accused and the State both – The State must for an offence carrying capital punishment - at the appropriate stage, produce material which is preferably collected beforehand, before the Sessions Court disclosing psychiatric and psychological evaluation of the accused – This will help establish proximity to the accused person’s frame of mind – The State must in a time-bound manner collect additional information pertaining to the accused –Information regarding the accused’s jail conduct and behaviour, activities the accused involved themselves in, and other related details should be called for in the form of a report from the relevant jail authorities. Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 – Sentencing – An effective sentencing hearing to the accused at the relevant stage is a right under s.235(2).",

        "HeadNote": "Sentence / Sentencing – Penal Code, 1860 – ss.302, 397 – Triple murder, in course of robbery – Three accused – Trial Court convicted the accused-appellants u/s. 302 IPC and imposed death penalty on them – High Court confirmed the conviction – On appeal, held: Both the trial Court and High Court failed to provide an effective sentencing hearing to the accused at the relevant stage which is a right u/s 235(2) CrPC – The crime that the appellants were held guilty of, was heinous, and its execution was vicious and cruel – The repeated stabbings of two of the deceased almost in a frenzy on the one hand and the defenceless state of the victims, on the other, highlights that the accused were willing to go ahead with their plans of robbing after eliminating the three women – At the same time, the young age of the accused at the time of the incident and lack of criminal antecedents cannot be lost sight of – Prosecution case is silent on any real motive that may have instigated or moved the three accused to have pre-planned for the commission of murder other than robbery itself – Death sentence of all three accused commuted to life imprisonment for a minimum term of 25 years – Arms Act – s.27. Criminal Trial – Death Sentence – When to be awarded – Discussed – A two-step process has to be followed to determine whether a case deserves death sentence – Firstly, that the case belongs to the ‘rarest of rare’ category, and secondly, that the option of life imprisonment would simply not suffice – For the first step, the aggravating and mitigating circumstances would have to be identified and considered equally – For the second, the court has to consider whether the alternative of life imprisonment was unquestionable foreclosed as the sentencing aim of reformation was unachievable, for which the State must provide material.Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 – Test Identification Parade – TIPs are meant to test witness veracity and their capability to identify unknown persons – TIPs should be conducted at the earliest possible time to eliminate the chance of accused being shown to witnesses before the identification parade, which might otherwise affect such witnesses’ memory – No provision of law enables an accused to claim TIP as a matter of right – Delay or failure in holding TIP ipso facto does not render the evidence inadmissible or unacceptable, however it affects the credibility and weight attached to such identification. Evidence Act, 1872 – Circumstantial Evidence – Principles applicable to appreciation of evidence – The correct approach of courts trying criminal cases involving circumstantial evidence should be that the circumstances alleged, be fully established – All the facts so established should be consistent only with hypothesis of the guilt of the accused – Circumstances should be conclusive and of such tendency that they should be such as to exclude every hypothesis but the one proposed to be proved. Criminal Trial – Practice and Procedures – Omission of prosecution witness to state a fact – Effect of: The omission of some of the prosecution witnesses to mention a particular fact, or corroborate something, which is deposed to by other witnesses does not ipso facto favour an accused – However, more important is whether the omission to depose about a fact is so fundamental that the prosecution version becomes shaky and incredulous. Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 – s. 24 – Role of Public Prosecutor in Criminal Trial – Public prosecutor occupies a statutory office of high regard – They are not part of the investigating agency, rather an independent statutory authority who serve as officers to the court – The role of the public prosecutor is intrinsically dedicated to conducting a fair trial and not for a ‘thirst to reach the case in conviction’. Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 – ss.172, 173 – Maintenance of case diary mandatory – Police have the power to investigate freely and fairly, in the course of which, it is mandatory to maintain a diary where the day-to-day proceedings are to be recorded with specific mention of time of events, places visited, departure and reporting back, statements recorded, etc – Criminal Court is empowered to summon these diaries u/s 172(2) for purpose of inquiry or trial, s. 173(3) makes it clear that the accused cannot claim any right to peruse them, unless the police themselves, rely on it to refresh their memory or if the court uses it for contradicting the testimony of the police officers. Criminal Trial – Fundamental canons of criminal jurisprudence founded on Arts. 20 and 21 of the Constitution require not just the investigating agency but also courts in their own independent field, to ensure that investigation is fair and does not hamper the individual’s freedom, except in accordance with law, i.e., ensure adherence to the rule of law. Criminal Trial – Practical guidelines to collect mitigating circumstances – Trial Court must elicit information from the accused and the State both – The State must for an offence carrying capital punishment - at the appropriate stage, produce material which is preferably collected beforehand, before the Sessions Court disclosing psychiatric and psychological evaluation of the accused – This will help establish proximity to the accused person’s frame of mind – The State must in a time-bound manner collect additional information pertaining to the accused –Information regarding the accused’s jail conduct and behaviour, activities the accused involved themselves in, and other related details should be called for in the form of a report from the relevant jail authorities. Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 – Sentencing – An effective sentencing hearing to the accused at the relevant stage is a right under s.235(2).",

        "HeadNote": "Sentence / Sentencing – Penal Code, 1860 – ss.302, 397 – Triple murder, in course of robbery – Three accused – Trial Court convicted the accused-appellants u/s. 302 IPC and imposed death penalty on them – High Court confirmed the conviction – On appeal, held: Both the trial Court and High Court failed to provide an effective sentencing hearing to the accused at the relevant stage which is a right u/s 235(2) CrPC – The crime that the appellants were held guilty of, was heinous, and its execution was vicious and cruel – The repeated stabbings of two of the deceased almost in a frenzy on the one hand and the defenceless state of the victims, on the other, highlights that the accused were willing to go ahead with their plans of robbing after eliminating the three women – At the same time, the young age of the accused at the time of the incident and lack of criminal antecedents cannot be lost sight of – Prosecution case is silent on any real motive that may have instigated or moved the three accused to have pre-planned for the commission of murder other than robbery itself – Death sentence of all three accused commuted to life imprisonment for a minimum term of 25 years – Arms Act – s.27. Criminal Trial – Death Sentence – When to be awarded – Discussed – A two-step process has to be followed to determine whether a case deserves death sentence – Firstly, that the case belongs to the ‘rarest of rare’ category, and secondly, that the option of life imprisonment would simply not suffice – For the first step, the aggravating and mitigating circumstances would have to be identified and considered equally – For the second, the court has to consider whether the alternative of life imprisonment was unquestionable foreclosed as the sentencing aim of reformation was unachievable, for which the State must provide material.Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 – Test Identification Parade – TIPs are meant to test witness veracity and their capability to identify unknown persons – TIPs should be conducted at the earliest possible time to eliminate the chance of accused being shown to witnesses before the identification parade, which might otherwise affect such witnesses’ memory – No provision of law enables an accused to claim TIP as a matter of right – Delay or failure in holding TIP ipso facto does not render the evidence inadmissible or unacceptable, however it affects the credibility and weight attached to such identification. Evidence Act, 1872 – Circumstantial Evidence – Principles applicable to appreciation of evidence – The correct approach of courts trying criminal cases involving circumstantial evidence should be that the circumstances alleged, be fully established – All the facts so established should be consistent only with hypothesis of the guilt of the accused – Circumstances should be conclusive and of such tendency that they should be such as to exclude every hypothesis but the one proposed to be proved. Criminal Trial – Practice and Procedures – Omission of prosecution witness to state a fact – Effect of: The omission of some of the prosecution witnesses to mention a particular fact, or corroborate something, which is deposed to by other witnesses does not ipso facto favour an accused – However, more important is whether the omission to depose about a fact is so fundamental that the prosecution version becomes shaky and incredulous. Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 – s. 24 – Role of Public Prosecutor in Criminal Trial – Public prosecutor occupies a statutory office of high regard – They are not part of the investigating agency, rather an independent statutory authority who serve as officers to the court – The role of the public prosecutor is intrinsically dedicated to conducting a fair trial and not for a ‘thirst to reach the case in conviction’. Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 – ss.172, 173 – Maintenance of case diary mandatory – Police have the power to investigate freely and fairly, in the course of which, it is mandatory to maintain a diary where the day-to-day proceedings are to be recorded with specific mention of time of events, places visited, departure and reporting back, statements recorded, etc – Criminal Court is empowered to summon these diaries u/s 172(2) for purpose of inquiry or trial, s. 173(3) makes it clear that the accused cannot claim any right to peruse them, unless the police themselves, rely on it to refresh their memory or if the court uses it for contradicting the testimony of the police officers. Criminal Trial – Fundamental canons of criminal jurisprudence founded on Arts. 20 and 21 of the Constitution require not just the investigating agency but also courts in their own independent field, to ensure that investigation is fair and does not hamper the individual’s freedom, except in accordance with law, i.e., ensure adherence to the rule of law. Criminal Trial – Practical guidelines to collect mitigating circumstances – Trial Court must elicit information from the accused and the State both – The State must for an offence carrying capital punishment - at the appropriate stage, produce material which is preferably collected beforehand, before the Sessions Court disclosing psychiatric and psychological evaluation of the accused – This will help establish proximity to the accused person’s frame of mind – The State must in a time-bound manner collect additional information pertaining to the accused –Information regarding the accused’s jail conduct and behaviour, activities the accused involved themselves in, and other related details should be called for in the form of a report from the relevant jail authorities. Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 – Sentencing – An effective sentencing hearing to the accused at the relevant stage is a right under s.235(2).",

        "HeadNote": "Sentence / Sentencing – Penal Code, 1860 – ss.302, 397 – Triple murder, in course of robbery – Three accused – Trial Court convicted the accused-appellants u/s. 302 IPC and imposed death penalty on them – High Court confirmed the conviction – On appeal, held: Both the trial Court and High Court failed to provide an effective sentencing hearing to the accused at the relevant stage which is a right u/s 235(2) CrPC – The crime that the appellants were held guilty of, was heinous, and its execution was vicious and cruel – The repeated stabbings of two of the deceased almost in a frenzy on the one hand and the defenceless state of the victims, on the other, highlights that the accused were willing to go ahead with their plans of robbing after eliminating the three women – At the same time, the young age of the accused at the time of the incident and lack of criminal antecedents cannot be lost sight of – Prosecution case is silent on any real motive that may have instigated or moved the three accused to have pre-planned for the commission of murder other than robbery itself – Death sentence of all three accused commuted to life imprisonment for a minimum term of 25 years – Arms Act – s.27. Criminal Trial – Death Sentence – When to be awarded – Discussed – A two-step process has to be followed to determine whether a case deserves death sentence – Firstly, that the case belongs to the ‘rarest of rare’ category, and secondly, that the option of life imprisonment would simply not suffice – For the first step, the aggravating and mitigating circumstances would have to be identified and considered equally – For the second, the court has to consider whether the alternative of life imprisonment was unquestionable foreclosed as the sentencing aim of reformation was unachievable, for which the State must provide material.Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 – Test Identification Parade – TIPs are meant to test witness veracity and their capability to identify unknown persons – TIPs should be conducted at the earliest possible time to eliminate the chance of accused being shown to witnesses before the identification parade, which might otherwise affect such witnesses’ memory – No provision of law enables an accused to claim TIP as a matter of right – Delay or failure in holding TIP ipso facto does not render the evidence inadmissible or unacceptable, however it affects the credibility and weight attached to such identification. Evidence Act, 1872 – Circumstantial Evidence – Principles applicable to appreciation of evidence – The correct approach of courts trying criminal cases involving circumstantial evidence should be that the circumstances alleged, be fully established – All the facts so established should be consistent only with hypothesis of the guilt of the accused – Circumstances should be conclusive and of such tendency that they should be such as to exclude every hypothesis but the one proposed to be proved. Criminal Trial – Practice and Procedures – Omission of prosecution witness to state a fact – Effect of: The omission of some of the prosecution witnesses to mention a particular fact, or corroborate something, which is deposed to by other witnesses does not ipso facto favour an accused – However, more important is whether the omission to depose about a fact is so fundamental that the prosecution version becomes shaky and incredulous. Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 – s. 24 – Role of Public Prosecutor in Criminal Trial – Public prosecutor occupies a statutory office of high regard – They are not part of the investigating agency, rather an independent statutory authority who serve as officers to the court – The role of the public prosecutor is intrinsically dedicated to conducting a fair trial and not for a ‘thirst to reach the case in conviction’. Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 – ss.172, 173 – Maintenance of case diary mandatory – Police have the power to investigate freely and fairly, in the course of which, it is mandatory to maintain a diary where the day-to-day proceedings are to be recorded with specific mention of time of events, places visited, departure and reporting back, statements recorded, etc – Criminal Court is empowered to summon these diaries u/s 172(2) for purpose of inquiry or trial, s. 173(3) makes it clear that the accused cannot claim any right to peruse them, unless the police themselves, rely on it to refresh their memory or if the court uses it for contradicting the testimony of the police officers. Criminal Trial – Fundamental canons of criminal jurisprudence founded on Arts. 20 and 21 of the Constitution require not just the investigating agency but also courts in their own independent field, to ensure that investigation is fair and does not hamper the individual’s freedom, except in accordance with law, i.e., ensure adherence to the rule of law. Criminal Trial – Practical guidelines to collect mitigating circumstances – Trial Court must elicit information from the accused and the State both – The State must for an offence carrying capital punishment - at the appropriate stage, produce material which is preferably collected beforehand, before the Sessions Court disclosing psychiatric and psychological evaluation of the accused – This will help establish proximity to the accused person’s frame of mind – The State must in a time-bound manner collect additional information pertaining to the accused –Information regarding the accused’s jail conduct and behaviour, activities the accused involved themselves in, and other related details should be called for in the form of a report from the relevant jail authorities. Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 – Sentencing – An effective sentencing hearing to the accused at the relevant stage is a right under s.235(2).",

        "HeadNote": "Sentence / Sentencing – Penal Code, 1860 – ss.302, 397 – Triple murder, in course of robbery – Three accused – Trial Court convicted the accused-appellants u/s. 302 IPC and imposed death penalty on them – High Court confirmed the conviction – On appeal, held: Both the trial Court and High Court failed to provide an effective sentencing hearing to the accused at the relevant stage which is a right u/s 235(2) CrPC – The crime that the appellants were held guilty of, was heinous, and its execution was vicious and cruel – The repeated stabbings of two of the deceased almost in a frenzy on the one hand and the defenceless state of the victims, on the other, highlights that the accused were willing to go ahead with their plans of robbing after eliminating the three women – At the same time, the young age of the accused at the time of the incident and lack of criminal antecedents cannot be lost sight of – Prosecution case is silent on any real motive that may have instigated or moved the three accused to have pre-planned for the commission of murder other than robbery itself – Death sentence of all three accused commuted to life imprisonment for a minimum term of 25 years – Arms Act – s.27. Criminal Trial – Death Sentence – When to be awarded – Discussed – A two-step process has to be followed to determine whether a case deserves death sentence – Firstly, that the case belongs to the ‘rarest of rare’ category, and secondly, that the option of life imprisonment would simply not suffice – For the first step, the aggravating and mitigating circumstances would have to be identified and considered equally – For the second, the court has to consider whether the alternative of life imprisonment was unquestionable foreclosed as the sentencing aim of reformation was unachievable, for which the State must provide material.Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 – Test Identification Parade – TIPs are meant to test witness veracity and their capability to identify unknown persons – TIPs should be conducted at the earliest possible time to eliminate the chance of accused being shown to witnesses before the identification parade, which might otherwise affect such witnesses’ memory – No provision of law enables an accused to claim TIP as a matter of right – Delay or failure in holding TIP ipso facto does not render the evidence inadmissible or unacceptable, however it affects the credibility and weight attached to such identification. Evidence Act, 1872 – Circumstantial Evidence – Principles applicable to appreciation of evidence – The correct approach of courts trying criminal cases involving circumstantial evidence should be that the circumstances alleged, be fully established – All the facts so established should be consistent only with hypothesis of the guilt of the accused – Circumstances should be conclusive and of such tendency that they should be such as to exclude every hypothesis but the one proposed to be proved. Criminal Trial – Practice and Procedures – Omission of prosecution witness to state a fact – Effect of: The omission of some of the prosecution witnesses to mention a particular fact, or corroborate something, which is deposed to by other witnesses does not ipso facto favour an accused – However, more important is whether the omission to depose about a fact is so fundamental that the prosecution version becomes shaky and incredulous. Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 – s. 24 – Role of Public Prosecutor in Criminal Trial – Public prosecutor occupies a statutory office of high regard – They are not part of the investigating agency, rather an independent statutory authority who serve as officers to the court – The role of the public prosecutor is intrinsically dedicated to conducting a fair trial and not for a ‘thirst to reach the case in conviction’. Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 – ss.172, 173 – Maintenance of case diary mandatory – Police have the power to investigate freely and fairly, in the course of which, it is mandatory to maintain a diary where the day-to-day proceedings are to be recorded with specific mention of time of events, places visited, departure and reporting back, statements recorded, etc – Criminal Court is empowered to summon these diaries u/s 172(2) for purpose of inquiry or trial, s. 173(3) makes it clear that the accused cannot claim any right to peruse them, unless the police themselves, rely on it to refresh their memory or if the court uses it for contradicting the testimony of the police officers. Criminal Trial – Fundamental canons of criminal jurisprudence founded on Arts. 20 and 21 of the Constitution require not just the investigating agency but also courts in their own independent field, to ensure that investigation is fair and does not hamper the individual’s freedom, except in accordance with law, i.e., ensure adherence to the rule of law. Criminal Trial – Practical guidelines to collect mitigating circumstances – Trial Court must elicit information from the accused and the State both – The State must for an offence carrying capital punishment - at the appropriate stage, produce material which is preferably collected beforehand, before the Sessions Court disclosing psychiatric and psychological evaluation of the accused – This will help establish proximity to the accused person’s frame of mind – The State must in a time-bound manner collect additional information pertaining to the accused –Information regarding the accused’s jail conduct and behaviour, activities the accused involved themselves in, and other related details should be called for in the form of a report from the relevant jail authorities. Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 – Sentencing – An effective sentencing hearing to the accused at the relevant stage is a right under s.235(2).",

        "HeadNote": "Sentence / Sentencing – Penal Code, 1860 – ss.302, 397 – Triple murder, in course of robbery – Three accused – Trial Court convicted the accused-appellants u/s. 302 IPC and imposed death penalty on them – High Court confirmed the conviction – On appeal, held: Both the trial Court and High Court failed to provide an effective sentencing hearing to the accused at the relevant stage which is a right u/s 235(2) CrPC – The crime that the appellants were held guilty of, was heinous, and its execution was vicious and cruel – The repeated stabbings of two of the deceased almost in a frenzy on the one hand and the defenceless state of the victims, on the other, highlights that the accused were willing to go ahead with their plans of robbing after eliminating the three women – At the same time, the young age of the accused at the time of the incident and lack of criminal antecedents cannot be lost sight of – Prosecution case is silent on any real motive that may have instigated or moved the three accused to have pre-planned for the commission of murder other than robbery itself – Death sentence of all three accused commuted to life imprisonment for a minimum term of 25 years – Arms Act – s.27. Criminal Trial – Death Sentence – When to be awarded – Discussed – A two-step process has to be followed to determine whether a case deserves death sentence – Firstly, that the case belongs to the ‘rarest of rare’ category, and secondly, that the option of life imprisonment would simply not suffice – For the first step, the aggravating and mitigating circumstances would have to be identified and considered equally – For the second, the court has to consider whether the alternative of life imprisonment was unquestionable foreclosed as the sentencing aim of reformation was unachievable, for which the State must provide material.Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 – Test Identification Parade – TIPs are meant to test witness veracity and their capability to identify unknown persons – TIPs should be conducted at the earliest possible time to eliminate the chance of accused being shown to witnesses before the identification parade, which might otherwise affect such witnesses’ memory – No provision of law enables an accused to claim TIP as a matter of right – Delay or failure in holding TIP ipso facto does not render the evidence inadmissible or unacceptable, however it affects the credibility and weight attached to such identification. Evidence Act, 1872 – Circumstantial Evidence – Principles applicable to appreciation of evidence – The correct approach of courts trying criminal cases involving circumstantial evidence should be that the circumstances alleged, be fully established – All the facts so established should be consistent only with hypothesis of the guilt of the accused – Circumstances should be conclusive and of such tendency that they should be such as to exclude every hypothesis but the one proposed to be proved. Criminal Trial – Practice and Procedures – Omission of prosecution witness to state a fact – Effect of: The omission of some of the prosecution witnesses to mention a particular fact, or corroborate something, which is deposed to by other witnesses does not ipso facto favour an accused – However, more important is whether the omission to depose about a fact is so fundamental that the prosecution version becomes shaky and incredulous. Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 – s. 24 – Role of Public Prosecutor in Criminal Trial – Public prosecutor occupies a statutory office of high regard – They are not part of the investigating agency, rather an independent statutory authority who serve as officers to the court – The role of the public prosecutor is intrinsically dedicated to conducting a fair trial and not for a ‘thirst to reach the case in conviction’. Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 – ss.172, 173 – Maintenance of case diary mandatory – Police have the power to investigate freely and fairly, in the course of which, it is mandatory to maintain a diary where the day-to-day proceedings are to be recorded with specific mention of time of events, places visited, departure and reporting back, statements recorded, etc – Criminal Court is empowered to summon these diaries u/s 172(2) for purpose of inquiry or trial, s. 173(3) makes it clear that the accused cannot claim any right to peruse them, unless the police themselves, rely on it to refresh their memory or if the court uses it for contradicting the testimony of the police officers. Criminal Trial – Fundamental canons of criminal jurisprudence founded on Arts. 20 and 21 of the Constitution require not just the investigating agency but also courts in their own independent field, to ensure that investigation is fair and does not hamper the individual’s freedom, except in accordance with law, i.e., ensure adherence to the rule of law. Criminal Trial – Practical guidelines to collect mitigating circumstances – Trial Court must elicit information from the accused and the State both – The State must for an offence carrying capital punishment - at the appropriate stage, produce material which is preferably collected beforehand, before the Sessions Court disclosing psychiatric and psychological evaluation of the accused – This will help establish proximity to the accused person’s frame of mind – The State must in a time-bound manner collect additional information pertaining to the accused –Information regarding the accused’s jail conduct and behaviour, activities the accused involved themselves in, and other related details should be called for in the form of a report from the relevant jail authorities. Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 – Sentencing – An effective sentencing hearing to the accused at the relevant stage is a right under s.235(2).",

        "content": "Criminal Trial – Fundamental canons of criminal jurisprudence founded on Arts. 20 and 21 of the Constitution require not just the investigating agency but also courts in their own independent field, to ensure that investigation is fair and does not hamper the individual’s freedom, except in accordance with law, i.e., ensure adherence to the rule of law. Criminal Trial – Practical guidelines to collect mitigating circumstances – Trial Court must elicit information from the accused and the State both – The State must for an offence carrying capital punishment - at the appropriate stage, produce material which is preferably collected beforehand, before the Sessions Court disclosing psychiatric and psychological evaluation of the accused – This will help establish proximity to the accused person’s frame of mind – The State must in a time-bound manner collect additional information pertaining to the accused –Information regarding the accused’s jail conduct and behaviour, activities the accused involved themselves in, and other related details should be called for in the form of a report from the relevant jail authorities. Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 – Sentencing – An effective sentencing hearing to the accused at the relevant stage is a right under s.235(2)."

        "HeadNote": "Contract Act, 1872 – Depositories Act, 1996 – Securities and Exchange Board of India (Depositories and Participants) Regulations, 1996 - Whether the Depositories Act, 1996 read with the Regulation 58 of the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Depositories and Participants) Regulations, 19961 has the legal effect of overwriting the provisions relating to the contracts of pledge under the Indian Contract Act, 1872 and the common law as applicable in India – Held: The Depositories Act prescribes how the dematerialised securities can be pledged – The provisions of the Depositories Act and the 1996 Regulations are not in derogation of the Contract Act but in addition to it – In this regard, reference is made to Section 28 of the Depositories Act – Therefore, the object of the Depositories Act is not to rewrite the provisions of the Contract Act but to regulate the creation and transfer of dematerialised securities – Regulation 38(1)(e) requires a depository to maintain, inter alia, records of all approvals, notices and entries, and cancellation of pledge or hypothecation, as the case may be. Contract Act, 1872 – ss. 148-171, 172-179 – Bailment and Pledge – Legal Distinction – In the cases of bailment, the goods are bailed for specific purpose and once the purpose is accomplished the bailee is bound to deliver the possession of the goods back to the bailor or to dispose off the goods as per the bailor’s direction – Unlike bailment, in pledge there is the delivery of possession of the goods by the pawnor to the pawnee by way of security upon the promise of repayment of a debt or the performance of a promise, thereby creating an estate that vests with the pawnee – Pledge is preceded by bailment Words and Phrases – “Pledge”, “Mortgage” – Movable Property – Legal Distinction – A mortgage conveys the whole legal interest in the chattel, while a pledge conveys only a special property leaving the general property in the pledger, and the pledgee never has absolute ownership of property – Further unlike pledgee, a mortgagee acquires general right in the things mortgaged subject to the right of redemption of the mortgagor – Compared to the pledge, a pawnee has only special right in the goods pledged, namely the right of possession as security and in case of default, he can bring a suit against the pawnor as well as sell the goods after giving a reasonable notice. Contract Act, 1872 – Accretion of the Pawned Goods – Duty of the the Pawnee towards such accretion – The pledge extends to accretions and additions, and therefore, when the pawnee returns the pledged goods, the accretions and additions must be returned to the pawnor – Further it also follows that the pawnee’s right to retain and sell the pledged goods stretches to the right to retain and sell any increase and accumulations to the pledged goods. Contract Act, 1872 – s. 176, 177 – Pawnee’s duty to give notice of intended sale of pawned goods – Extent - Section 176 of the Contract Act, unlike some of the sections of the Contract Act, does not specifically provide that the contractual terms can override the provision by using the expression “in the absence of the contract to the contrary” or “subject to special contract to the contrary” – The notice, that is to be given for the intended sale by the pawnee, is a special protection that the statute has given to the pawnor, and the parties cannot agree that the pawnee may sell the pledged goods without notice to the pledgor – Further, the mere tendering of notice to the pawnor does not binds pawnee to put the intended sale to the effect and he is not bound to sell even after tendering of such notice – If the notice is served, the pawnor may redeem the goods as per s. 177 before the ‘actual sale’ by the pawnee. Contract Act, 1872 – s. 63, 176 – Whether Parties to Pledge Agreement can waive the requirement of Notice As contemplated by s. 176 – Settled Legal position – S. 63 of the Contract Act governs the domain of waiver and it is a general principle of law that everyone has a right to waive the advantage of a law or rule made solely for the benefit and protection of the individual in his private capacity however, such a waiver cannot infringe any public right or public policy – But the requirement of ‘notice’ u/s 176 is a mandatory requirement and a special protection given to the pawnor – S. 176 is not eclipsed or curtailed by the phrase “in the absence of the contract to the contrary” and therefore the parties cannot contract out of Section 176 – Further the need for notice to the pawnor of the intended sale by the pawnee is the special protection given to the pawnor, and the parties cannot override the special protection by agreement. Contract Act, 1872 – Whether a Pawnee can Sell Goods Pledged to ‘Himself’ – Settled Legal Position – It is settled legal position that a pawnee cannot sell goods to himself, and if he does so then such transfer could not be said to be a ‘sale’ but a ‘conversion’ and hence could not interpreted as ‘sale’ in terms of s. 176. Interpretation of Statutes – Rules of Interpretation when two or more than two statutes apply – To resolve a debate when two views are evident, it is best to interpret the provision when we know why the statute is enacted – If a statute is looked at, in the context of its enactment, with the glasses of the statute-maker provided by such context, its scheme, the sections, clauses, phrases and words may take colour and appear different than when the statute is looked at without the glasses provided by the context and this principle may equally apply when we examine interplay between two statutes – Two statutes shall be read together consistently and harmoniously to complement each other so far as it is reasonably possible to do so, and where such conciliation is not possible to clarify the legal position by application of principles of interpretation applicable to such situations. Depositories Act, 1996 – s.2(1)(a), 2(1)(j) – Words and Phrases – “Registered Owner’’, ‘Beneficial Owner’ - Legislative Intent and Purpose - The Depositories Act is enacted to lay down a process and rules for the dematerialization of securities by converting them into electronic data stored in the computers of ‘the depository’ and hence by the aforesaid enactment, the legislature sought to get away with physical security – Further the Depositories Act establishes the depository eco-system and introduces the concepts of a ‘registered owner’ and ‘beneficial owner’ – The depository’ becomes the ‘registered owner’ in respect of the security, whereas the person who surrenders the physical shares is recorded as ‘the beneficial owner’ – Further the beneficial owner’ shall be solely entitled to all rights, benefits, and liabilities attached to the securities held by ‘the depository’. And therefore Power and right to transfer ownership of a dematerialised security vests with the ‘beneficial owner’ same as in the case of buying and selling physical securities. Contract Act, 1872 – s. 176, 177 – Depositories Act, 1996 – s.12 25, 28 – Securities and Exchange Board of India (Depositories and Participants) Regulation 1996 – Regulation 58 – Interplay of The Statutes - In terms of sub-section (1) of Section 12, a ‘beneficial owner’ can create a pledge or hypothecation regarding the security owned by him through ‘the depository’, subject to prior approval of ‘the depository’ but the aforesaid provision nowhere defines the term ‘pledge’ – Section 25 of the Depositories Act, the Securities and Exchange Board of India has been vested with the power to make Regulations to carry out the purpose of the Depositories Act – As per s. 25(2)(d) the regulations may provide for the manner of creating a pledge or hypothecation in respect of a security owned by a ‘beneficial owner’ under sub-section (1) to Section 12 of the Depositories Act – Further as per Regulation 58 a beneficial owner may create a pledge on security owned by him and for this purpose, in cases of Pledge, the pawnee, to exercise the right under s. 12 r/ w Regulation 58, shall, by virtue of Regulation 58(8), get himself recorded as ‘beneficial owner’ before he proceeds to sell the pledged securities – The Acts and the Regulations are not inconsistent but are subject to harmonious construction in order to attain the objective sought to be achieved more so when s. 28 itself provides that “the provisions of this Act shall be in addition to and not in derogation of any other law for the time force relating to the holding and transfer of securities’’ – Further Sections 176 and 177 are not obliterated, in so far as they would equally apply to pawned dematerialised securities as they apply to other pawned goods – Further the requirement of pawnee to get himself registered as ‘beneficial owner’ in in terms of the Act and Regulation, is not an actual sale and would not affect the right of the pawnor of redemption u/s 177 of the Contract Act more so because the pawnee is not getting anything paid against the debt due.",

Contract Act, 1872 – ss. 148-171, 172-179 – Bailment and Pledge – Legal Distinction – In the cases of bailment, the goods are bailed for specific purpose and once the purpose is accomplished the bailee is bound to deliver the possession of the goods back to the bailor or to dispose off the goods as per the bailor’s direction – Unlike bailment, in pledge there is the delivery of possession of the goods by the pawnor to the pawnee by way of security upon the promise of repayment of a debt or the performance of a promise, thereby creating an estate that vests with the pawnee – Pledge is preceded by bailment Words and Phrases – “Pledge”, “Mortgage” – Movable Property – Legal Distinction – A mortgage conveys the whole legal interest in the chattel, while a pledge conveys only a special property leaving the general property in the pledger, and the pledgee never has absolute ownership of property – Further unlike pledgee, a mortgagee acquires general right in the things mortgaged subject to the right of redemption of the mortgagor – Compared to the pledge, a pawnee has only special right in the goods pledged, namely the right of possession as security and in case of default, he can bring a suit against the pawnor as well as sell the goods after giving a reasonable notice. Contract Act, 1872 – Accretion of the Pawned Goods – Duty of the the Pawnee towards such accretion – The pledge extends to accretions and additions, and therefore, when the pawnee returns the pledged goods, the accretions and additions must be returned to the pawnor – Further it also follows that the pawnee’s right to retain and sell the pledged goods stretches to the right to retain and sell any increase and accumulations to the pledged goods. Contract Act, 1872 – s. 176, 177 – Pawnee’s duty to give notice of intended sale of pawned goods – Extent - Section 176 of the Contract Act, unlike some of the sections of the Contract Act, does not specifically provide that the contractual terms can override the provision by using the expression “in the absence of the contract to the contrary” or “subject to special contract to the contrary” – The notice, that is to be given for the intended sale by the pawnee, is a special protection that the statute has given to the pawnor, and the parties cannot agree that the pawnee may sell the pledged goods without notice to the pledgor – Further, the mere tendering of notice to the pawnor does not binds pawnee to put the intended sale to the effect and he is not bound to sell even after tendering of such notice – If the notice is served, the pawnor may redeem the goods as per s. 177 before the ‘actual sale’ by the pawnee. Contract Act, 1872 – s. 63, 176 – Whether Parties to Pledge Agreement can waive the requirement of Notice As contemplated by s. 176 – Settled Legal position – S. 63 of the Contract Act governs the domain of waiver and it is a general principle of law that everyone has a right to waive the advantage of a law or rule made solely for the benefit and protection of the individual in his private capacity however, such a waiver cannot infringe any public right or public policy – But the requirement of ‘notice’ u/s 176 is a mandatory requirement and a special protection given to the pawnor – S. 176 is not eclipsed or curtailed by the phrase “in the absence of the contract to the contrary” and therefore the parties cannot contract out of Section 176 – Further the need for notice to the pawnor of the intended sale by the pawnee is the special protection given to the pawnor, and the parties cannot override the special protection by agreement. Contract Act, 1872 – Whether a Pawnee can Sell Goods Pledged to ‘Himself’ – Settled Legal Position – It is settled legal position that a pawnee cannot sell goods to himself, and if he does so then such transfer could not be said to be a ‘sale’ but a ‘conversion’ and hence could not interpreted as ‘sale’ in terms of s. 176. Interpretation of Statutes – Rules of Interpretation when two or more than two statutes apply – To resolve a debate when two views are evident, it is best to interpret the provision when we know why the statute is enacted – If a statute is looked at, in the context of its enactment, with the glasses of the statute-maker provided by such context, its scheme, the sections, clauses, phrases and words may take colour and appear different than when the statute is looked at without the glasses provided by the context and this principle may equally apply when we examine interplay between two statutes – Two statutes shall be read together consistently and harmoniously to complement each other so far as it is reasonably possible to do so, and where such conciliation is not possible to clarify the legal position by application of principles of interpretation applicable to such situations. Depositories Act, 1996 – s.2(1)(a), 2(1)(j) – Words and Phrases – “Registered Owner’’, ‘Beneficial Owner’ - Legislative Intent and Purpose - The Depositories Act is enacted to lay down a process and rules for the dematerialization of securities by converting them into electronic data stored in the computers of ‘the depository’ and hence by the aforesaid enactment, the legislature sought to get away with physical security – Further the Depositories Act establishes the depository eco-system and introduces the concepts of a ‘registered owner’ and ‘beneficial owner’ – The depository’ becomes the ‘registered owner’ in respect of the security, whereas the person who surrenders the physical shares is recorded as ‘the beneficial owner’ – Further the beneficial owner’ shall be solely entitled to all rights, benefits, and liabilities attached to the securities held by ‘the depository’. And therefore Power and right to transfer ownership of a dematerialised security vests with the ‘beneficial owner’ same as in the case of buying and selling physical securities. Contract Act, 1872 – s. 176, 177 – Depositories Act, 1996 – s.12 25, 28 – Securities and Exchange Board of India (Depositories and Participants) Regulation 1996 – Regulation 58 – Interplay of The Statutes - In terms of sub-section (1) of Section 12, a ‘beneficial owner’ can create a pledge or hypothecation regarding the security owned by him through ‘the depository’, subject to prior approval of ‘the depository’ but the aforesaid provision nowhere defines the term ‘pledge’ – Section 25 of the Depositories Act, the Securities and Exchange Board of India has been vested with the power to make Regulations to carry out the purpose of the Depositories Act – As per s. 25(2)(d) the regulations may provide for the manner of creating a pledge or hypothecation in respect of a security owned by a ‘beneficial owner’ under sub-section (1) to Section 12 of the Depositories Act – Further as per Regulation 58 a beneficial owner may create a pledge on security owned by him and for this purpose, in cases of Pledge, the pawnee, to exercise the right under s. 12 r/ w Regulation 58, shall, by virtue of Regulation 58(8), get himself recorded as ‘beneficial owner’ before he proceeds to sell the pledged securities – The Acts and the Regulations are not inconsistent but are subject to harmonious construction in order to attain the objective sought to be achieved more so when s. 28 itself provides that “the provisions of this Act shall be in addition to and not in derogation of any other law for the time force relating to the holding and transfer of securities’’ – Further Sections 176 and 177 are not obliterated, in so far as they would equally apply to pawned dematerialised securities as they apply to other pawned goods – Further the requirement of pawnee to get himself registered as ‘beneficial owner’ in in terms of the Act and Regulation, is not an actual sale and would not affect the right of the pawnor of redemption u/s 177 of the Contract Act more so because the pawnee is not getting anything paid against the debt due.",

        "HeadNote": "Contract Act, 1872 – Depositories Act, 1996 – Securities and Exchange Board of India (Depositories and Participants) Regulations, 1996 - Whether the Depositories Act, 1996 read with the Regulation 58 of the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Depositories and Participants) Regulations, 19961 has the legal effect of overwriting the provisions relating to the contracts of pledge under the Indian Contract Act, 1872 and the common law as applicable in India – Held: The Depositories Act prescribes how the dematerialised securities can be pledged – The provisions of the Depositories Act and the 1996 Regulations are not in derogation of the Contract Act but in addition to it – In this regard, reference is made to Section 28 of the Depositories Act – Therefore, the object of the Depositories Act is not to rewrite the provisions of the Contract Act but to regulate the creation and transfer of dematerialised securities – Regulation 38(1)(e) requires a depository to maintain, inter alia, records of all approvals, notices and entries, and cancellation of pledge or hypothecation, as the case may be. Contract Act, 1872 – ss. 148-171, 172-179 – Bailment and Pledge – Legal Distinction – In the cases of bailment, the goods are bailed for specific purpose and once the purpose is accomplished the bailee is bound to deliver the possession of the goods back to the bailor or to dispose off the goods as per the bailor’s direction – Unlike bailment, in pledge there is the delivery of possession of the goods by the pawnor to the pawnee by way of security upon the promise of repayment of a debt or the performance of a promise, thereby creating an estate that vests with the pawnee – Pledge is preceded by bailment Words and Phrases – “Pledge”, “Mortgage” – Movable Property – Legal Distinction – A mortgage conveys the whole legal interest in the chattel, while a pledge conveys only a special property leaving the general property in the pledger, and the pledgee never has absolute ownership of property – Further unlike pledgee, a mortgagee acquires general right in the things mortgaged subject to the right of redemption of the mortgagor – Compared to the pledge, a pawnee has only special right in the goods pledged, namely the right of possession as security and in case of default, he can bring a suit against the pawnor as well as sell the goods after giving a reasonable notice. Contract Act, 1872 – Accretion of the Pawned Goods – Duty of the the Pawnee towards such accretion – The pledge extends to accretions and additions, and therefore, when the pawnee returns the pledged goods, the accretions and additions must be returned to the pawnor – Further it also follows that the pawnee’s right to retain and sell the pledged goods stretches to the right to retain and sell any increase and accumulations to the pledged goods. Contract Act, 1872 – s. 176, 177 – Pawnee’s duty to give notice of intended sale of pawned goods – Extent - Section 176 of the Contract Act, unlike some of the sections of the Contract Act, does not specifically provide that the contractual terms can override the provision by using the expression “in the absence of the contract to the contrary” or “subject to special contract to the contrary” – The notice, that is to be given for the intended sale by the pawnee, is a special protection that the statute has given to the pawnor, and the parties cannot agree that the pawnee may sell the pledged goods without notice to the pledgor – Further, the mere tendering of notice to the pawnor does not binds pawnee to put the intended sale to the effect and he is not bound to sell even after tendering of such notice – If the notice is served, the pawnor may redeem the goods as per s. 177 before the ‘actual sale’ by the pawnee. Contract Act, 1872 – s. 63, 176 – Whether Parties to Pledge Agreement can waive the requirement of Notice As contemplated by s. 176 – Settled Legal position – S. 63 of the Contract Act governs the domain of waiver and it is a general principle of law that everyone has a right to waive the advantage of a law or rule made solely for the benefit and protection of the individual in his private capacity however, such a waiver cannot infringe any public right or public policy – But the requirement of ‘notice’ u/s 176 is a mandatory requirement and a special protection given to the pawnor – S. 176 is not eclipsed or curtailed by the phrase “in the absence of the contract to the contrary” and therefore the parties cannot contract out of Section 176 – Further the need for notice to the pawnor of the intended sale by the pawnee is the special protection given to the pawnor, and the parties cannot override the special protection by agreement. Contract Act, 1872 – Whether a Pawnee can Sell Goods Pledged to ‘Himself’ – Settled Legal Position – It is settled legal position that a pawnee cannot sell goods to himself, and if he does so then such transfer could not be said to be a ‘sale’ but a ‘conversion’ and hence could not interpreted as ‘sale’ in terms of s. 176. Interpretation of Statutes – Rules of Interpretation when two or more than two statutes apply – To resolve a debate when two views are evident, it is best to interpret the provision when we know why the statute is enacted – If a statute is looked at, in the context of its enactment, with the glasses of the statute-maker provided by such context, its scheme, the sections, clauses, phrases and words may take colour and appear different than when the statute is looked at without the glasses provided by the context and this principle may equally apply when we examine interplay between two statutes – Two statutes shall be read together consistently and harmoniously to complement each other so far as it is reasonably possible to do so, and where such conciliation is not possible to clarify the legal position by application of principles of interpretation applicable to such situations. Depositories Act, 1996 – s.2(1)(a), 2(1)(j) – Words and Phrases – “Registered Owner’’, ‘Beneficial Owner’ - Legislative Intent and Purpose - The Depositories Act is enacted to lay down a process and rules for the dematerialization of securities by converting them into electronic data stored in the computers of ‘the depository’ and hence by the aforesaid enactment, the legislature sought to get away with physical security – Further the Depositories Act establishes the depository eco-system and introduces the concepts of a ‘registered owner’ and ‘beneficial owner’ – The depository’ becomes the ‘registered owner’ in respect of the security, whereas the person who surrenders the physical shares is recorded as ‘the beneficial owner’ – Further the beneficial owner’ shall be solely entitled to all rights, benefits, and liabilities attached to the securities held by ‘the depository’. And therefore Power and right to transfer ownership of a dematerialised security vests with the ‘beneficial owner’ same as in the case of buying and selling physical securities. Contract Act, 1872 – s. 176, 177 – Depositories Act, 1996 – s.12 25, 28 – Securities and Exchange Board of India (Depositories and Participants) Regulation 1996 – Regulation 58 – Interplay of The Statutes - In terms of sub-section (1) of Section 12, a ‘beneficial owner’ can create a pledge or hypothecation regarding the security owned by him through ‘the depository’, subject to prior approval of ‘the depository’ but the aforesaid provision nowhere defines the term ‘pledge’ – Section 25 of the Depositories Act, the Securities and Exchange Board of India has been vested with the power to make Regulations to carry out the purpose of the Depositories Act – As per s. 25(2)(d) the regulations may provide for the manner of creating a pledge or hypothecation in respect of a security owned by a ‘beneficial owner’ under sub-section (1) to Section 12 of the Depositories Act – Further as per Regulation 58 a beneficial owner may create a pledge on security owned by him and for this purpose, in cases of Pledge, the pawnee, to exercise the right under s. 12 r/ w Regulation 58, shall, by virtue of Regulation 58(8), get himself recorded as ‘beneficial owner’ before he proceeds to sell the pledged securities – The Acts and the Regulations are not inconsistent but are subject to harmonious construction in order to attain the objective sought to be achieved more so when s. 28 itself provides that “the provisions of this Act shall be in addition to and not in derogation of any other law for the time force relating to the holding and transfer of securities’’ – Further Sections 176 and 177 are not obliterated, in so far as they would equally apply to pawned dematerialised securities as they apply to other pawned goods – Further the requirement of pawnee to get himself registered as ‘beneficial owner’ in in terms of the Act and Regulation, is not an actual sale and would not affect the right of the pawnor of redemption u/s 177 of the Contract Act more so because the pawnee is not getting anything paid against the debt due.",

        "HeadNote": "Contract Act, 1872 – Depositories Act, 1996 – Securities and Exchange Board of India (Depositories and Participants) Regulations, 1996 - Whether the Depositories Act, 1996 read with the Regulation 58 of the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Depositories and Participants) Regulations, 19961 has the legal effect of overwriting the provisions relating to the contracts of pledge under the Indian Contract Act, 1872 and the common law as applicable in India – Held: The Depositories Act prescribes how the dematerialised securities can be pledged – The provisions of the Depositories Act and the 1996 Regulations are not in derogation of the Contract Act but in addition to it – In this regard, reference is made to Section 28 of the Depositories Act – Therefore, the object of the Depositories Act is not to rewrite the provisions of the Contract Act but to regulate the creation and transfer of dematerialised securities – Regulation 38(1)(e) requires a depository to maintain, inter alia, records of all approvals, notices and entries, and cancellation of pledge or hypothecation, as the case may be. Contract Act, 1872 – ss. 148-171, 172-179 – Bailment and Pledge – Legal Distinction – In the cases of bailment, the goods are bailed for specific purpose and once the purpose is accomplished the bailee is bound to deliver the possession of the goods back to the bailor or to dispose off the goods as per the bailor’s direction – Unlike bailment, in pledge there is the delivery of possession of the goods by the pawnor to the pawnee by way of security upon the promise of repayment of a debt or the performance of a promise, thereby creating an estate that vests with the pawnee – Pledge is preceded by bailment Words and Phrases – “Pledge”, “Mortgage” – Movable Property – Legal Distinction – A mortgage conveys the whole legal interest in the chattel, while a pledge conveys only a special property leaving the general property in the pledger, and the pledgee never has absolute ownership of property – Further unlike pledgee, a mortgagee acquires general right in the things mortgaged subject to the right of redemption of the mortgagor – Compared to the pledge, a pawnee has only special right in the goods pledged, namely the right of possession as security and in case of default, he can bring a suit against the pawnor as well as sell the goods after giving a reasonable notice. Contract Act, 1872 – Accretion of the Pawned Goods – Duty of the the Pawnee towards such accretion – The pledge extends to accretions and additions, and therefore, when the pawnee returns the pledged goods, the accretions and additions must be returned to the pawnor – Further it also follows that the pawnee’s right to retain and sell the pledged goods stretches to the right to retain and sell any increase and accumulations to the pledged goods. Contract Act, 1872 – s. 176, 177 – Pawnee’s duty to give notice of intended sale of pawned goods – Extent - Section 176 of the Contract Act, unlike some of the sections of the Contract Act, does not specifically provide that the contractual terms can override the provision by using the expression “in the absence of the contract to the contrary” or “subject to special contract to the contrary” – The notice, that is to be given for the intended sale by the pawnee, is a special protection that the statute has given to the pawnor, and the parties cannot agree that the pawnee may sell the pledged goods without notice to the pledgor – Further, the mere tendering of notice to the pawnor does not binds pawnee to put the intended sale to the effect and he is not bound to sell even after tendering of such notice – If the notice is served, the pawnor may redeem the goods as per s. 177 before the ‘actual sale’ by the pawnee. Contract Act, 1872 – s. 63, 176 – Whether Parties to Pledge Agreement can waive the requirement of Notice As contemplated by s. 176 – Settled Legal position – S. 63 of the Contract Act governs the domain of waiver and it is a general principle of law that everyone has a right to waive the advantage of a law or rule made solely for the benefit and protection of the individual in his private capacity however, such a waiver cannot infringe any public right or public policy – But the requirement of ‘notice’ u/s 176 is a mandatory requirement and a special protection given to the pawnor – S. 176 is not eclipsed or curtailed by the phrase “in the absence of the contract to the contrary” and therefore the parties cannot contract out of Section 176 – Further the need for notice to the pawnor of the intended sale by the pawnee is the special protection given to the pawnor, and the parties cannot override the special protection by agreement. Contract Act, 1872 – Whether a Pawnee can Sell Goods Pledged to ‘Himself’ – Settled Legal Position – It is settled legal position that a pawnee cannot sell goods to himself, and if he does so then such transfer could not be said to be a ‘sale’ but a ‘conversion’ and hence could not interpreted as ‘sale’ in terms of s. 176. Interpretation of Statutes – Rules of Interpretation when two or more than two statutes apply – To resolve a debate when two views are evident, it is best to interpret the provision when we know why the statute is enacted – If a statute is looked at, in the context of its enactment, with the glasses of the statute-maker provided by such context, its scheme, the sections, clauses, phrases and words may take colour and appear different than when the statute is looked at without the glasses provided by the context and this principle may equally apply when we examine interplay between two statutes – Two statutes shall be read together consistently and harmoniously to complement each other so far as it is reasonably possible to do so, and where such conciliation is not possible to clarify the legal position by application of principles of interpretation applicable to such situations. Depositories Act, 1996 – s.2(1)(a), 2(1)(j) – Words and Phrases – “Registered Owner’’, ‘Beneficial Owner’ - Legislative Intent and Purpose - The Depositories Act is enacted to lay down a process and rules for the dematerialization of securities by converting them into electronic data stored in the computers of ‘the depository’ and hence by the aforesaid enactment, the legislature sought to get away with physical security – Further the Depositories Act establishes the depository eco-system and introduces the concepts of a ‘registered owner’ and ‘beneficial owner’ – The depository’ becomes the ‘registered owner’ in respect of the security, whereas the person who surrenders the physical shares is recorded as ‘the beneficial owner’ – Further the beneficial owner’ shall be solely entitled to all rights, benefits, and liabilities attached to the securities held by ‘the depository’. And therefore Power and right to transfer ownership of a dematerialised security vests with the ‘beneficial owner’ same as in the case of buying and selling physical securities. Contract Act, 1872 – s. 176, 177 – Depositories Act, 1996 – s.12 25, 28 – Securities and Exchange Board of India (Depositories and Participants) Regulation 1996 – Regulation 58 – Interplay of The Statutes - In terms of sub-section (1) of Section 12, a ‘beneficial owner’ can create a pledge or hypothecation regarding the security owned by him through ‘the depository’, subject to prior approval of ‘the depository’ but the aforesaid provision nowhere defines the term ‘pledge’ – Section 25 of the Depositories Act, the Securities and Exchange Board of India has been vested with the power to make Regulations to carry out the purpose of the Depositories Act – As per s. 25(2)(d) the regulations may provide for the manner of creating a pledge or hypothecation in respect of a security owned by a ‘beneficial owner’ under sub-section (1) to Section 12 of the Depositories Act – Further as per Regulation 58 a beneficial owner may create a pledge on security owned by him and for this purpose, in cases of Pledge, the pawnee, to exercise the right under s. 12 r/ w Regulation 58, shall, by virtue of Regulation 58(8), get himself recorded as ‘beneficial owner’ before he proceeds to sell the pledged securities – The Acts and the Regulations are not inconsistent but are subject to harmonious construction in order to attain the objective sought to be achieved more so when s. 28 itself provides that “the provisions of this Act shall be in addition to and not in derogation of any other law for the time force relating to the holding and transfer of securities’’ – Further Sections 176 and 177 are not obliterated, in so far as they would equally apply to pawned dematerialised securities as they apply to other pawned goods – Further the requirement of pawnee to get himself registered as ‘beneficial owner’ in in terms of the Act and Regulation, is not an actual sale and would not affect the right of the pawnor of redemption u/s 177 of the Contract Act more so because the pawnee is not getting anything paid against the debt due.",

        "HeadNote": "Contract Act, 1872 – Depositories Act, 1996 – Securities and Exchange Board of India (Depositories and Participants) Regulations, 1996 - Whether the Depositories Act, 1996 read with the Regulation 58 of the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Depositories and Participants) Regulations, 19961 has the legal effect of overwriting the provisions relating to the contracts of pledge under the Indian Contract Act, 1872 and the common law as applicable in India – Held: The Depositories Act prescribes how the dematerialised securities can be pledged – The provisions of the Depositories Act and the 1996 Regulations are not in derogation of the Contract Act but in addition to it – In this regard, reference is made to Section 28 of the Depositories Act – Therefore, the object of the Depositories Act is not to rewrite the provisions of the Contract Act but to regulate the creation and transfer of dematerialised securities – Regulation 38(1)(e) requires a depository to maintain, inter alia, records of all approvals, notices and entries, and cancellation of pledge or hypothecation, as the case may be. Contract Act, 1872 – ss. 148-171, 172-179 – Bailment and Pledge – Legal Distinction – In the cases of bailment, the goods are bailed for specific purpose and once the purpose is accomplished the bailee is bound to deliver the possession of the goods back to the bailor or to dispose off the goods as per the bailor’s direction – Unlike bailment, in pledge there is the delivery of possession of the goods by the pawnor to the pawnee by way of security upon the promise of repayment of a debt or the performance of a promise, thereby creating an estate that vests with the pawnee – Pledge is preceded by bailment Words and Phrases – “Pledge”, “Mortgage” – Movable Property – Legal Distinction – A mortgage conveys the whole legal interest in the chattel, while a pledge conveys only a special property leaving the general property in the pledger, and the pledgee never has absolute ownership of property – Further unlike pledgee, a mortgagee acquires general right in the things mortgaged subject to the right of redemption of the mortgagor – Compared to the pledge, a pawnee has only special right in the goods pledged, namely the right of possession as security and in case of default, he can bring a suit against the pawnor as well as sell the goods after giving a reasonable notice. Contract Act, 1872 – Accretion of the Pawned Goods – Duty of the the Pawnee towards such accretion – The pledge extends to accretions and additions, and therefore, when the pawnee returns the pledged goods, the accretions and additions must be returned to the pawnor – Further it also follows that the pawnee’s right to retain and sell the pledged goods stretches to the right to retain and sell any increase and accumulations to the pledged goods. Contract Act, 1872 – s. 176, 177 – Pawnee’s duty to give notice of intended sale of pawned goods – Extent - Section 176 of the Contract Act, unlike some of the sections of the Contract Act, does not specifically provide that the contractual terms can override the provision by using the expression “in the absence of the contract to the contrary” or “subject to special contract to the contrary” – The notice, that is to be given for the intended sale by the pawnee, is a special protection that the statute has given to the pawnor, and the parties cannot agree that the pawnee may sell the pledged goods without notice to the pledgor – Further, the mere tendering of notice to the pawnor does not binds pawnee to put the intended sale to the effect and he is not bound to sell even after tendering of such notice – If the notice is served, the pawnor may redeem the goods as per s. 177 before the ‘actual sale’ by the pawnee. Contract Act, 1872 – s. 63, 176 – Whether Parties to Pledge Agreement can waive the requirement of Notice As contemplated by s. 176 – Settled Legal position – S. 63 of the Contract Act governs the domain of waiver and it is a general principle of law that everyone has a right to waive the advantage of a law or rule made solely for the benefit and protection of the individual in his private capacity however, such a waiver cannot infringe any public right or public policy – But the requirement of ‘notice’ u/s 176 is a mandatory requirement and a special protection given to the pawnor – S. 176 is not eclipsed or curtailed by the phrase “in the absence of the contract to the contrary” and therefore the parties cannot contract out of Section 176 – Further the need for notice to the pawnor of the intended sale by the pawnee is the special protection given to the pawnor, and the parties cannot override the special protection by agreement. Contract Act, 1872 – Whether a Pawnee can Sell Goods Pledged to ‘Himself’ – Settled Legal Position – It is settled legal position that a pawnee cannot sell goods to himself, and if he does so then such transfer could not be said to be a ‘sale’ but a ‘conversion’ and hence could not interpreted as ‘sale’ in terms of s. 176. Interpretation of Statutes – Rules of Interpretation when two or more than two statutes apply – To resolve a debate when two views are evident, it is best to interpret the provision when we know why the statute is enacted – If a statute is looked at, in the context of its enactment, with the glasses of the statute-maker provided by such context, its scheme, the sections, clauses, phrases and words may take colour and appear different than when the statute is looked at without the glasses provided by the context and this principle may equally apply when we examine interplay between two statutes – Two statutes shall be read together consistently and harmoniously to complement each other so far as it is reasonably possible to do so, and where such conciliation is not possible to clarify the legal position by application of principles of interpretation applicable to such situations. Depositories Act, 1996 – s.2(1)(a), 2(1)(j) – Words and Phrases – “Registered Owner’’, ‘Beneficial Owner’ - Legislative Intent and Purpose - The Depositories Act is enacted to lay down a process and rules for the dematerialization of securities by converting them into electronic data stored in the computers of ‘the depository’ and hence by the aforesaid enactment, the legislature sought to get away with physical security – Further the Depositories Act establishes the depository eco-system and introduces the concepts of a ‘registered owner’ and ‘beneficial owner’ – The depository’ becomes the ‘registered owner’ in respect of the security, whereas the person who surrenders the physical shares is recorded as ‘the beneficial owner’ – Further the beneficial owner’ shall be solely entitled to all rights, benefits, and liabilities attached to the securities held by ‘the depository’. And therefore Power and right to transfer ownership of a dematerialised security vests with the ‘beneficial owner’ same as in the case of buying and selling physical securities. Contract Act, 1872 – s. 176, 177 – Depositories Act, 1996 – s.12 25, 28 – Securities and Exchange Board of India (Depositories and Participants) Regulation 1996 – Regulation 58 – Interplay of The Statutes - In terms of sub-section (1) of Section 12, a ‘beneficial owner’ can create a pledge or hypothecation regarding the security owned by him through ‘the depository’, subject to prior approval of ‘the depository’ but the aforesaid provision nowhere defines the term ‘pledge’ – Section 25 of the Depositories Act, the Securities and Exchange Board of India has been vested with the power to make Regulations to carry out the purpose of the Depositories Act – As per s. 25(2)(d) the regulations may provide for the manner of creating a pledge or hypothecation in respect of a security owned by a ‘beneficial owner’ under sub-section (1) to Section 12 of the Depositories Act – Further as per Regulation 58 a beneficial owner may create a pledge on security owned by him and for this purpose, in cases of Pledge, the pawnee, to exercise the right under s. 12 r/ w Regulation 58, shall, by virtue of Regulation 58(8), get himself recorded as ‘beneficial owner’ before he proceeds to sell the pledged securities – The Acts and the Regulations are not inconsistent but are subject to harmonious construction in order to attain the objective sought to be achieved more so when s. 28 itself provides that “the provisions of this Act shall be in addition to and not in derogation of any other law for the time force relating to the holding and transfer of securities’’ – Further Sections 176 and 177 are not obliterated, in so far as they would equally apply to pawned dematerialised securities as they apply to other pawned goods – Further the requirement of pawnee to get himself registered as ‘beneficial owner’ in in terms of the Act and Regulation, is not an actual sale and would not affect the right of the pawnor of redemption u/s 177 of the Contract Act more so because the pawnee is not getting anything paid against the debt due.",

Contract Act, 1872 – ss. 148-171, 172-179 – Bailment and Pledge – Legal Distinction – In the cases of bailment, the goods are bailed for specific purpose and once the purpose is accomplished the bailee is bound to deliver the possession of the goods back to the bailor or to dispose off the goods as per the bailor’s direction – Unlike bailment, in pledge there is the delivery of possession of the goods by the pawnor to the pawnee by way of security upon the promise of repayment of a debt or the performance of a promise, thereby creating an estate that vests with the pawnee – Pledge is preceded by bailment Words and Phrases – “Pledge”, “Mortgage” – Movable Property – Legal Distinction – A mortgage conveys the whole legal interest in the chattel, while a pledge conveys only a special property leaving the general property in the pledger, and the pledgee never has absolute ownership of property – Further unlike pledgee, a mortgagee acquires general right in the things mortgaged subject to the right of redemption of the mortgagor – Compared to the pledge, a pawnee has only special right in the goods pledged, namely the right of possession as security and in case of default, he can bring a suit against the pawnor as well as sell the goods after giving a reasonable notice. Contract Act, 1872 – Accretion of the Pawned Goods – Duty of the the Pawnee towards such accretion – The pledge extends to accretions and additions, and therefore, when the pawnee returns the pledged goods, the accretions and additions must be returned to the pawnor – Further it also follows that the pawnee’s right to retain and sell the pledged goods stretches to the right to retain and sell any increase and accumulations to the pledged goods. Contract Act, 1872 – s. 176, 177 – Pawnee’s duty to give notice of intended sale of pawned goods – Extent - Section 176 of the Contract Act, unlike some of the sections of the Contract Act, does not specifically provide that the contractual terms can override the provision by using the expression “in the absence of the contract to the contrary” or “subject to special contract to the contrary” – The notice, that is to be given for the intended sale by the pawnee, is a special protection that the statute has given to the pawnor, and the parties cannot agree that the pawnee may sell the pledged goods without notice to the pledgor – Further, the mere tendering of notice to the pawnor does not binds pawnee to put the intended sale to the effect and he is not bound to sell even after tendering of such notice – If the notice is served, the pawnor may redeem the goods as per s. 177 before the ‘actual sale’ by the pawnee. Contract Act, 1872 – s. 63, 176 – Whether Parties to Pledge Agreement can waive the requirement of Notice As contemplated by s. 176 – Settled Legal position – S. 63 of the Contract Act governs the domain of waiver and it is a general principle of law that everyone has a right to waive the advantage of a law or rule made solely for the benefit and protection of the individual in his private capacity however, such a waiver cannot infringe any public right or public policy – But the requirement of ‘notice’ u/s 176 is a mandatory requirement and a special protection given to the pawnor – S. 176 is not eclipsed or curtailed by the phrase “in the absence of the contract to the contrary” and therefore the parties cannot contract out of Section 176 – Further the need for notice to the pawnor of the intended sale by the pawnee is the special protection given to the pawnor, and the parties cannot override the special protection by agreement. Contract Act, 1872 – Whether a Pawnee can Sell Goods Pledged to ‘Himself’ – Settled Legal Position – It is settled legal position that a pawnee cannot sell goods to himself, and if he does so then such transfer could not be said to be a ‘sale’ but a ‘conversion’ and hence could not interpreted as ‘sale’ in terms of s. 176. Interpretation of Statutes – Rules of Interpretation when two or more than two statutes apply – To resolve a debate when two views are evident, it is best to interpret the provision when we know why the statute is enacted – If a statute is looked at, in the context of its enactment, with the glasses of the statute-maker provided by such context, its scheme, the sections, clauses, phrases and words may take colour and appear different than when the statute is looked at without the glasses provided by the context and this principle may equally apply when we examine interplay between two statutes – Two statutes shall be read together consistently and harmoniously to complement each other so far as it is reasonably possible to do so, and where such conciliation is not possible to clarify the legal position by application of principles of interpretation applicable to such situations. Depositories Act, 1996 – s.2(1)(a), 2(1)(j) – Words and Phrases – “Registered Owner’’, ‘Beneficial Owner’ - Legislative Intent and Purpose - The Depositories Act is enacted to lay down a process and rules for the dematerialization of securities by converting them into electronic data stored in the computers of ‘the depository’ and hence by the aforesaid enactment, the legislature sought to get away with physical security – Further the Depositories Act establishes the depository eco-system and introduces the concepts of a ‘registered owner’ and ‘beneficial owner’ – The depository’ becomes the ‘registered owner’ in respect of the security, whereas the person who surrenders the physical shares is recorded as ‘the beneficial owner’ – Further the beneficial owner’ shall be solely entitled to all rights, benefits, and liabilities attached to the securities held by ‘the depository’. And therefore Power and right to transfer ownership of a dematerialised security vests with the ‘beneficial owner’ same as in the case of buying and selling physical securities. Contract Act, 1872 – s. 176, 177 – Depositories Act, 1996 – s.12 25, 28 – Securities and Exchange Board of India (Depositories and Participants) Regulation 1996 – Regulation 58 – Interplay of The Statutes - In terms of sub-section (1) of Section 12, a ‘beneficial owner’ can create a pledge or hypothecation regarding the security owned by him through ‘the depository’, subject to prior approval of ‘the depository’ but the aforesaid provision nowhere defines the term ‘pledge’ – Section 25 of the Depositories Act, the Securities and Exchange Board of India has been vested with the power to make Regulations to carry out the purpose of the Depositories Act – As per s. 25(2)(d) the regulations may provide for the manner of creating a pledge or hypothecation in respect of a security owned by a ‘beneficial owner’ under sub-section (1) to Section 12 of the Depositories Act – Further as per Regulation 58 a beneficial owner may create a pledge on security owned by him and for this purpose, in cases of Pledge, the pawnee, to exercise the right under s. 12 r/ w Regulation 58, shall, by virtue of Regulation 58(8), get himself recorded as ‘beneficial owner’ before he proceeds to sell the pledged securities – The Acts and the Regulations are not inconsistent but are subject to harmonious construction in order to attain the objective sought to be achieved more so when s. 28 itself provides that “the provisions of this Act shall be in addition to and not in derogation of any other law for the time force relating to the holding and transfer of securities’’ – Further Sections 176 and 177 are not obliterated, in so far as they would equally apply to pawned dematerialised securities as they apply to other pawned goods – Further the requirement of pawnee to get himself registered as ‘beneficial owner’ in in terms of the Act and Regulation, is not an actual sale and would not affect the right of the pawnor of redemption u/s 177 of the Contract Act more so because the pawnee is not getting anything paid against the debt due.",

Contract Act, 1872 – Whether a Pawnee can Sell Goods Pledged to ‘Himself’ – Settled Legal Position – It is settled legal position that a pawnee cannot sell goods to himself, and if he does so then such transfer could not be said to be a ‘sale’ but a ‘conversion’ and hence could not interpreted as ‘sale’ in terms of s. 176. Interpretation of Statutes – Rules of Interpretation when two or more than two statutes apply – To resolve a debate when two views are evident, it is best to interpret the provision when we know why the statute is enacted – If a statute is looked at, in the context of its enactment, with the glasses of the statute-maker provided by such context, its scheme, the sections, clauses, phrases and words may take colour and appear different than when the statute is looked at without the glasses provided by the context and this principle may equally apply when we examine interplay between two statutes – Two statutes shall be read together consistently and harmoniously to complement each other so far as it is reasonably possible to do so, and where such conciliation is not possible to clarify the legal position by application of principles of interpretation applicable to such situations. Depositories Act, 1996 – s.2(1)(a), 2(1)(j) – Words and Phrases – “Registered Owner’’, ‘Beneficial Owner’ - Legislative Intent and Purpose - The Depositories Act is enacted to lay down a process and rules for the dematerialization of securities by converting them into electronic data stored in the computers of ‘the depository’ and hence by the aforesaid enactment, the legislature sought to get away with physical security – Further the Depositories Act establishes the depository eco-system and introduces the concepts of a ‘registered owner’ and ‘beneficial owner’ – The depository’ becomes the ‘registered owner’ in respect of the security, whereas the person who surrenders the physical shares is recorded as ‘the beneficial owner’ – Further the beneficial owner’ shall be solely entitled to all rights, benefits, and liabilities attached to the securities held by ‘the depository’. And therefore Power and right to transfer ownership of a dematerialised security vests with the ‘beneficial owner’ same as in the case of buying and selling physical securities. Contract Act, 1872 – s. 176, 177 – Depositories Act, 1996 – s.12 25, 28 – Securities and Exchange Board of India (Depositories and Participants) Regulation 1996 – Regulation 58 – Interplay of The Statutes - In terms of sub-section (1) of Section 12, a ‘beneficial owner’ can create a pledge or hypothecation regarding the security owned by him through ‘the depository’, subject to prior approval of ‘the depository’ but the aforesaid provision nowhere defines the term ‘pledge’ – Section 25 of the Depositories Act, the Securities and Exchange Board of India has been vested with the power to make Regulations to carry out the purpose of the Depositories Act – As per s. 25(2)(d) the regulations may provide for the manner of creating a pledge or hypothecation in respect of a security owned by a ‘beneficial owner’ under sub-section (1) to Section 12 of the Depositories Act – Further as per Regulation 58 a beneficial owner may create a pledge on security owned by him and for this purpose, in cases of Pledge, the pawnee, to exercise the right under s. 12 r/ w Regulation 58, shall, by virtue of Regulation 58(8), get himself recorded as ‘beneficial owner’ before he proceeds to sell the pledged securities – The Acts and the Regulations are not inconsistent but are subject to harmonious construction in order to attain the objective sought to be achieved more so when s. 28 itself provides that “the provisions of this Act shall be in addition to and not in derogation of any other law for the time force relating to the holding and transfer of securities’’ – Further Sections 176 and 177 are not obliterated, in so far as they would equally apply to pawned dematerialised securities as they apply to other pawned goods – Further the requirement of pawnee to get himself registered as ‘beneficial owner’ in in terms of the Act and Regulation, is not an actual sale and would not affect the right of the pawnor of redemption u/s 177 of the Contract Act more so because the pawnee is not getting anything paid against the debt due.",

        "HeadNote": "Contract Act, 1872 – Depositories Act, 1996 – Securities and Exchange Board of India (Depositories and Participants) Regulations, 1996 - Whether the Depositories Act, 1996 read with the Regulation 58 of the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Depositories and Participants) Regulations, 19961 has the legal effect of overwriting the provisions relating to the contracts of pledge under the Indian Contract Act, 1872 and the common law as applicable in India – Held: The Depositories Act prescribes how the dematerialised securities can be pledged – The provisions of the Depositories Act and the 1996 Regulations are not in derogation of the Contract Act but in addition to it – In this regard, reference is made to Section 28 of the Depositories Act – Therefore, the object of the Depositories Act is not to rewrite the provisions of the Contract Act but to regulate the creation and transfer of dematerialised securities – Regulation 38(1)(e) requires a depository to maintain, inter alia, records of all approvals, notices and entries, and cancellation of pledge or hypothecation, as the case may be. Contract Act, 1872 – ss. 148-171, 172-179 – Bailment and Pledge – Legal Distinction – In the cases of bailment, the goods are bailed for specific purpose and once the purpose is accomplished the bailee is bound to deliver the possession of the goods back to the bailor or to dispose off the goods as per the bailor’s direction – Unlike bailment, in pledge there is the delivery of possession of the goods by the pawnor to the pawnee by way of security upon the promise of repayment of a debt or the performance of a promise, thereby creating an estate that vests with the pawnee – Pledge is preceded by bailment Words and Phrases – “Pledge”, “Mortgage” – Movable Property – Legal Distinction – A mortgage conveys the whole legal interest in the chattel, while a pledge conveys only a special property leaving the general property in the pledger, and the pledgee never has absolute ownership of property – Further unlike pledgee, a mortgagee acquires general right in the things mortgaged subject to the right of redemption of the mortgagor – Compared to the pledge, a pawnee has only special right in the goods pledged, namely the right of possession as security and in case of default, he can bring a suit against the pawnor as well as sell the goods after giving a reasonable notice. Contract Act, 1872 – Accretion of the Pawned Goods – Duty of the the Pawnee towards such accretion – The pledge extends to accretions and additions, and therefore, when the pawnee returns the pledged goods, the accretions and additions must be returned to the pawnor – Further it also follows that the pawnee’s right to retain and sell the pledged goods stretches to the right to retain and sell any increase and accumulations to the pledged goods. Contract Act, 1872 – s. 176, 177 – Pawnee’s duty to give notice of intended sale of pawned goods – Extent - Section 176 of the Contract Act, unlike some of the sections of the Contract Act, does not specifically provide that the contractual terms can override the provision by using the expression “in the absence of the contract to the contrary” or “subject to special contract to the contrary” – The notice, that is to be given for the intended sale by the pawnee, is a special protection that the statute has given to the pawnor, and the parties cannot agree that the pawnee may sell the pledged goods without notice to the pledgor – Further, the mere tendering of notice to the pawnor does not binds pawnee to put the intended sale to the effect and he is not bound to sell even after tendering of such notice – If the notice is served, the pawnor may redeem the goods as per s. 177 before the ‘actual sale’ by the pawnee. Contract Act, 1872 – s. 63, 176 – Whether Parties to Pledge Agreement can waive the requirement of Notice As contemplated by s. 176 – Settled Legal position – S. 63 of the Contract Act governs the domain of waiver and it is a general principle of law that everyone has a right to waive the advantage of a law or rule made solely for the benefit and protection of the individual in his private capacity however, such a waiver cannot infringe any public right or public policy – But the requirement of ‘notice’ u/s 176 is a mandatory requirement and a special protection given to the pawnor – S. 176 is not eclipsed or curtailed by the phrase “in the absence of the contract to the contrary” and therefore the parties cannot contract out of Section 176 – Further the need for notice to the pawnor of the intended sale by the pawnee is the special protection given to the pawnor, and the parties cannot override the special protection by agreement. Contract Act, 1872 – Whether a Pawnee can Sell Goods Pledged to ‘Himself’ – Settled Legal Position – It is settled legal position that a pawnee cannot sell goods to himself, and if he does so then such transfer could not be said to be a ‘sale’ but a ‘conversion’ and hence could not interpreted as ‘sale’ in terms of s. 176. Interpretation of Statutes – Rules of Interpretation when two or more than two statutes apply – To resolve a debate when two views are evident, it is best to interpret the provision when we know why the statute is enacted – If a statute is looked at, in the context of its enactment, with the glasses of the statute-maker provided by such context, its scheme, the sections, clauses, phrases and words may take colour and appear different than when the statute is looked at without the glasses provided by the context and this principle may equally apply when we examine interplay between two statutes – Two statutes shall be read together consistently and harmoniously to complement each other so far as it is reasonably possible to do so, and where such conciliation is not possible to clarify the legal position by application of principles of interpretation applicable to such situations. Depositories Act, 1996 – s.2(1)(a), 2(1)(j) – Words and Phrases – “Registered Owner’’, ‘Beneficial Owner’ - Legislative Intent and Purpose - The Depositories Act is enacted to lay down a process and rules for the dematerialization of securities by converting them into electronic data stored in the computers of ‘the depository’ and hence by the aforesaid enactment, the legislature sought to get away with physical security – Further the Depositories Act establishes the depository eco-system and introduces the concepts of a ‘registered owner’ and ‘beneficial owner’ – The depository’ becomes the ‘registered owner’ in respect of the security, whereas the person who surrenders the physical shares is recorded as ‘the beneficial owner’ – Further the beneficial owner’ shall be solely entitled to all rights, benefits, and liabilities attached to the securities held by ‘the depository’. And therefore Power and right to transfer ownership of a dematerialised security vests with the ‘beneficial owner’ same as in the case of buying and selling physical securities. Contract Act, 1872 – s. 176, 177 – Depositories Act, 1996 – s.12 25, 28 – Securities and Exchange Board of India (Depositories and Participants) Regulation 1996 – Regulation 58 – Interplay of The Statutes - In terms of sub-section (1) of Section 12, a ‘beneficial owner’ can create a pledge or hypothecation regarding the security owned by him through ‘the depository’, subject to prior approval of ‘the depository’ but the aforesaid provision nowhere defines the term ‘pledge’ – Section 25 of the Depositories Act, the Securities and Exchange Board of India has been vested with the power to make Regulations to carry out the purpose of the Depositories Act – As per s. 25(2)(d) the regulations may provide for the manner of creating a pledge or hypothecation in respect of a security owned by a ‘beneficial owner’ under sub-section (1) to Section 12 of the Depositories Act – Further as per Regulation 58 a beneficial owner may create a pledge on security owned by him and for this purpose, in cases of Pledge, the pawnee, to exercise the right under s. 12 r/ w Regulation 58, shall, by virtue of Regulation 58(8), get himself recorded as ‘beneficial owner’ before he proceeds to sell the pledged securities – The Acts and the Regulations are not inconsistent but are subject to harmonious construction in order to attain the objective sought to be achieved more so when s. 28 itself provides that “the provisions of this Act shall be in addition to and not in derogation of any other law for the time force relating to the holding and transfer of securities’’ – Further Sections 176 and 177 are not obliterated, in so far as they would equally apply to pawned dematerialised securities as they apply to other pawned goods – Further the requirement of pawnee to get himself registered as ‘beneficial owner’ in in terms of the Act and Regulation, is not an actual sale and would not affect the right of the pawnor of redemption u/s 177 of the Contract Act more so because the pawnee is not getting anything paid against the debt due.",

        "HeadNote": "Constitution of India – Articles 246A and 279A – Constitution (One Hundred and First Amendment Act) 2016 – Central Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017 – Integrated Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017 – Recommendations of Goods and Services Tax Council – Nature of – Held: Recommendations of the GST Council are not binding on the Union and States – Deletion of Art. 279B and the inclusion of Art. 279(1) by the Constitution Amendment Act 2016 indicates that the Parliament intended for the recommendations of the GST Council to only have a persuasive value, particularly when interpreted along with the objective of the GST regime to foster cooperative federalism and harmony between the constituent units – Neither does Art. 279A begin with a non-obstante clause nor does Article 246A state that it is subject to the provisions of Article 279A – Parliament and the State legislatures possess simultaneous power to legislate on GST – Art. 246A does not envisage a repugnancy provision to resolve the inconsistencies between the Central and the State laws on GST – The ‘recommendations’ of the GST Council are the product of a collaborative dialogue involving the Union and States – They are recommendatory in nature – To regard them as binding edicts would disrupt fiscal federalism, where both the Union and the States are conferred equal power to legislate on GST – Government while exercising its rule-making power under the provisions of the CGST Act and IGST Act is bound by the recommendations of the GST Council – However, that does not mean that all the recommendations of the GST Council made by virtue of the power Art. 279A (4) are binding on the legislature’s power to enact primary legislations. Constitution of India – Constitution (One Hundred and First Amendment Act) 2016 – Articles 246 A and 279A – Central Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017 – ss.2(30), 2(93), 8 – Integrated Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017 – ss.2(11), 5(3), 13(9) – Impugned notifications (Notification 8/2017 and 10/2017) issued by Central Government on the advice of the GST Council levied an integrated tax at the rate of 5 per cent on the supply of specified services, including transportation of goods, in a vessel from a place outside India up to the customs station of clearance in India and categorized the recipient of services of supply of goods by a person in a nontaxable territory by a vessel to include an importer u/s. 2(26) of the Customs Act, 1962 – Respondents-importers of non coking coal on a Cost-Insurance-Freight (CIF) basis, filed writ petition challenging the notifications – High Court held that the impugned notifications are unconstitutional for exceeding the powers conferred by the IGST Act and the CGST Act – On appeal, held: Government in exercise of its power u/s.5(3) of the IGST Act issued the impugned Notification 10/2017 specifying the ‘categories of the supply’ which shall be subject to reverse charge – The notification, besides specifying the criteria also mentioned the corresponding recipient in those categories – The IGST Act and the CGST Act define reverse charge and prescribe the entity that is to be taxed for these purposes – The specification of the recipient- in this case the importer- by Notification 10/2017 is only clarificatory – The Government by notification did not specify a taxable entity different from that which is prescribed in s.5(3) of the IGST Act for the purposes of reverse charge – The impugned notification 10/2017 clearly specifies a taxable person who is liable to pay a reverse charge that is envisaged in the statute – Thus, the impugned notifications cannot be invalidated for an alleged failure to identify a taxable person – Further, the impugned notification 8/2017 cannot be struck down for excessive delegation when it prescribes 10 per cent of the CIF value as the mechanism for imposing tax on a reverse charge basis – Also, Constitution Bench decision in GVK Industries recognises the power of Parliament to legislate over events occurring extra-territorially – The only requirement imposed is that such an event must have a real connection to India – In the present case, the impugned levy on the supply of transportation service by the shipping line to the foreign exporter to import goods into India has a two-fold connection: first, the destination of the goods is India and thus, a clear territorial nexus is established with the event occurring outside the territory; and second, the services are rendered for the benefit of the Indian importer – Thus, the transaction does have a nexus with the territory of India – On a conjoint reading of ss.2(11) and 13(9) of the IGST Act, r/w ss.2(93) of the CGST Act, the import of goods by a CIF contract constitutes an “inter-state” supply which can be subject to IGST where the importer of such goods would be the recipient of shipping service – s.5(4) of the IGST Act enables the Central Government to specify a class of registered persons as the recipients, thereby conferring the power of creating a deeming fiction on the delegated legislation – Validity of the impugned notifications upheld u/ss.5(3) and 5(4) of the IGST Act – However, the impugned levy imposed on the ‘service’ aspect of the transaction is in violation of the principle of ‘composite supply’ enshrined u/s.2(30) r/w s.8, CGST Act and the overall scheme of the GST legislation – Double taxation – Customs Act 1962 – s.2(26). Integrated Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017 – Statutory provisions and Scheme of the Act – Discussed. Constitution of India – Constitution (One Hundred and First Amendment Act) 2016 – Legislative History – Discussed. Integrated Goods and Services Tax, Act 2017 – ss.2(11), 13(9) – Central Goods and Services Tax, Act 2017 – s.2(93) – Whether the import of goods by a CIF contract constitutes an “inter-state” supply which can be subject to IGST where the importer of such goods would be the recipient of shipping service – Held: Yes. Constitution of India – Power of Parliament to levy tax over events occurring extra-territorially – Discussed – Central Goods and Services Tax, Act 2017 – Integrated Goods and Services Tax, Act 2017. Central Goods and Services Tax, Act 2017 – s.2(93) – Integrated Goods and Services Tax, Act 2017 – ss.5(3), 5(4) – Plea of respondents that the amended and unamended s.5(4) do not save the impugned notifications since they still make the reference to the term “recipient” – Held: s.5(4) employs the language “as the recipient”, in contradistinction to s.5(3) of the IGST Act which uses “by the recipient” – Recipient includes the importer – Further, s.5(4) clarifies that it may designate a class of registered persons as the recipient, thereby broadening the scope of s.2(93) of the CGST Act which is anyway an inclusive definition since s.2 is prefaced with “unless the context otherwise requires” – It is settled law that nonreference of the source of power may not vitiate its exercise and application in given facts and circumstances of a case. Integrated Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017 – s.5(3), 13(9) – Central Goods and Services Tax, Act 2017– s.2(93)(c) – Whether the imports of goods on a CIF basis would also constitute import of shipping services, by way of deeming fiction – Held: s.5(3) of the IGST Act does not confer the powers on the Central Government to create a deeming fiction vis-à-vis who constitutes the recipient – It merely enables the Central Government to identify certain categories of goods and services, where the recipient of such services is subject to a reverse charge, as opposed to the usual mode of taxation where the supplier of the service is charged on a forward charge basis – However, s.13(9) of the IGST Act r/w s.2(93)(c) of the CGST Act inherently create a deeming fiction of the importer of goods to be the recipient of shipping service. Constitution of India – “Recommendations”– Articles 3, 109, 111, 113, 117, 203, 207, 255 and 274; Article 233; Articles 243I, 243Y, 280, 281, 338, 338B and 340; Article 263; Articles 270, 275, 344, 349 and 371A – Nature and contextual meaning of – Discussed. Constitution of India – Constitutional role and functions of the GST Council, in the context of the simultaneous legislative power conferred on Parliament and the State legislatures – Discussed. Constitution of India – Constitution (One Hundred and First Amendment Act) 2016 – Articles 246A, 279A – Held: GST Council is not only an avenue for the exercise of cooperative federalism but also for political contestation across party lines – Thus, the discussions in the GST Council impact both federalism and democracy – The constitutional design of the Constitution Amendment Act 2016 is sui generis since it introduces unique features of federalism – Article 246A treats the Centre and States as equal units by conferring a simultaneous power of enacting law on GST – Article 279A in constituting the GST Council envisions that neither the Centre nor the States can act independent of the other. Constitution of India – GST Law – Essential legislative functions – Excessive delegation of, if any – Constitution (One Hundred and First Amendment Act) 2016 – Central Goods and Services Tax, Act 2017 – Integrated Goods and Services Tax, Act 2017 – Whether the impugned notifications are ultra vires the IGST Act on the grounds of excessive delegation – Held: Legislature is required to perform its essential legislative functions – Once the skeletal structure of the policy is framed by the legislature, the details can emerge through delegated legislations – Legislature cannot delegate its ‘essential legislative functions – Essential legislative functions with respect to the GST law are the levy of tax, subject matter of tax, taxable person, rate of taxation and value for the purpose of taxation – Principles governing these essential aspects of taxation find place in the IGST Act – Both the IGST and CGST Act clearly define reverse charge, recipient and taxable persons – Thus, the essential legislative functions vis-à-vis reverse charge have not been delegated. Integrated Goods and Services Tax, Act 2017 – Central Goods and Services Tax, Act 2017 – ss. 2(30) and 8 – Impugned levy seeking to impose IGST on the ‘service’ aspect of the transaction, if in violation of the principle of ‘composite supply’ incorporated u/ s.2(30) r/w s.8 of the CGST Act – Held: Yes – Since the Indian importer is liable to pay IGST on the ‘composite supply’, comprising of supply of goods and supply of services of transportation, insurance, etc. in a CIF contract, a separate levy on the Indian importer for the ‘supply of services’ by the shipping line would be in violation of s.8 of the CGST Act – Double taxation. Central Goods and Services Tax, Act 2017 – s.2(93)(c) – Integrated Goods and Services Tax, Act 2017 – s.13(9) – Held: The only argument that supports the case of the appellant is that of s.13(9) of the IGST Act r/w s.2(93)(c) of the CGST Act which defines a “recipient” – s.13(9) of the IGST Act creates the deeming fiction of place of supply of service to be the destination of goods when they are transported by means other than mail or courier – No specific exemptions for importers have been carved out – This reasoning is accepted and read into the definition of recipient in s.2(93) of the CGST Act. Central Goods and Services Tax, Act 2017 – s.24(iii) – Integrated Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017 – ss.5(3), (4) – Held: Power of the Central Government to designate persons and categories of supply for reverse charge derives from ss.5(3) and 5(4) of the IGST Act and not s.24(iii) of the CGST Act which mandates the compulsorily registration as a logical corollary to ensure tax collection. Central Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017 – s.2(93) – Integrated Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017 – s.5(3) – Held: Interpreting the term “by the recipient” vis-à-vis the categories of goods and services identified in s.5(3) of the IGST Act should necessarily be governed by the principles governing the definition of “recipient” u/s.2(93) of the CGST Act. Interpretation of Statutes – Legislative history, Parliamentary debates, Committee Reports – Held: Though the traditional view of interpretation of statutes is that legislative history is not readily used in interpreting a law, the modern trend of thinking on the subject has enabled courts to look into the history of a legislation to understand the full purport of the words used and the mischief sought to be remedied by the law – Constitution of India – Articles 246A, 279A – Constitution (One Hundred and First Amendment Act) 2016 – Central Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017 – Integrated Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017. Words and Phrases: “Recommendations”– Constitution of India – Interpretation of, vis-à-vis the provisions of IGST Act and CGST Act – Integrated Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017 – Central Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017. ‘Cooperative federalism’; ‘Dual federalism’; ‘Fiscal federalism’ – Discussed",

Constitution of India – Constitution (One Hundred and First Amendment Act) 2016 – Articles 246 A and 279A – Central Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017 – ss.2(30), 2(93), 8 – Integrated Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017 – ss.2(11), 5(3), 13(9) – Impugned notifications (Notification 8/2017 and 10/2017) issued by Central Government on the advice of the GST Council levied an integrated tax at the rate of 5 per cent on the supply of specified services, including transportation of goods, in a vessel from a place outside India up to the customs station of clearance in India and categorized the recipient of services of supply of goods by a person in a nontaxable territory by a vessel to include an importer u/s. 2(26) of the Customs Act, 1962 – Respondents-importers of non coking coal on a Cost-Insurance-Freight (CIF) basis, filed writ petition challenging the notifications – High Court held that the impugned notifications are unconstitutional for exceeding the powers conferred by the IGST Act and the CGST Act – On appeal, held: Government in exercise of its power u/s.5(3) of the IGST Act issued the impugned Notification 10/2017 specifying the ‘categories of the supply’ which shall be subject to reverse charge – The notification, besides specifying the criteria also mentioned the corresponding recipient in those categories – The IGST Act and the CGST Act define reverse charge and prescribe the entity that is to be taxed for these purposes – The specification of the recipient- in this case the importer- by Notification 10/2017 is only clarificatory – The Government by notification did not specify a taxable entity different from that which is prescribed in s.5(3) of the IGST Act for the purposes of reverse charge – The impugned notification 10/2017 clearly specifies a taxable person who is liable to pay a reverse charge that is envisaged in the statute – Thus, the impugned notifications cannot be invalidated for an alleged failure to identify a taxable person – Further, the impugned notification 8/2017 cannot be struck down for excessive delegation when it prescribes 10 per cent of the CIF value as the mechanism for imposing tax on a reverse charge basis – Also, Constitution Bench decision in GVK Industries recognises the power of Parliament to legislate over events occurring extra-territorially – The only requirement imposed is that such an event must have a real connection to India – In the present case, the impugned levy on the supply of transportation service by the shipping line to the foreign exporter to import goods into India has a two-fold connection: first, the destination of the goods is India and thus, a clear territorial nexus is established with the event occurring outside the territory; and second, the services are rendered for the benefit of the Indian importer – Thus, the transaction does have a nexus with the territory of India – On a conjoint reading of ss.2(11) and 13(9) of the IGST Act, r/w ss.2(93) of the CGST Act, the import of goods by a CIF contract constitutes an “inter-state” supply which can be subject to IGST where the importer of such goods would be the recipient of shipping service – s.5(4) of the IGST Act enables the Central Government to specify a class of registered persons as the recipients, thereby conferring the power of creating a deeming fiction on the delegated legislation – Validity of the impugned notifications upheld u/ss.5(3) and 5(4) of the IGST Act – However, the impugned levy imposed on the ‘service’ aspect of the transaction is in violation of the principle of ‘composite supply’ enshrined u/s.2(30) r/w s.8, CGST Act and the overall scheme of the GST legislation – Double taxation – Customs Act 1962 – s.2(26). Integrated Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017 – Statutory provisions and Scheme of the Act – Discussed. Constitution of India – Constitution (One Hundred and First Amendment Act) 2016 – Legislative History – Discussed. Integrated Goods and Services Tax, Act 2017 – ss.2(11), 13(9) – Central Goods and Services Tax, Act 2017 – s.2(93) – Whether the import of goods by a CIF contract constitutes an “inter-state” supply which can be subject to IGST where the importer of such goods would be the recipient of shipping service – Held: Yes. Constitution of India – Power of Parliament to levy tax over events occurring extra-territorially – Discussed – Central Goods and Services Tax, Act 2017 – Integrated Goods and Services Tax, Act 2017. Central Goods and Services Tax, Act 2017 – s.2(93) – Integrated Goods and Services Tax, Act 2017 – ss.5(3), 5(4) – Plea of respondents that the amended and unamended s.5(4) do not save the impugned notifications since they still make the reference to the term “recipient” – Held: s.5(4) employs the language “as the recipient”, in contradistinction to s.5(3) of the IGST Act which uses “by the recipient” – Recipient includes the importer – Further, s.5(4) clarifies that it may designate a class of registered persons as the recipient, thereby broadening the scope of s.2(93) of the CGST Act which is anyway an inclusive definition since s.2 is prefaced with “unless the context otherwise requires” – It is settled law that nonreference of the source of power may not vitiate its exercise and application in given facts and circumstances of a case. Integrated Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017 – s.5(3), 13(9) – Central Goods and Services Tax, Act 2017– s.2(93)(c) – Whether the imports of goods on a CIF basis would also constitute import of shipping services, by way of deeming fiction – Held: s.5(3) of the IGST Act does not confer the powers on the Central Government to create a deeming fiction vis-à-vis who constitutes the recipient – It merely enables the Central Government to identify certain categories of goods and services, where the recipient of such services is subject to a reverse charge, as opposed to the usual mode of taxation where the supplier of the service is charged on a forward charge basis – However, s.13(9) of the IGST Act r/w s.2(93)(c) of the CGST Act inherently create a deeming fiction of the importer of goods to be the recipient of shipping service. Constitution of India – “Recommendations”– Articles 3, 109, 111, 113, 117, 203, 207, 255 and 274; Article 233; Articles 243I, 243Y, 280, 281, 338, 338B and 340; Article 263; Articles 270, 275, 344, 349 and 371A – Nature and contextual meaning of – Discussed. Constitution of India – Constitutional role and functions of the GST Council, in the context of the simultaneous legislative power conferred on Parliament and the State legislatures – Discussed. Constitution of India – Constitution (One Hundred and First Amendment Act) 2016 – Articles 246A, 279A – Held: GST Council is not only an avenue for the exercise of cooperative federalism but also for political contestation across party lines – Thus, the discussions in the GST Council impact both federalism and democracy – The constitutional design of the Constitution Amendment Act 2016 is sui generis since it introduces unique features of federalism – Article 246A treats the Centre and States as equal units by conferring a simultaneous power of enacting law on GST – Article 279A in constituting the GST Council envisions that neither the Centre nor the States can act independent of the other. Constitution of India – GST Law – Essential legislative functions – Excessive delegation of, if any – Constitution (One Hundred and First Amendment Act) 2016 – Central Goods and Services Tax, Act 2017 – Integrated Goods and Services Tax, Act 2017 – Whether the impugned notifications are ultra vires the IGST Act on the grounds of excessive delegation – Held: Legislature is required to perform its essential legislative functions – Once the skeletal structure of the policy is framed by the legislature, the details can emerge through delegated legislations – Legislature cannot delegate its ‘essential legislative functions – Essential legislative functions with respect to the GST law are the levy of tax, subject matter of tax, taxable person, rate of taxation and value for the purpose of taxation – Principles governing these essential aspects of taxation find place in the IGST Act – Both the IGST and CGST Act clearly define reverse charge, recipient and taxable persons – Thus, the essential legislative functions vis-à-vis reverse charge have not been delegated. Integrated Goods and Services Tax, Act 2017 – Central Goods and Services Tax, Act 2017 – ss. 2(30) and 8 – Impugned levy seeking to impose IGST on the ‘service’ aspect of the transaction, if in violation of the principle of ‘composite supply’ incorporated u/ s.2(30) r/w s.8 of the CGST Act – Held: Yes – Since the Indian importer is liable to pay IGST on the ‘composite supply’, comprising of supply of goods and supply of services of transportation, insurance, etc. in a CIF contract, a separate levy on the Indian importer for the ‘supply of services’ by the shipping line would be in violation of s.8 of the CGST Act – Double taxation. Central Goods and Services Tax, Act 2017 – s.2(93)(c) – Integrated Goods and Services Tax, Act 2017 – s.13(9) – Held: The only argument that supports the case of the appellant is that of s.13(9) of the IGST Act r/w s.2(93)(c) of the CGST Act which defines a “recipient” – s.13(9) of the IGST Act creates the deeming fiction of place of supply of service to be the destination of goods when they are transported by means other than mail or courier – No specific exemptions for importers have been carved out – This reasoning is accepted and read into the definition of recipient in s.2(93) of the CGST Act. Central Goods and Services Tax, Act 2017 – s.24(iii) – Integrated Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017 – ss.5(3), (4) – Held: Power of the Central Government to designate persons and categories of supply for reverse charge derives from ss.5(3) and 5(4) of the IGST Act and not s.24(iii) of the CGST Act which mandates the compulsorily registration as a logical corollary to ensure tax collection. Central Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017 – s.2(93) – Integrated Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017 – s.5(3) – Held: Interpreting the term “by the recipient” vis-à-vis the categories of goods and services identified in s.5(3) of the IGST Act should necessarily be governed by the principles governing the definition of “recipient” u/s.2(93) of the CGST Act. Interpretation of Statutes – Legislative history, Parliamentary debates, Committee Reports – Held: Though the traditional view of interpretation of statutes is that legislative history is not readily used in interpreting a law, the modern trend of thinking on the subject has enabled courts to look into the history of a legislation to understand the full purport of the words used and the mischief sought to be remedied by the law – Constitution of India – Articles 246A, 279A – Constitution (One Hundred and First Amendment Act) 2016 – Central Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017 – Integrated Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017. Words and Phrases: “Recommendations”– Constitution of India – Interpretation of, vis-à-vis the provisions of IGST Act and CGST Act – Integrated Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017 – Central Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017. ‘Cooperative federalism’; ‘Dual federalism’; ‘Fiscal federalism’ – Discussed",

        "content": "279(1) by the Constitution Amendment Act 2016 indicates that the Parliament intended for the recommendations of the GST Council to only have a persuasive value, particularly when interpreted along with the objective of the GST regime to foster cooperative federalism and harmony between the constituent units – Neither does Art. 279A begin with a non-obstante clause nor does Article 246A state that it is subject to the provisions of Article 279A – Parliament and the State legislatures possess simultaneous power to legislate on GST – Art. 246A does not envisage a repugnancy provision to resolve the inconsistencies between the Central and the State laws on GST – The ‘recommendations’ of the GST Council are the product of a collaborative dialogue involving the Union and States – They are recommendatory in nature – To regard them as binding edicts would disrupt fiscal federalism, where both the Union and the States are conferred equal power to legislate on GST – Government while exercising its rule-making power under the provisions of the CGST Act and IGST Act is bound by the recommendations of the GST Council – However, that does not mean that all the recommendations of the GST Council made by virtue of the power Art. 279A (4) are binding on the legislature’s power to enact primary legislations."

Constitution of India – Constitution (One Hundred and First Amendment Act) 2016 – Articles 246 A and 279A – Central Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017 – ss.2(30), 2(93), 8 – Integrated Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017 – ss.2(11), 5(3), 13(9) – Impugned notifications (Notification 8/2017 and 10/2017) issued by Central Government on the advice of the GST Council levied an integrated tax at the rate of 5 per cent on the supply of specified services, including transportation of goods, in a vessel from a place outside India up to the customs station of clearance in India and categorized the recipient of services of supply of goods by a person in a nontaxable territory by a vessel to include an importer u/s. 2(26) of the Customs Act, 1962 – Respondents-importers of non coking coal on a Cost-Insurance-Freight (CIF) basis, filed writ petition challenging the notifications – High Court held that the impugned notifications are unconstitutional for exceeding the powers conferred by the IGST Act and the CGST Act – On appeal, held: Government in exercise of its power u/s.5(3) of the IGST Act issued the impugned Notification 10/2017 specifying the ‘categories of the supply’ which shall be subject to reverse charge – The notification, besides specifying the criteria also mentioned the corresponding recipient in those categories – The IGST Act and the CGST Act define reverse charge and prescribe the entity that is to be taxed for these purposes – The specification of the recipient- in this case the importer- by Notification 10/2017 is only clarificatory – The Government by notification did not specify a taxable entity different from that which is prescribed in s.5(3) of the IGST Act for the purposes of reverse charge – The impugned notification 10/2017 clearly specifies a taxable person who is liable to pay a reverse charge that is envisaged in the statute – Thus, the impugned notifications cannot be invalidated for an alleged failure to identify a taxable person – Further, the impugned notification 8/2017 cannot be struck down for excessive delegation when it prescribes 10 per cent of the CIF value as the mechanism for imposing tax on a reverse charge basis – Also, Constitution Bench decision in GVK Industries recognises the power of Parliament to legislate over events occurring extra-territorially – The only requirement imposed is that such an event must have a real connection to India – In the present case, the impugned levy on the supply of transportation service by the shipping line to the foreign exporter to import goods into India has a two-fold connection: first, the destination of the goods is India and thus, a clear territorial nexus is established with the event occurring outside the territory; and second, the services are rendered for the benefit of the Indian importer – Thus, the transaction does have a nexus with the territory of India – On a conjoint reading of ss.2(11) and 13(9) of the IGST Act, r/w ss.2(93) of the CGST Act, the import of goods by a CIF contract constitutes an “inter-state” supply which can be subject to IGST where the importer of such goods would be the recipient of shipping service – s.5(4) of the IGST Act enables the Central Government to specify a class of registered persons as the recipients, thereby conferring the power of creating a deeming fiction on the delegated legislation – Validity of the impugned notifications upheld u/ss.5(3) and 5(4) of the IGST Act – However, the impugned levy imposed on the ‘service’ aspect of the transaction is in violation of the principle of ‘composite supply’ enshrined u/s.2(30) r/w s.8, CGST Act and the overall scheme of the GST legislation – Double taxation – Customs Act 1962 – s.2(26). Integrated Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017 – Statutory provisions and Scheme of the Act – Discussed. Constitution of India – Constitution (One Hundred and First Amendment Act) 2016 – Legislative History – Discussed. Integrated Goods and Services Tax, Act 2017 – ss.2(11), 13(9) – Central Goods and Services Tax, Act 2017 – s.2(93) – Whether the import of goods by a CIF contract constitutes an “inter-state” supply which can be subject to IGST where the importer of such goods would be the recipient of shipping service – Held: Yes. Constitution of India – Power of Parliament to levy tax over events occurring extra-territorially – Discussed – Central Goods and Services Tax, Act 2017 – Integrated Goods and Services Tax, Act 2017. Central Goods and Services Tax, Act 2017 – s.2(93) – Integrated Goods and Services Tax, Act 2017 – ss.5(3), 5(4) – Plea of respondents that the amended and unamended s.5(4) do not save the impugned notifications since they still make the reference to the term “recipient” – Held: s.5(4) employs the language “as the recipient”, in contradistinction to s.5(3) of the IGST Act which uses “by the recipient” – Recipient includes the importer – Further, s.5(4) clarifies that it may designate a class of registered persons as the recipient, thereby broadening the scope of s.2(93) of the CGST Act which is anyway an inclusive definition since s.2 is prefaced with “unless the context otherwise requires” – It is settled law that nonreference of the source of power may not vitiate its exercise and application in given facts and circumstances of a case. Integrated Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017 – s.5(3), 13(9) – Central Goods and Services Tax, Act 2017– s.2(93)(c) – Whether the imports of goods on a CIF basis would also constitute import of shipping services, by way of deeming fiction – Held: s.5(3) of the IGST Act does not confer the powers on the Central Government to create a deeming fiction vis-à-vis who constitutes the recipient – It merely enables the Central Government to identify certain categories of goods and services, where the recipient of such services is subject to a reverse charge, as opposed to the usual mode of taxation where the supplier of the service is charged on a forward charge basis – However, s.13(9) of the IGST Act r/w s.2(93)(c) of the CGST Act inherently create a deeming fiction of the importer of goods to be the recipient of shipping service. Constitution of India – “Recommendations”– Articles 3, 109, 111, 113, 117, 203, 207, 255 and 274; Article 233; Articles 243I, 243Y, 280, 281, 338, 338B and 340; Article 263; Articles 270, 275, 344, 349 and 371A – Nature and contextual meaning of – Discussed. Constitution of India – Constitutional role and functions of the GST Council, in the context of the simultaneous legislative power conferred on Parliament and the State legislatures – Discussed. Constitution of India – Constitution (One Hundred and First Amendment Act) 2016 – Articles 246A, 279A – Held: GST Council is not only an avenue for the exercise of cooperative federalism but also for political contestation across party lines – Thus, the discussions in the GST Council impact both federalism and democracy – The constitutional design of the Constitution Amendment Act 2016 is sui generis since it introduces unique features of federalism – Article 246A treats the Centre and States as equal units by conferring a simultaneous power of enacting law on GST – Article 279A in constituting the GST Council envisions that neither the Centre nor the States can act independent of the other. Constitution of India – GST Law – Essential legislative functions – Excessive delegation of, if any – Constitution (One Hundred and First Amendment Act) 2016 – Central Goods and Services Tax, Act 2017 – Integrated Goods and Services Tax, Act 2017 – Whether the impugned notifications are ultra vires the IGST Act on the grounds of excessive delegation – Held: Legislature is required to perform its essential legislative functions – Once the skeletal structure of the policy is framed by the legislature, the details can emerge through delegated legislations – Legislature cannot delegate its ‘essential legislative functions – Essential legislative functions with respect to the GST law are the levy of tax, subject matter of tax, taxable person, rate of taxation and value for the purpose of taxation – Principles governing these essential aspects of taxation find place in the IGST Act – Both the IGST and CGST Act clearly define reverse charge, recipient and taxable persons – Thus, the essential legislative functions vis-à-vis reverse charge have not been delegated. Integrated Goods and Services Tax, Act 2017 – Central Goods and Services Tax, Act 2017 – ss. 2(30) and 8 – Impugned levy seeking to impose IGST on the ‘service’ aspect of the transaction, if in violation of the principle of ‘composite supply’ incorporated u/ s.2(30) r/w s.8 of the CGST Act – Held: Yes – Since the Indian importer is liable to pay IGST on the ‘composite supply’, comprising of supply of goods and supply of services of transportation, insurance, etc. in a CIF contract, a separate levy on the Indian importer for the ‘supply of services’ by the shipping line would be in violation of s.8 of the CGST Act – Double taxation. Central Goods and Services Tax, Act 2017 – s.2(93)(c) – Integrated Goods and Services Tax, Act 2017 – s.13(9) – Held: The only argument that supports the case of the appellant is that of s.13(9) of the IGST Act r/w s.2(93)(c) of the CGST Act which defines a “recipient” – s.13(9) of the IGST Act creates the deeming fiction of place of supply of service to be the destination of goods when they are transported by means other than mail or courier – No specific exemptions for importers have been carved out – This reasoning is accepted and read into the definition of recipient in s.2(93) of the CGST Act. Central Goods and Services Tax, Act 2017 – s.24(iii) – Integrated Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017 – ss.5(3), (4) – Held: Power of the Central Government to designate persons and categories of supply for reverse charge derives from ss.5(3) and 5(4) of the IGST Act and not s.24(iii) of the CGST Act which mandates the compulsorily registration as a logical corollary to ensure tax collection. Central Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017 – s.2(93) – Integrated Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017 – s.5(3) – Held: Interpreting the term “by the recipient” vis-à-vis the categories of goods and services identified in s.5(3) of the IGST Act should necessarily be governed by the principles governing the definition of “recipient” u/s.2(93) of the CGST Act. Interpretation of Statutes – Legislative history, Parliamentary debates, Committee Reports – Held: Though the traditional view of interpretation of statutes is that legislative history is not readily used in interpreting a law, the modern trend of thinking on the subject has enabled courts to look into the history of a legislation to understand the full purport of the words used and the mischief sought to be remedied by the law – Constitution of India – Articles 246A, 279A – Constitution (One Hundred and First Amendment Act) 2016 – Central Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017 – Integrated Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017. Words and Phrases: “Recommendations”– Constitution of India – Interpretation of, vis-à-vis the provisions of IGST Act and CGST Act – Integrated Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017 – Central Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017. ‘Cooperative federalism’; ‘Dual federalism’; ‘Fiscal federalism’ – Discussed",

        "content": "Constitution of India – Constitution (One Hundred and First Amendment Act) 2016 – Articles 246 A and 279A – Central Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017 – ss.2(30), 2(93), 8 – Integrated Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017 – ss.2(11), 5(3), 13(9) – Impugned notifications (Notification 8/2017 and 10/2017) issued by Central Government on the advice of the GST Council levied an integrated tax at the rate of 5 per cent on the supply of specified services, including transportation of goods, in a vessel from a place outside India up to the customs station of clearance in India and categorized the recipient of services of supply of goods by a person in a nontaxable territory by a vessel to include an importer u/s. 2(26) of the Customs Act, 1962 – Respondents-importers of non coking coal on a Cost-Insurance-Freight (CIF) basis, filed writ petition challenging the notifications – High Court held that the impugned notifications are unconstitutional for exceeding the powers conferred by the IGST Act and the CGST Act – On appeal, held: Government in exercise of its power u/s.5(3) of the IGST Act issued the impugned Notification 10/2017 specifying the ‘categories of the supply’ which shall be subject to reverse charge – The notification, besides specifying the criteria also mentioned the corresponding recipient in those categories – The IGST Act and the CGST Act define reverse charge and prescribe the entity that is to be taxed for these purposes – The specification of the recipient- in this case the importer- by Notification 10/2017 is only clarificatory – The Government by notification did not specify a taxable entity different from that which is prescribed in s.5(3) of the IGST Act for the purposes of reverse charge – The impugned notification 10/2017 clearly specifies a taxable person who is liable to pay a reverse charge that is envisaged in the statute – Thus, the impugned notifications cannot be invalidated for an alleged failure to identify a taxable person – Further, the impugned notification 8/2017 cannot be struck down for excessive delegation when it prescribes 10 per cent of the CIF value as the mechanism for imposing tax on a reverse charge basis – Also, Constitution Bench decision in GVK Industries recognises the power of Parliament to legislate over events occurring extra-territorially – The only requirement imposed is that such an event must have a real connection to India – In the present case, the impugned levy on the supply of transportation service by the shipping line to the foreign exporter to import goods into India has a two-fold connection: first, the destination of the goods is India and thus, a clear territorial nexus is established with the event occurring outside the territory; and second, the services are rendered for the benefit of the Indian importer – Thus, the transaction does have a nexus with the territory of India – On a conjoint reading of ss.2(11) and 13(9) of the IGST Act, r/w ss.2(93) of the CGST Act, the import of goods by a CIF contract constitutes an “inter-state” supply which can be subject to IGST where the importer of such goods would be the recipient of shipping service – s.5(4) of the IGST Act enables the Central Government to specify a class of registered persons as the recipients, thereby conferring the power of creating a deeming fiction on the delegated legislation – Validity of the impugned notifications upheld u/ss.5(3) and 5(4) of the IGST Act – However, the impugned levy imposed on the ‘service’ aspect of the transaction is in violation of the principle of ‘composite supply’ enshrined u/s.2(30) r/w s.8, CGST Act and the overall scheme of the GST legislation – Double taxation – Customs Act 1962 – s.2(26). Integrated Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017 – Statutory provisions and Scheme of the Act – Discussed."

        "HeadNote": "Constitution of India – Articles 246A and 279A – Constitution (One Hundred and First Amendment Act) 2016 – Central Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017 – Integrated Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017 – Recommendations of Goods and Services Tax Council – Nature of – Held: Recommendations of the GST Council are not binding on the Union and States – Deletion of Art. 279B and the inclusion of Art. 279(1) by the Constitution Amendment Act 2016 indicates that the Parliament intended for the recommendations of the GST Council to only have a persuasive value, particularly when interpreted along with the objective of the GST regime to foster cooperative federalism and harmony between the constituent units – Neither does Art. 279A begin with a non-obstante clause nor does Article 246A state that it is subject to the provisions of Article 279A – Parliament and the State legislatures possess simultaneous power to legislate on GST – Art. 246A does not envisage a repugnancy provision to resolve the inconsistencies between the Central and the State laws on GST – The ‘recommendations’ of the GST Council are the product of a collaborative dialogue involving the Union and States – They are recommendatory in nature – To regard them as binding edicts would disrupt fiscal federalism, where both the Union and the States are conferred equal power to legislate on GST – Government while exercising its rule-making power under the provisions of the CGST Act and IGST Act is bound by the recommendations of the GST Council – However, that does not mean that all the recommendations of the GST Council made by virtue of the power Art. 279A (4) are binding on the legislature’s power to enact primary legislations. Constitution of India – Constitution (One Hundred and First Amendment Act) 2016 – Articles 246 A and 279A – Central Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017 – ss.2(30), 2(93), 8 – Integrated Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017 – ss.2(11), 5(3), 13(9) – Impugned notifications (Notification 8/2017 and 10/2017) issued by Central Government on the advice of the GST Council levied an integrated tax at the rate of 5 per cent on the supply of specified services, including transportation of goods, in a vessel from a place outside India up to the customs station of clearance in India and categorized the recipient of services of supply of goods by a person in a nontaxable territory by a vessel to include an importer u/s. 2(26) of the Customs Act, 1962 – Respondents-importers of non coking coal on a Cost-Insurance-Freight (CIF) basis, filed writ petition challenging the notifications – High Court held that the impugned notifications are unconstitutional for exceeding the powers conferred by the IGST Act and the CGST Act – On appeal, held: Government in exercise of its power u/s.5(3) of the IGST Act issued the impugned Notification 10/2017 specifying the ‘categories of the supply’ which shall be subject to reverse charge – The notification, besides specifying the criteria also mentioned the corresponding recipient in those categories – The IGST Act and the CGST Act define reverse charge and prescribe the entity that is to be taxed for these purposes – The specification of the recipient- in this case the importer- by Notification 10/2017 is only clarificatory – The Government by notification did not specify a taxable entity different from that which is prescribed in s.5(3) of the IGST Act for the purposes of reverse charge – The impugned notification 10/2017 clearly specifies a taxable person who is liable to pay a reverse charge that is envisaged in the statute – Thus, the impugned notifications cannot be invalidated for an alleged failure to identify a taxable person – Further, the impugned notification 8/2017 cannot be struck down for excessive delegation when it prescribes 10 per cent of the CIF value as the mechanism for imposing tax on a reverse charge basis – Also, Constitution Bench decision in GVK Industries recognises the power of Parliament to legislate over events occurring extra-territorially – The only requirement imposed is that such an event must have a real connection to India – In the present case, the impugned levy on the supply of transportation service by the shipping line to the foreign exporter to import goods into India has a two-fold connection: first, the destination of the goods is India and thus, a clear territorial nexus is established with the event occurring outside the territory; and second, the services are rendered for the benefit of the Indian importer – Thus, the transaction does have a nexus with the territory of India – On a conjoint reading of ss.2(11) and 13(9) of the IGST Act, r/w ss.2(93) of the CGST Act, the import of goods by a CIF contract constitutes an “inter-state” supply which can be subject to IGST where the importer of such goods would be the recipient of shipping service – s.5(4) of the IGST Act enables the Central Government to specify a class of registered persons as the recipients, thereby conferring the power of creating a deeming fiction on the delegated legislation – Validity of the impugned notifications upheld u/ss.5(3) and 5(4) of the IGST Act – However, the impugned levy imposed on the ‘service’ aspect of the transaction is in violation of the principle of ‘composite supply’ enshrined u/s.2(30) r/w s.8, CGST Act and the overall scheme of the GST legislation – Double taxation – Customs Act 1962 – s.2(26). Integrated Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017 – Statutory provisions and Scheme of the Act – Discussed. Constitution of India – Constitution (One Hundred and First Amendment Act) 2016 – Legislative History – Discussed. Integrated Goods and Services Tax, Act 2017 – ss.2(11), 13(9) – Central Goods and Services Tax, Act 2017 – s.2(93) – Whether the import of goods by a CIF contract constitutes an “inter-state” supply which can be subject to IGST where the importer of such goods would be the recipient of shipping service – Held: Yes. Constitution of India – Power of Parliament to levy tax over events occurring extra-territorially – Discussed – Central Goods and Services Tax, Act 2017 – Integrated Goods and Services Tax, Act 2017. Central Goods and Services Tax, Act 2017 – s.2(93) – Integrated Goods and Services Tax, Act 2017 – ss.5(3), 5(4) – Plea of respondents that the amended and unamended s.5(4) do not save the impugned notifications since they still make the reference to the term “recipient” – Held: s.5(4) employs the language “as the recipient”, in contradistinction to s.5(3) of the IGST Act which uses “by the recipient” – Recipient includes the importer – Further, s.5(4) clarifies that it may designate a class of registered persons as the recipient, thereby broadening the scope of s.2(93) of the CGST Act which is anyway an inclusive definition since s.2 is prefaced with “unless the context otherwise requires” – It is settled law that nonreference of the source of power may not vitiate its exercise and application in given facts and circumstances of a case. Integrated Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017 – s.5(3), 13(9) – Central Goods and Services Tax, Act 2017– s.2(93)(c) – Whether the imports of goods on a CIF basis would also constitute import of shipping services, by way of deeming fiction – Held: s.5(3) of the IGST Act does not confer the powers on the Central Government to create a deeming fiction vis-à-vis who constitutes the recipient – It merely enables the Central Government to identify certain categories of goods and services, where the recipient of such services is subject to a reverse charge, as opposed to the usual mode of taxation where the supplier of the service is charged on a forward charge basis – However, s.13(9) of the IGST Act r/w s.2(93)(c) of the CGST Act inherently create a deeming fiction of the importer of goods to be the recipient of shipping service. Constitution of India – “Recommendations”– Articles 3, 109, 111, 113, 117, 203, 207, 255 and 274; Article 233; Articles 243I, 243Y, 280, 281, 338, 338B and 340; Article 263; Articles 270, 275, 344, 349 and 371A – Nature and contextual meaning of – Discussed. Constitution of India – Constitutional role and functions of the GST Council, in the context of the simultaneous legislative power conferred on Parliament and the State legislatures – Discussed. Constitution of India – Constitution (One Hundred and First Amendment Act) 2016 – Articles 246A, 279A – Held: GST Council is not only an avenue for the exercise of cooperative federalism but also for political contestation across party lines – Thus, the discussions in the GST Council impact both federalism and democracy – The constitutional design of the Constitution Amendment Act 2016 is sui generis since it introduces unique features of federalism – Article 246A treats the Centre and States as equal units by conferring a simultaneous power of enacting law on GST – Article 279A in constituting the GST Council envisions that neither the Centre nor the States can act independent of the other. Constitution of India – GST Law – Essential legislative functions – Excessive delegation of, if any – Constitution (One Hundred and First Amendment Act) 2016 – Central Goods and Services Tax, Act 2017 – Integrated Goods and Services Tax, Act 2017 – Whether the impugned notifications are ultra vires the IGST Act on the grounds of excessive delegation – Held: Legislature is required to perform its essential legislative functions – Once the skeletal structure of the policy is framed by the legislature, the details can emerge through delegated legislations – Legislature cannot delegate its ‘essential legislative functions – Essential legislative functions with respect to the GST law are the levy of tax, subject matter of tax, taxable person, rate of taxation and value for the purpose of taxation – Principles governing these essential aspects of taxation find place in the IGST Act – Both the IGST and CGST Act clearly define reverse charge, recipient and taxable persons – Thus, the essential legislative functions vis-à-vis reverse charge have not been delegated. Integrated Goods and Services Tax, Act 2017 – Central Goods and Services Tax, Act 2017 – ss. 2(30) and 8 – Impugned levy seeking to impose IGST on the ‘service’ aspect of the transaction, if in violation of the principle of ‘composite supply’ incorporated u/ s.2(30) r/w s.8 of the CGST Act – Held: Yes – Since the Indian importer is liable to pay IGST on the ‘composite supply’, comprising of supply of goods and supply of services of transportation, insurance, etc. in a CIF contract, a separate levy on the Indian importer for the ‘supply of services’ by the shipping line would be in violation of s.8 of the CGST Act – Double taxation. Central Goods and Services Tax, Act 2017 – s.2(93)(c) – Integrated Goods and Services Tax, Act 2017 – s.13(9) – Held: The only argument that supports the case of the appellant is that of s.13(9) of the IGST Act r/w s.2(93)(c) of the CGST Act which defines a “recipient” – s.13(9) of the IGST Act creates the deeming fiction of place of supply of service to be the destination of goods when they are transported by means other than mail or courier – No specific exemptions for importers have been carved out – This reasoning is accepted and read into the definition of recipient in s.2(93) of the CGST Act. Central Goods and Services Tax, Act 2017 – s.24(iii) – Integrated Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017 – ss.5(3), (4) – Held: Power of the Central Government to designate persons and categories of supply for reverse charge derives from ss.5(3) and 5(4) of the IGST Act and not s.24(iii) of the CGST Act which mandates the compulsorily registration as a logical corollary to ensure tax collection. Central Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017 – s.2(93) – Integrated Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017 – s.5(3) – Held: Interpreting the term “by the recipient” vis-à-vis the categories of goods and services identified in s.5(3) of the IGST Act should necessarily be governed by the principles governing the definition of “recipient” u/s.2(93) of the CGST Act. Interpretation of Statutes – Legislative history, Parliamentary debates, Committee Reports – Held: Though the traditional view of interpretation of statutes is that legislative history is not readily used in interpreting a law, the modern trend of thinking on the subject has enabled courts to look into the history of a legislation to understand the full purport of the words used and the mischief sought to be remedied by the law – Constitution of India – Articles 246A, 279A – Constitution (One Hundred and First Amendment Act) 2016 – Central Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017 – Integrated Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017. Words and Phrases: “Recommendations”– Constitution of India – Interpretation of, vis-à-vis the provisions of IGST Act and CGST Act – Integrated Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017 – Central Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017. ‘Cooperative federalism’; ‘Dual federalism’; ‘Fiscal federalism’ – Discussed",

Constitution of India – Constitution (One Hundred and First Amendment Act) 2016 – Articles 246 A and 279A – Central Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017 – ss.2(30), 2(93), 8 – Integrated Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017 – ss.2(11), 5(3), 13(9) – Impugned notifications (Notification 8/2017 and 10/2017) issued by Central Government on the advice of the GST Council levied an integrated tax at the rate of 5 per cent on the supply of specified services, including transportation of goods, in a vessel from a place outside India up to the customs station of clearance in India and categorized the recipient of services of supply of goods by a person in a nontaxable territory by a vessel to include an importer u/s. 2(26) of the Customs Act, 1962 – Respondents-importers of non coking coal on a Cost-Insurance-Freight (CIF) basis, filed writ petition challenging the notifications – High Court held that the impugned notifications are unconstitutional for exceeding the powers conferred by the IGST Act and the CGST Act – On appeal, held: Government in exercise of its power u/s.5(3) of the IGST Act issued the impugned Notification 10/2017 specifying the ‘categories of the supply’ which shall be subject to reverse charge – The notification, besides specifying the criteria also mentioned the corresponding recipient in those categories – The IGST Act and the CGST Act define reverse charge and prescribe the entity that is to be taxed for these purposes – The specification of the recipient- in this case the importer- by Notification 10/2017 is only clarificatory – The Government by notification did not specify a taxable entity different from that which is prescribed in s.5(3) of the IGST Act for the purposes of reverse charge – The impugned notification 10/2017 clearly specifies a taxable person who is liable to pay a reverse charge that is envisaged in the statute – Thus, the impugned notifications cannot be invalidated for an alleged failure to identify a taxable person – Further, the impugned notification 8/2017 cannot be struck down for excessive delegation when it prescribes 10 per cent of the CIF value as the mechanism for imposing tax on a reverse charge basis – Also, Constitution Bench decision in GVK Industries recognises the power of Parliament to legislate over events occurring extra-territorially – The only requirement imposed is that such an event must have a real connection to India – In the present case, the impugned levy on the supply of transportation service by the shipping line to the foreign exporter to import goods into India has a two-fold connection: first, the destination of the goods is India and thus, a clear territorial nexus is established with the event occurring outside the territory; and second, the services are rendered for the benefit of the Indian importer – Thus, the transaction does have a nexus with the territory of India – On a conjoint reading of ss.2(11) and 13(9) of the IGST Act, r/w ss.2(93) of the CGST Act, the import of goods by a CIF contract constitutes an “inter-state” supply which can be subject to IGST where the importer of such goods would be the recipient of shipping service – s.5(4) of the IGST Act enables the Central Government to specify a class of registered persons as the recipients, thereby conferring the power of creating a deeming fiction on the delegated legislation – Validity of the impugned notifications upheld u/ss.5(3) and 5(4) of the IGST Act – However, the impugned levy imposed on the ‘service’ aspect of the transaction is in violation of the principle of ‘composite supply’ enshrined u/s.2(30) r/w s.8, CGST Act and the overall scheme of the GST legislation – Double taxation – Customs Act 1962 – s.2(26). Integrated Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017 – Statutory provisions and Scheme of the Act – Discussed. Constitution of India – Constitution (One Hundred and First Amendment Act) 2016 – Legislative History – Discussed. Integrated Goods and Services Tax, Act 2017 – ss.2(11), 13(9) – Central Goods and Services Tax, Act 2017 – s.2(93) – Whether the import of goods by a CIF contract constitutes an “inter-state” supply which can be subject to IGST where the importer of such goods would be the recipient of shipping service – Held: Yes. Constitution of India – Power of Parliament to levy tax over events occurring extra-territorially – Discussed – Central Goods and Services Tax, Act 2017 – Integrated Goods and Services Tax, Act 2017. Central Goods and Services Tax, Act 2017 – s.2(93) – Integrated Goods and Services Tax, Act 2017 – ss.5(3), 5(4) – Plea of respondents that the amended and unamended s.5(4) do not save the impugned notifications since they still make the reference to the term “recipient” – Held: s.5(4) employs the language “as the recipient”, in contradistinction to s.5(3) of the IGST Act which uses “by the recipient” – Recipient includes the importer – Further, s.5(4) clarifies that it may designate a class of registered persons as the recipient, thereby broadening the scope of s.2(93) of the CGST Act which is anyway an inclusive definition since s.2 is prefaced with “unless the context otherwise requires” – It is settled law that nonreference of the source of power may not vitiate its exercise and application in given facts and circumstances of a case. Integrated Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017 – s.5(3), 13(9) – Central Goods and Services Tax, Act 2017– s.2(93)(c) – Whether the imports of goods on a CIF basis would also constitute import of shipping services, by way of deeming fiction – Held: s.5(3) of the IGST Act does not confer the powers on the Central Government to create a deeming fiction vis-à-vis who constitutes the recipient – It merely enables the Central Government to identify certain categories of goods and services, where the recipient of such services is subject to a reverse charge, as opposed to the usual mode of taxation where the supplier of the service is charged on a forward charge basis – However, s.13(9) of the IGST Act r/w s.2(93)(c) of the CGST Act inherently create a deeming fiction of the importer of goods to be the recipient of shipping service. Constitution of India – “Recommendations”– Articles 3, 109, 111, 113, 117, 203, 207, 255 and 274; Article 233; Articles 243I, 243Y, 280, 281, 338, 338B and 340; Article 263; Articles 270, 275, 344, 349 and 371A – Nature and contextual meaning of – Discussed. Constitution of India – Constitutional role and functions of the GST Council, in the context of the simultaneous legislative power conferred on Parliament and the State legislatures – Discussed. Constitution of India – Constitution (One Hundred and First Amendment Act) 2016 – Articles 246A, 279A – Held: GST Council is not only an avenue for the exercise of cooperative federalism but also for political contestation across party lines – Thus, the discussions in the GST Council impact both federalism and democracy – The constitutional design of the Constitution Amendment Act 2016 is sui generis since it introduces unique features of federalism – Article 246A treats the Centre and States as equal units by conferring a simultaneous power of enacting law on GST – Article 279A in constituting the GST Council envisions that neither the Centre nor the States can act independent of the other. Constitution of India – GST Law – Essential legislative functions – Excessive delegation of, if any – Constitution (One Hundred and First Amendment Act) 2016 – Central Goods and Services Tax, Act 2017 – Integrated Goods and Services Tax, Act 2017 – Whether the impugned notifications are ultra vires the IGST Act on the grounds of excessive delegation – Held: Legislature is required to perform its essential legislative functions – Once the skeletal structure of the policy is framed by the legislature, the details can emerge through delegated legislations – Legislature cannot delegate its ‘essential legislative functions – Essential legislative functions with respect to the GST law are the levy of tax, subject matter of tax, taxable person, rate of taxation and value for the purpose of taxation – Principles governing these essential aspects of taxation find place in the IGST Act – Both the IGST and CGST Act clearly define reverse charge, recipient and taxable persons – Thus, the essential legislative functions vis-à-vis reverse charge have not been delegated. Integrated Goods and Services Tax, Act 2017 – Central Goods and Services Tax, Act 2017 – ss. 2(30) and 8 – Impugned levy seeking to impose IGST on the ‘service’ aspect of the transaction, if in violation of the principle of ‘composite supply’ incorporated u/ s.2(30) r/w s.8 of the CGST Act – Held: Yes – Since the Indian importer is liable to pay IGST on the ‘composite supply’, comprising of supply of goods and supply of services of transportation, insurance, etc. in a CIF contract, a separate levy on the Indian importer for the ‘supply of services’ by the shipping line would be in violation of s.8 of the CGST Act – Double taxation. Central Goods and Services Tax, Act 2017 – s.2(93)(c) – Integrated Goods and Services Tax, Act 2017 – s.13(9) – Held: The only argument that supports the case of the appellant is that of s.13(9) of the IGST Act r/w s.2(93)(c) of the CGST Act which defines a “recipient” – s.13(9) of the IGST Act creates the deeming fiction of place of supply of service to be the destination of goods when they are transported by means other than mail or courier – No specific exemptions for importers have been carved out – This reasoning is accepted and read into the definition of recipient in s.2(93) of the CGST Act. Central Goods and Services Tax, Act 2017 – s.24(iii) – Integrated Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017 – ss.5(3), (4) – Held: Power of the Central Government to designate persons and categories of supply for reverse charge derives from ss.5(3) and 5(4) of the IGST Act and not s.24(iii) of the CGST Act which mandates the compulsorily registration as a logical corollary to ensure tax collection. Central Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017 – s.2(93) – Integrated Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017 – s.5(3) – Held: Interpreting the term “by the recipient” vis-à-vis the categories of goods and services identified in s.5(3) of the IGST Act should necessarily be governed by the principles governing the definition of “recipient” u/s.2(93) of the CGST Act. Interpretation of Statutes – Legislative history, Parliamentary debates, Committee Reports – Held: Though the traditional view of interpretation of statutes is that legislative history is not readily used in interpreting a law, the modern trend of thinking on the subject has enabled courts to look into the history of a legislation to understand the full purport of the words used and the mischief sought to be remedied by the law – Constitution of India – Articles 246A, 279A – Constitution (One Hundred and First Amendment Act) 2016 – Central Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017 – Integrated Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017. Words and Phrases: “Recommendations”– Constitution of India – Interpretation of, vis-à-vis the provisions of IGST Act and CGST Act – Integrated Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017 – Central Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017. ‘Cooperative federalism’; ‘Dual federalism’; ‘Fiscal federalism’ – Discussed",

Constitution of India – Constitution (One Hundred and First Amendment Act) 2016 – Articles 246 A and 279A – Central Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017 – ss.2(30), 2(93), 8 – Integrated Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017 – ss.2(11), 5(3), 13(9) – Impugned notifications (Notification 8/2017 and 10/2017) issued by Central Government on the advice of the GST Council levied an integrated tax at the rate of 5 per cent on the supply of specified services, including transportation of goods, in a vessel from a place outside India up to the customs station of clearance in India and categorized the recipient of services of supply of goods by a person in a nontaxable territory by a vessel to include an importer u/s. 2(26) of the Customs Act, 1962 – Respondents-importers of non coking coal on a Cost-Insurance-Freight (CIF) basis, filed writ petition challenging the notifications – High Court held that the impugned notifications are unconstitutional for exceeding the powers conferred by the IGST Act and the CGST Act – On appeal, held: Government in exercise of its power u/s.5(3) of the IGST Act issued the impugned Notification 10/2017 specifying the ‘categories of the supply’ which shall be subject to reverse charge – The notification, besides specifying the criteria also mentioned the corresponding recipient in those categories – The IGST Act and the CGST Act define reverse charge and prescribe the entity that is to be taxed for these purposes – The specification of the recipient- in this case the importer- by Notification 10/2017 is only clarificatory – The Government by notification did not specify a taxable entity different from that which is prescribed in s.5(3) of the IGST Act for the purposes of reverse charge – The impugned notification 10/2017 clearly specifies a taxable person who is liable to pay a reverse charge that is envisaged in the statute – Thus, the impugned notifications cannot be invalidated for an alleged failure to identify a taxable person – Further, the impugned notification 8/2017 cannot be struck down for excessive delegation when it prescribes 10 per cent of the CIF value as the mechanism for imposing tax on a reverse charge basis – Also, Constitution Bench decision in GVK Industries recognises the power of Parliament to legislate over events occurring extra-territorially – The only requirement imposed is that such an event must have a real connection to India – In the present case, the impugned levy on the supply of transportation service by the shipping line to the foreign exporter to import goods into India has a two-fold connection: first, the destination of the goods is India and thus, a clear territorial nexus is established with the event occurring outside the territory; and second, the services are rendered for the benefit of the Indian importer – Thus, the transaction does have a nexus with the territory of India – On a conjoint reading of ss.2(11) and 13(9) of the IGST Act, r/w ss.2(93) of the CGST Act, the import of goods by a CIF contract constitutes an “inter-state” supply which can be subject to IGST where the importer of such goods would be the recipient of shipping service – s.5(4) of the IGST Act enables the Central Government to specify a class of registered persons as the recipients, thereby conferring the power of creating a deeming fiction on the delegated legislation – Validity of the impugned notifications upheld u/ss.5(3) and 5(4) of the IGST Act – However, the impugned levy imposed on the ‘service’ aspect of the transaction is in violation of the principle of ‘composite supply’ enshrined u/s.2(30) r/w s.8, CGST Act and the overall scheme of the GST legislation – Double taxation – Customs Act 1962 – s.2(26). Integrated Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017 – Statutory provisions and Scheme of the Act – Discussed. Constitution of India – Constitution (One Hundred and First Amendment Act) 2016 – Legislative History – Discussed. Integrated Goods and Services Tax, Act 2017 – ss.2(11), 13(9) – Central Goods and Services Tax, Act 2017 – s.2(93) – Whether the import of goods by a CIF contract constitutes an “inter-state” supply which can be subject to IGST where the importer of such goods would be the recipient of shipping service – Held: Yes. Constitution of India – Power of Parliament to levy tax over events occurring extra-territorially – Discussed – Central Goods and Services Tax, Act 2017 – Integrated Goods and Services Tax, Act 2017. Central Goods and Services Tax, Act 2017 – s.2(93) – Integrated Goods and Services Tax, Act 2017 – ss.5(3), 5(4) – Plea of respondents that the amended and unamended s.5(4) do not save the impugned notifications since they still make the reference to the term “recipient” – Held: s.5(4) employs the language “as the recipient”, in contradistinction to s.5(3) of the IGST Act which uses “by the recipient” – Recipient includes the importer – Further, s.5(4) clarifies that it may designate a class of registered persons as the recipient, thereby broadening the scope of s.2(93) of the CGST Act which is anyway an inclusive definition since s.2 is prefaced with “unless the context otherwise requires” – It is settled law that nonreference of the source of power may not vitiate its exercise and application in given facts and circumstances of a case. Integrated Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017 – s.5(3), 13(9) – Central Goods and Services Tax, Act 2017– s.2(93)(c) – Whether the imports of goods on a CIF basis would also constitute import of shipping services, by way of deeming fiction – Held: s.5(3) of the IGST Act does not confer the powers on the Central Government to create a deeming fiction vis-à-vis who constitutes the recipient – It merely enables the Central Government to identify certain categories of goods and services, where the recipient of such services is subject to a reverse charge, as opposed to the usual mode of taxation where the supplier of the service is charged on a forward charge basis – However, s.13(9) of the IGST Act r/w s.2(93)(c) of the CGST Act inherently create a deeming fiction of the importer of goods to be the recipient of shipping service. Constitution of India – “Recommendations”– Articles 3, 109, 111, 113, 117, 203, 207, 255 and 274; Article 233; Articles 243I, 243Y, 280, 281, 338, 338B and 340; Article 263; Articles 270, 275, 344, 349 and 371A – Nature and contextual meaning of – Discussed. Constitution of India – Constitutional role and functions of the GST Council, in the context of the simultaneous legislative power conferred on Parliament and the State legislatures – Discussed. Constitution of India – Constitution (One Hundred and First Amendment Act) 2016 – Articles 246A, 279A – Held: GST Council is not only an avenue for the exercise of cooperative federalism but also for political contestation across party lines – Thus, the discussions in the GST Council impact both federalism and democracy – The constitutional design of the Constitution Amendment Act 2016 is sui generis since it introduces unique features of federalism – Article 246A treats the Centre and States as equal units by conferring a simultaneous power of enacting law on GST – Article 279A in constituting the GST Council envisions that neither the Centre nor the States can act independent of the other. Constitution of India – GST Law – Essential legislative functions – Excessive delegation of, if any – Constitution (One Hundred and First Amendment Act) 2016 – Central Goods and Services Tax, Act 2017 – Integrated Goods and Services Tax, Act 2017 – Whether the impugned notifications are ultra vires the IGST Act on the grounds of excessive delegation – Held: Legislature is required to perform its essential legislative functions – Once the skeletal structure of the policy is framed by the legislature, the details can emerge through delegated legislations – Legislature cannot delegate its ‘essential legislative functions – Essential legislative functions with respect to the GST law are the levy of tax, subject matter of tax, taxable person, rate of taxation and value for the purpose of taxation – Principles governing these essential aspects of taxation find place in the IGST Act – Both the IGST and CGST Act clearly define reverse charge, recipient and taxable persons – Thus, the essential legislative functions vis-à-vis reverse charge have not been delegated. Integrated Goods and Services Tax, Act 2017 – Central Goods and Services Tax, Act 2017 – ss. 2(30) and 8 – Impugned levy seeking to impose IGST on the ‘service’ aspect of the transaction, if in violation of the principle of ‘composite supply’ incorporated u/ s.2(30) r/w s.8 of the CGST Act – Held: Yes – Since the Indian importer is liable to pay IGST on the ‘composite supply’, comprising of supply of goods and supply of services of transportation, insurance, etc. in a CIF contract, a separate levy on the Indian importer for the ‘supply of services’ by the shipping line would be in violation of s.8 of the CGST Act – Double taxation. Central Goods and Services Tax, Act 2017 – s.2(93)(c) – Integrated Goods and Services Tax, Act 2017 – s.13(9) – Held: The only argument that supports the case of the appellant is that of s.13(9) of the IGST Act r/w s.2(93)(c) of the CGST Act which defines a “recipient” – s.13(9) of the IGST Act creates the deeming fiction of place of supply of service to be the destination of goods when they are transported by means other than mail or courier – No specific exemptions for importers have been carved out – This reasoning is accepted and read into the definition of recipient in s.2(93) of the CGST Act. Central Goods and Services Tax, Act 2017 – s.24(iii) – Integrated Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017 – ss.5(3), (4) – Held: Power of the Central Government to designate persons and categories of supply for reverse charge derives from ss.5(3) and 5(4) of the IGST Act and not s.24(iii) of the CGST Act which mandates the compulsorily registration as a logical corollary to ensure tax collection. Central Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017 – s.2(93) – Integrated Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017 – s.5(3) – Held: Interpreting the term “by the recipient” vis-à-vis the categories of goods and services identified in s.5(3) of the IGST Act should necessarily be governed by the principles governing the definition of “recipient” u/s.2(93) of the CGST Act. Interpretation of Statutes – Legislative history, Parliamentary debates, Committee Reports – Held: Though the traditional view of interpretation of statutes is that legislative history is not readily used in interpreting a law, the modern trend of thinking on the subject has enabled courts to look into the history of a legislation to understand the full purport of the words used and the mischief sought to be remedied by the law – Constitution of India – Articles 246A, 279A – Constitution (One Hundred and First Amendment Act) 2016 – Central Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017 – Integrated Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017. Words and Phrases: “Recommendations”– Constitution of India – Interpretation of, vis-à-vis the provisions of IGST Act and CGST Act – Integrated Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017 – Central Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017. ‘Cooperative federalism’; ‘Dual federalism’; ‘Fiscal federalism’ – Discussed",

        "HeadNote": "Constitution of India – Articles 246A and 279A – Constitution (One Hundred and First Amendment Act) 2016 – Central Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017 – Integrated Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017 – Recommendations of Goods and Services Tax Council – Nature of – Held: Recommendations of the GST Council are not binding on the Union and States – Deletion of Art. 279B and the inclusion of Art. 279(1) by the Constitution Amendment Act 2016 indicates that the Parliament intended for the recommendations of the GST Council to only have a persuasive value, particularly when interpreted along with the objective of the GST regime to foster cooperative federalism and harmony between the constituent units – Neither does Art. 279A begin with a non-obstante clause nor does Article 246A state that it is subject to the provisions of Article 279A – Parliament and the State legislatures possess simultaneous power to legislate on GST – Art. 246A does not envisage a repugnancy provision to resolve the inconsistencies between the Central and the State laws on GST – The ‘recommendations’ of the GST Council are the product of a collaborative dialogue involving the Union and States – They are recommendatory in nature – To regard them as binding edicts would disrupt fiscal federalism, where both the Union and the States are conferred equal power to legislate on GST – Government while exercising its rule-making power under the provisions of the CGST Act and IGST Act is bound by the recommendations of the GST Council – However, that does not mean that all the recommendations of the GST Council made by virtue of the power Art. 279A (4) are binding on the legislature’s power to enact primary legislations. Constitution of India – Constitution (One Hundred and First Amendment Act) 2016 – Articles 246 A and 279A – Central Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017 – ss.2(30), 2(93), 8 – Integrated Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017 – ss.2(11), 5(3), 13(9) – Impugned notifications (Notification 8/2017 and 10/2017) issued by Central Government on the advice of the GST Council levied an integrated tax at the rate of 5 per cent on the supply of specified services, including transportation of goods, in a vessel from a place outside India up to the customs station of clearance in India and categorized the recipient of services of supply of goods by a person in a nontaxable territory by a vessel to include an importer u/s. 2(26) of the Customs Act, 1962 – Respondents-importers of non coking coal on a Cost-Insurance-Freight (CIF) basis, filed writ petition challenging the notifications – High Court held that the impugned notifications are unconstitutional for exceeding the powers conferred by the IGST Act and the CGST Act – On appeal, held: Government in exercise of its power u/s.5(3) of the IGST Act issued the impugned Notification 10/2017 specifying the ‘categories of the supply’ which shall be subject to reverse charge – The notification, besides specifying the criteria also mentioned the corresponding recipient in those categories – The IGST Act and the CGST Act define reverse charge and prescribe the entity that is to be taxed for these purposes – The specification of the recipient- in this case the importer- by Notification 10/2017 is only clarificatory – The Government by notification did not specify a taxable entity different from that which is prescribed in s.5(3) of the IGST Act for the purposes of reverse charge – The impugned notification 10/2017 clearly specifies a taxable person who is liable to pay a reverse charge that is envisaged in the statute – Thus, the impugned notifications cannot be invalidated for an alleged failure to identify a taxable person – Further, the impugned notification 8/2017 cannot be struck down for excessive delegation when it prescribes 10 per cent of the CIF value as the mechanism for imposing tax on a reverse charge basis – Also, Constitution Bench decision in GVK Industries recognises the power of Parliament to legislate over events occurring extra-territorially – The only requirement imposed is that such an event must have a real connection to India – In the present case, the impugned levy on the supply of transportation service by the shipping line to the foreign exporter to import goods into India has a two-fold connection: first, the destination of the goods is India and thus, a clear territorial nexus is established with the event occurring outside the territory; and second, the services are rendered for the benefit of the Indian importer – Thus, the transaction does have a nexus with the territory of India – On a conjoint reading of ss.2(11) and 13(9) of the IGST Act, r/w ss.2(93) of the CGST Act, the import of goods by a CIF contract constitutes an “inter-state” supply which can be subject to IGST where the importer of such goods would be the recipient of shipping service – s.5(4) of the IGST Act enables the Central Government to specify a class of registered persons as the recipients, thereby conferring the power of creating a deeming fiction on the delegated legislation – Validity of the impugned notifications upheld u/ss.5(3) and 5(4) of the IGST Act – However, the impugned levy imposed on the ‘service’ aspect of the transaction is in violation of the principle of ‘composite supply’ enshrined u/s.2(30) r/w s.8, CGST Act and the overall scheme of the GST legislation – Double taxation – Customs Act 1962 – s.2(26). Integrated Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017 – Statutory provisions and Scheme of the Act – Discussed. Constitution of India – Constitution (One Hundred and First Amendment Act) 2016 – Legislative History – Discussed. Integrated Goods and Services Tax, Act 2017 – ss.2(11), 13(9) – Central Goods and Services Tax, Act 2017 – s.2(93) – Whether the import of goods by a CIF contract constitutes an “inter-state” supply which can be subject to IGST where the importer of such goods would be the recipient of shipping service – Held: Yes. Constitution of India – Power of Parliament to levy tax over events occurring extra-territorially – Discussed – Central Goods and Services Tax, Act 2017 – Integrated Goods and Services Tax, Act 2017. Central Goods and Services Tax, Act 2017 – s.2(93) – Integrated Goods and Services Tax, Act 2017 – ss.5(3), 5(4) – Plea of respondents that the amended and unamended s.5(4) do not save the impugned notifications since they still make the reference to the term “recipient” – Held: s.5(4) employs the language “as the recipient”, in contradistinction to s.5(3) of the IGST Act which uses “by the recipient” – Recipient includes the importer – Further, s.5(4) clarifies that it may designate a class of registered persons as the recipient, thereby broadening the scope of s.2(93) of the CGST Act which is anyway an inclusive definition since s.2 is prefaced with “unless the context otherwise requires” – It is settled law that nonreference of the source of power may not vitiate its exercise and application in given facts and circumstances of a case. Integrated Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017 – s.5(3), 13(9) – Central Goods and Services Tax, Act 2017– s.2(93)(c) – Whether the imports of goods on a CIF basis would also constitute import of shipping services, by way of deeming fiction – Held: s.5(3) of the IGST Act does not confer the powers on the Central Government to create a deeming fiction vis-à-vis who constitutes the recipient – It merely enables the Central Government to identify certain categories of goods and services, where the recipient of such services is subject to a reverse charge, as opposed to the usual mode of taxation where the supplier of the service is charged on a forward charge basis – However, s.13(9) of the IGST Act r/w s.2(93)(c) of the CGST Act inherently create a deeming fiction of the importer of goods to be the recipient of shipping service. Constitution of India – “Recommendations”– Articles 3, 109, 111, 113, 117, 203, 207, 255 and 274; Article 233; Articles 243I, 243Y, 280, 281, 338, 338B and 340; Article 263; Articles 270, 275, 344, 349 and 371A – Nature and contextual meaning of – Discussed. Constitution of India – Constitutional role and functions of the GST Council, in the context of the simultaneous legislative power conferred on Parliament and the State legislatures – Discussed. Constitution of India – Constitution (One Hundred and First Amendment Act) 2016 – Articles 246A, 279A – Held: GST Council is not only an avenue for the exercise of cooperative federalism but also for political contestation across party lines – Thus, the discussions in the GST Council impact both federalism and democracy – The constitutional design of the Constitution Amendment Act 2016 is sui generis since it introduces unique features of federalism – Article 246A treats the Centre and States as equal units by conferring a simultaneous power of enacting law on GST – Article 279A in constituting the GST Council envisions that neither the Centre nor the States can act independent of the other. Constitution of India – GST Law – Essential legislative functions – Excessive delegation of, if any – Constitution (One Hundred and First Amendment Act) 2016 – Central Goods and Services Tax, Act 2017 – Integrated Goods and Services Tax, Act 2017 – Whether the impugned notifications are ultra vires the IGST Act on the grounds of excessive delegation – Held: Legislature is required to perform its essential legislative functions – Once the skeletal structure of the policy is framed by the legislature, the details can emerge through delegated legislations – Legislature cannot delegate its ‘essential legislative functions – Essential legislative functions with respect to the GST law are the levy of tax, subject matter of tax, taxable person, rate of taxation and value for the purpose of taxation – Principles governing these essential aspects of taxation find place in the IGST Act – Both the IGST and CGST Act clearly define reverse charge, recipient and taxable persons – Thus, the essential legislative functions vis-à-vis reverse charge have not been delegated. Integrated Goods and Services Tax, Act 2017 – Central Goods and Services Tax, Act 2017 – ss. 2(30) and 8 – Impugned levy seeking to impose IGST on the ‘service’ aspect of the transaction, if in violation of the principle of ‘composite supply’ incorporated u/ s.2(30) r/w s.8 of the CGST Act – Held: Yes – Since the Indian importer is liable to pay IGST on the ‘composite supply’, comprising of supply of goods and supply of services of transportation, insurance, etc. in a CIF contract, a separate levy on the Indian importer for the ‘supply of services’ by the shipping line would be in violation of s.8 of the CGST Act – Double taxation. Central Goods and Services Tax, Act 2017 – s.2(93)(c) – Integrated Goods and Services Tax, Act 2017 – s.13(9) – Held: The only argument that supports the case of the appellant is that of s.13(9) of the IGST Act r/w s.2(93)(c) of the CGST Act which defines a “recipient” – s.13(9) of the IGST Act creates the deeming fiction of place of supply of service to be the destination of goods when they are transported by means other than mail or courier – No specific exemptions for importers have been carved out – This reasoning is accepted and read into the definition of recipient in s.2(93) of the CGST Act. Central Goods and Services Tax, Act 2017 – s.24(iii) – Integrated Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017 – ss.5(3), (4) – Held: Power of the Central Government to designate persons and categories of supply for reverse charge derives from ss.5(3) and 5(4) of the IGST Act and not s.24(iii) of the CGST Act which mandates the compulsorily registration as a logical corollary to ensure tax collection. Central Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017 – s.2(93) – Integrated Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017 – s.5(3) – Held: Interpreting the term “by the recipient” vis-à-vis the categories of goods and services identified in s.5(3) of the IGST Act should necessarily be governed by the principles governing the definition of “recipient” u/s.2(93) of the CGST Act. Interpretation of Statutes – Legislative history, Parliamentary debates, Committee Reports – Held: Though the traditional view of interpretation of statutes is that legislative history is not readily used in interpreting a law, the modern trend of thinking on the subject has enabled courts to look into the history of a legislation to understand the full purport of the words used and the mischief sought to be remedied by the law – Constitution of India – Articles 246A, 279A – Constitution (One Hundred and First Amendment Act) 2016 – Central Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017 – Integrated Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017. Words and Phrases: “Recommendations”– Constitution of India – Interpretation of, vis-à-vis the provisions of IGST Act and CGST Act – Integrated Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017 – Central Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017. ‘Cooperative federalism’; ‘Dual federalism’; ‘Fiscal federalism’ – Discussed",

Constitution of India – Constitution (One Hundred and First Amendment Act) 2016 – Articles 246 A and 279A – Central Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017 – ss.2(30), 2(93), 8 – Integrated Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017 – ss.2(11), 5(3), 13(9) – Impugned notifications (Notification 8/2017 and 10/2017) issued by Central Government on the advice of the GST Council levied an integrated tax at the rate of 5 per cent on the supply of specified services, including transportation of goods, in a vessel from a place outside India up to the customs station of clearance in India and categorized the recipient of services of supply of goods by a person in a nontaxable territory by a vessel to include an importer u/s. 2(26) of the Customs Act, 1962 – Respondents-importers of non coking coal on a Cost-Insurance-Freight (CIF) basis, filed writ petition challenging the notifications – High Court held that the impugned notifications are unconstitutional for exceeding the powers conferred by the IGST Act and the CGST Act – On appeal, held: Government in exercise of its power u/s.5(3) of the IGST Act issued the impugned Notification 10/2017 specifying the ‘categories of the supply’ which shall be subject to reverse charge – The notification, besides specifying the criteria also mentioned the corresponding recipient in those categories – The IGST Act and the CGST Act define reverse charge and prescribe the entity that is to be taxed for these purposes – The specification of the recipient- in this case the importer- by Notification 10/2017 is only clarificatory – The Government by notification did not specify a taxable entity different from that which is prescribed in s.5(3) of the IGST Act for the purposes of reverse charge – The impugned notification 10/2017 clearly specifies a taxable person who is liable to pay a reverse charge that is envisaged in the statute – Thus, the impugned notifications cannot be invalidated for an alleged failure to identify a taxable person – Further, the impugned notification 8/2017 cannot be struck down for excessive delegation when it prescribes 10 per cent of the CIF value as the mechanism for imposing tax on a reverse charge basis – Also, Constitution Bench decision in GVK Industries recognises the power of Parliament to legislate over events occurring extra-territorially – The only requirement imposed is that such an event must have a real connection to India – In the present case, the impugned levy on the supply of transportation service by the shipping line to the foreign exporter to import goods into India has a two-fold connection: first, the destination of the goods is India and thus, a clear territorial nexus is established with the event occurring outside the territory; and second, the services are rendered for the benefit of the Indian importer – Thus, the transaction does have a nexus with the territory of India – On a conjoint reading of ss.2(11) and 13(9) of the IGST Act, r/w ss.2(93) of the CGST Act, the import of goods by a CIF contract constitutes an “inter-state” supply which can be subject to IGST where the importer of such goods would be the recipient of shipping service – s.5(4) of the IGST Act enables the Central Government to specify a class of registered persons as the recipients, thereby conferring the power of creating a deeming fiction on the delegated legislation – Validity of the impugned notifications upheld u/ss.5(3) and 5(4) of the IGST Act – However, the impugned levy imposed on the ‘service’ aspect of the transaction is in violation of the principle of ‘composite supply’ enshrined u/s.2(30) r/w s.8, CGST Act and the overall scheme of the GST legislation – Double taxation – Customs Act 1962 – s.2(26). Integrated Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017 – Statutory provisions and Scheme of the Act – Discussed. Constitution of India – Constitution (One Hundred and First Amendment Act) 2016 – Legislative History – Discussed. Integrated Goods and Services Tax, Act 2017 – ss.2(11), 13(9) – Central Goods and Services Tax, Act 2017 – s.2(93) – Whether the import of goods by a CIF contract constitutes an “inter-state” supply which can be subject to IGST where the importer of such goods would be the recipient of shipping service – Held: Yes. Constitution of India – Power of Parliament to levy tax over events occurring extra-territorially – Discussed – Central Goods and Services Tax, Act 2017 – Integrated Goods and Services Tax, Act 2017. Central Goods and Services Tax, Act 2017 – s.2(93) – Integrated Goods and Services Tax, Act 2017 – ss.5(3), 5(4) – Plea of respondents that the amended and unamended s.5(4) do not save the impugned notifications since they still make the reference to the term “recipient” – Held: s.5(4) employs the language “as the recipient”, in contradistinction to s.5(3) of the IGST Act which uses “by the recipient” – Recipient includes the importer – Further, s.5(4) clarifies that it may designate a class of registered persons as the recipient, thereby broadening the scope of s.2(93) of the CGST Act which is anyway an inclusive definition since s.2 is prefaced with “unless the context otherwise requires” – It is settled law that nonreference of the source of power may not vitiate its exercise and application in given facts and circumstances of a case. Integrated Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017 – s.5(3), 13(9) – Central Goods and Services Tax, Act 2017– s.2(93)(c) – Whether the imports of goods on a CIF basis would also constitute import of shipping services, by way of deeming fiction – Held: s.5(3) of the IGST Act does not confer the powers on the Central Government to create a deeming fiction vis-à-vis who constitutes the recipient – It merely enables the Central Government to identify certain categories of goods and services, where the recipient of such services is subject to a reverse charge, as opposed to the usual mode of taxation where the supplier of the service is charged on a forward charge basis – However, s.13(9) of the IGST Act r/w s.2(93)(c) of the CGST Act inherently create a deeming fiction of the importer of goods to be the recipient of shipping service. Constitution of India – “Recommendations”– Articles 3, 109, 111, 113, 117, 203, 207, 255 and 274; Article 233; Articles 243I, 243Y, 280, 281, 338, 338B and 340; Article 263; Articles 270, 275, 344, 349 and 371A – Nature and contextual meaning of – Discussed. Constitution of India – Constitutional role and functions of the GST Council, in the context of the simultaneous legislative power conferred on Parliament and the State legislatures – Discussed. Constitution of India – Constitution (One Hundred and First Amendment Act) 2016 – Articles 246A, 279A – Held: GST Council is not only an avenue for the exercise of cooperative federalism but also for political contestation across party lines – Thus, the discussions in the GST Council impact both federalism and democracy – The constitutional design of the Constitution Amendment Act 2016 is sui generis since it introduces unique features of federalism – Article 246A treats the Centre and States as equal units by conferring a simultaneous power of enacting law on GST – Article 279A in constituting the GST Council envisions that neither the Centre nor the States can act independent of the other. Constitution of India – GST Law – Essential legislative functions – Excessive delegation of, if any – Constitution (One Hundred and First Amendment Act) 2016 – Central Goods and Services Tax, Act 2017 – Integrated Goods and Services Tax, Act 2017 – Whether the impugned notifications are ultra vires the IGST Act on the grounds of excessive delegation – Held: Legislature is required to perform its essential legislative functions – Once the skeletal structure of the policy is framed by the legislature, the details can emerge through delegated legislations – Legislature cannot delegate its ‘essential legislative functions – Essential legislative functions with respect to the GST law are the levy of tax, subject matter of tax, taxable person, rate of taxation and value for the purpose of taxation – Principles governing these essential aspects of taxation find place in the IGST Act – Both the IGST and CGST Act clearly define reverse charge, recipient and taxable persons – Thus, the essential legislative functions vis-à-vis reverse charge have not been delegated. Integrated Goods and Services Tax, Act 2017 – Central Goods and Services Tax, Act 2017 – ss. 2(30) and 8 – Impugned levy seeking to impose IGST on the ‘service’ aspect of the transaction, if in violation of the principle of ‘composite supply’ incorporated u/ s.2(30) r/w s.8 of the CGST Act – Held: Yes – Since the Indian importer is liable to pay IGST on the ‘composite supply’, comprising of supply of goods and supply of services of transportation, insurance, etc. in a CIF contract, a separate levy on the Indian importer for the ‘supply of services’ by the shipping line would be in violation of s.8 of the CGST Act – Double taxation. Central Goods and Services Tax, Act 2017 – s.2(93)(c) – Integrated Goods and Services Tax, Act 2017 – s.13(9) – Held: The only argument that supports the case of the appellant is that of s.13(9) of the IGST Act r/w s.2(93)(c) of the CGST Act which defines a “recipient” – s.13(9) of the IGST Act creates the deeming fiction of place of supply of service to be the destination of goods when they are transported by means other than mail or courier – No specific exemptions for importers have been carved out – This reasoning is accepted and read into the definition of recipient in s.2(93) of the CGST Act. Central Goods and Services Tax, Act 2017 – s.24(iii) – Integrated Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017 – ss.5(3), (4) – Held: Power of the Central Government to designate persons and categories of supply for reverse charge derives from ss.5(3) and 5(4) of the IGST Act and not s.24(iii) of the CGST Act which mandates the compulsorily registration as a logical corollary to ensure tax collection. Central Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017 – s.2(93) – Integrated Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017 – s.5(3) – Held: Interpreting the term “by the recipient” vis-à-vis the categories of goods and services identified in s.5(3) of the IGST Act should necessarily be governed by the principles governing the definition of “recipient” u/s.2(93) of the CGST Act. Interpretation of Statutes – Legislative history, Parliamentary debates, Committee Reports – Held: Though the traditional view of interpretation of statutes is that legislative history is not readily used in interpreting a law, the modern trend of thinking on the subject has enabled courts to look into the history of a legislation to understand the full purport of the words used and the mischief sought to be remedied by the law – Constitution of India – Articles 246A, 279A – Constitution (One Hundred and First Amendment Act) 2016 – Central Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017 – Integrated Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017. Words and Phrases: “Recommendations”– Constitution of India – Interpretation of, vis-à-vis the provisions of IGST Act and CGST Act – Integrated Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017 – Central Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017. ‘Cooperative federalism’; ‘Dual federalism’; ‘Fiscal federalism’ – Discussed",

        "HeadNote": "Constitution of India – Articles 246A and 279A – Constitution (One Hundred and First Amendment Act) 2016 – Central Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017 – Integrated Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017 – Recommendations of Goods and Services Tax Council – Nature of – Held: Recommendations of the GST Council are not binding on the Union and States – Deletion of Art. 279B and the inclusion of Art. 279(1) by the Constitution Amendment Act 2016 indicates that the Parliament intended for the recommendations of the GST Council to only have a persuasive value, particularly when interpreted along with the objective of the GST regime to foster cooperative federalism and harmony between the constituent units – Neither does Art. 279A begin with a non-obstante clause nor does Article 246A state that it is subject to the provisions of Article 279A – Parliament and the State legislatures possess simultaneous power to legislate on GST – Art. 246A does not envisage a repugnancy provision to resolve the inconsistencies between the Central and the State laws on GST – The ‘recommendations’ of the GST Council are the product of a collaborative dialogue involving the Union and States – They are recommendatory in nature – To regard them as binding edicts would disrupt fiscal federalism, where both the Union and the States are conferred equal power to legislate on GST – Government while exercising its rule-making power under the provisions of the CGST Act and IGST Act is bound by the recommendations of the GST Council – However, that does not mean that all the recommendations of the GST Council made by virtue of the power Art. 279A (4) are binding on the legislature’s power to enact primary legislations. Constitution of India – Constitution (One Hundred and First Amendment Act) 2016 – Articles 246 A and 279A – Central Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017 – ss.2(30), 2(93), 8 – Integrated Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017 – ss.2(11), 5(3), 13(9) – Impugned notifications (Notification 8/2017 and 10/2017) issued by Central Government on the advice of the GST Council levied an integrated tax at the rate of 5 per cent on the supply of specified services, including transportation of goods, in a vessel from a place outside India up to the customs station of clearance in India and categorized the recipient of services of supply of goods by a person in a nontaxable territory by a vessel to include an importer u/s. 2(26) of the Customs Act, 1962 – Respondents-importers of non coking coal on a Cost-Insurance-Freight (CIF) basis, filed writ petition challenging the notifications – High Court held that the impugned notifications are unconstitutional for exceeding the powers conferred by the IGST Act and the CGST Act – On appeal, held: Government in exercise of its power u/s.5(3) of the IGST Act issued the impugned Notification 10/2017 specifying the ‘categories of the supply’ which shall be subject to reverse charge – The notification, besides specifying the criteria also mentioned the corresponding recipient in those categories – The IGST Act and the CGST Act define reverse charge and prescribe the entity that is to be taxed for these purposes – The specification of the recipient- in this case the importer- by Notification 10/2017 is only clarificatory – The Government by notification did not specify a taxable entity different from that which is prescribed in s.5(3) of the IGST Act for the purposes of reverse charge – The impugned notification 10/2017 clearly specifies a taxable person who is liable to pay a reverse charge that is envisaged in the statute – Thus, the impugned notifications cannot be invalidated for an alleged failure to identify a taxable person – Further, the impugned notification 8/2017 cannot be struck down for excessive delegation when it prescribes 10 per cent of the CIF value as the mechanism for imposing tax on a reverse charge basis – Also, Constitution Bench decision in GVK Industries recognises the power of Parliament to legislate over events occurring extra-territorially – The only requirement imposed is that such an event must have a real connection to India – In the present case, the impugned levy on the supply of transportation service by the shipping line to the foreign exporter to import goods into India has a two-fold connection: first, the destination of the goods is India and thus, a clear territorial nexus is established with the event occurring outside the territory; and second, the services are rendered for the benefit of the Indian importer – Thus, the transaction does have a nexus with the territory of India – On a conjoint reading of ss.2(11) and 13(9) of the IGST Act, r/w ss.2(93) of the CGST Act, the import of goods by a CIF contract constitutes an “inter-state” supply which can be subject to IGST where the importer of such goods would be the recipient of shipping service – s.5(4) of the IGST Act enables the Central Government to specify a class of registered persons as the recipients, thereby conferring the power of creating a deeming fiction on the delegated legislation – Validity of the impugned notifications upheld u/ss.5(3) and 5(4) of the IGST Act – However, the impugned levy imposed on the ‘service’ aspect of the transaction is in violation of the principle of ‘composite supply’ enshrined u/s.2(30) r/w s.8, CGST Act and the overall scheme of the GST legislation – Double taxation – Customs Act 1962 – s.2(26). Integrated Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017 – Statutory provisions and Scheme of the Act – Discussed. Constitution of India – Constitution (One Hundred and First Amendment Act) 2016 – Legislative History – Discussed. Integrated Goods and Services Tax, Act 2017 – ss.2(11), 13(9) – Central Goods and Services Tax, Act 2017 – s.2(93) – Whether the import of goods by a CIF contract constitutes an “inter-state” supply which can be subject to IGST where the importer of such goods would be the recipient of shipping service – Held: Yes. Constitution of India – Power of Parliament to levy tax over events occurring extra-territorially – Discussed – Central Goods and Services Tax, Act 2017 – Integrated Goods and Services Tax, Act 2017. Central Goods and Services Tax, Act 2017 – s.2(93) – Integrated Goods and Services Tax, Act 2017 – ss.5(3), 5(4) – Plea of respondents that the amended and unamended s.5(4) do not save the impugned notifications since they still make the reference to the term “recipient” – Held: s.5(4) employs the language “as the recipient”, in contradistinction to s.5(3) of the IGST Act which uses “by the recipient” – Recipient includes the importer – Further, s.5(4) clarifies that it may designate a class of registered persons as the recipient, thereby broadening the scope of s.2(93) of the CGST Act which is anyway an inclusive definition since s.2 is prefaced with “unless the context otherwise requires” – It is settled law that nonreference of the source of power may not vitiate its exercise and application in given facts and circumstances of a case. Integrated Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017 – s.5(3), 13(9) – Central Goods and Services Tax, Act 2017– s.2(93)(c) – Whether the imports of goods on a CIF basis would also constitute import of shipping services, by way of deeming fiction – Held: s.5(3) of the IGST Act does not confer the powers on the Central Government to create a deeming fiction vis-à-vis who constitutes the recipient – It merely enables the Central Government to identify certain categories of goods and services, where the recipient of such services is subject to a reverse charge, as opposed to the usual mode of taxation where the supplier of the service is charged on a forward charge basis – However, s.13(9) of the IGST Act r/w s.2(93)(c) of the CGST Act inherently create a deeming fiction of the importer of goods to be the recipient of shipping service. Constitution of India – “Recommendations”– Articles 3, 109, 111, 113, 117, 203, 207, 255 and 274; Article 233; Articles 243I, 243Y, 280, 281, 338, 338B and 340; Article 263; Articles 270, 275, 344, 349 and 371A – Nature and contextual meaning of – Discussed. Constitution of India – Constitutional role and functions of the GST Council, in the context of the simultaneous legislative power conferred on Parliament and the State legislatures – Discussed. Constitution of India – Constitution (One Hundred and First Amendment Act) 2016 – Articles 246A, 279A – Held: GST Council is not only an avenue for the exercise of cooperative federalism but also for political contestation across party lines – Thus, the discussions in the GST Council impact both federalism and democracy – The constitutional design of the Constitution Amendment Act 2016 is sui generis since it introduces unique features of federalism – Article 246A treats the Centre and States as equal units by conferring a simultaneous power of enacting law on GST – Article 279A in constituting the GST Council envisions that neither the Centre nor the States can act independent of the other. Constitution of India – GST Law – Essential legislative functions – Excessive delegation of, if any – Constitution (One Hundred and First Amendment Act) 2016 – Central Goods and Services Tax, Act 2017 – Integrated Goods and Services Tax, Act 2017 – Whether the impugned notifications are ultra vires the IGST Act on the grounds of excessive delegation – Held: Legislature is required to perform its essential legislative functions – Once the skeletal structure of the policy is framed by the legislature, the details can emerge through delegated legislations – Legislature cannot delegate its ‘essential legislative functions – Essential legislative functions with respect to the GST law are the levy of tax, subject matter of tax, taxable person, rate of taxation and value for the purpose of taxation – Principles governing these essential aspects of taxation find place in the IGST Act – Both the IGST and CGST Act clearly define reverse charge, recipient and taxable persons – Thus, the essential legislative functions vis-à-vis reverse charge have not been delegated. Integrated Goods and Services Tax, Act 2017 – Central Goods and Services Tax, Act 2017 – ss. 2(30) and 8 – Impugned levy seeking to impose IGST on the ‘service’ aspect of the transaction, if in violation of the principle of ‘composite supply’ incorporated u/ s.2(30) r/w s.8 of the CGST Act – Held: Yes – Since the Indian importer is liable to pay IGST on the ‘composite supply’, comprising of supply of goods and supply of services of transportation, insurance, etc. in a CIF contract, a separate levy on the Indian importer for the ‘supply of services’ by the shipping line would be in violation of s.8 of the CGST Act – Double taxation. Central Goods and Services Tax, Act 2017 – s.2(93)(c) – Integrated Goods and Services Tax, Act 2017 – s.13(9) – Held: The only argument that supports the case of the appellant is that of s.13(9) of the IGST Act r/w s.2(93)(c) of the CGST Act which defines a “recipient” – s.13(9) of the IGST Act creates the deeming fiction of place of supply of service to be the destination of goods when they are transported by means other than mail or courier – No specific exemptions for importers have been carved out – This reasoning is accepted and read into the definition of recipient in s.2(93) of the CGST Act. Central Goods and Services Tax, Act 2017 – s.24(iii) – Integrated Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017 – ss.5(3), (4) – Held: Power of the Central Government to designate persons and categories of supply for reverse charge derives from ss.5(3) and 5(4) of the IGST Act and not s.24(iii) of the CGST Act which mandates the compulsorily registration as a logical corollary to ensure tax collection. Central Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017 – s.2(93) – Integrated Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017 – s.5(3) – Held: Interpreting the term “by the recipient” vis-à-vis the categories of goods and services identified in s.5(3) of the IGST Act should necessarily be governed by the principles governing the definition of “recipient” u/s.2(93) of the CGST Act. Interpretation of Statutes – Legislative history, Parliamentary debates, Committee Reports – Held: Though the traditional view of interpretation of statutes is that legislative history is not readily used in interpreting a law, the modern trend of thinking on the subject has enabled courts to look into the history of a legislation to understand the full purport of the words used and the mischief sought to be remedied by the law – Constitution of India – Articles 246A, 279A – Constitution (One Hundred and First Amendment Act) 2016 – Central Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017 – Integrated Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017.

        "HeadNote": "Constitution of India – Articles 246A and 279A – Constitution (One Hundred and First Amendment Act) 2016 – Central Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017 – Integrated Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017 – Recommendations of Goods and Services Tax Council – Nature of – Held: Recommendations of the GST Council are not binding on the Union and States – Deletion of Art. 279B and the inclusion of Art. 279(1) by the Constitution Amendment Act 2016 indicates that the Parliament intended for the recommendations of the GST Council to only have a persuasive value, particularly when interpreted along with the objective of the GST regime to foster cooperative federalism and harmony between the constituent units – Neither does Art. 279A begin with a non-obstante clause nor does Article 246A state that it is subject to the provisions of Article 279A – Parliament and the State legislatures possess simultaneous power to legislate on GST – Art. 246A does not envisage a repugnancy provision to resolve the inconsistencies between the Central and the State laws on GST – The ‘recommendations’ of the GST Council are the product of a collaborative dialogue involving the Union and States – They are recommendatory in nature – To regard them as binding edicts would disrupt fiscal federalism, where both the Union and the States are conferred equal power to legislate on GST – Government while exercising its rule-making power under the provisions of the CGST Act and IGST Act is bound by the recommendations of the GST Council – However, that does not mean that all the recommendations of the GST Council made by virtue of the power Art. 279A (4) are binding on the legislature’s power to enact primary legislations. Constitution of India – Constitution (One Hundred and First Amendment Act) 2016 – Articles 246 A and 279A – Central Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017 – ss.2(30), 2(93), 8 – Integrated Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017 – ss.2(11), 5(3), 13(9) – Impugned notifications (Notification 8/2017 and 10/2017) issued by Central Government on the advice of the GST Council levied an integrated tax at the rate of 5 per cent on the supply of specified services, including transportation of goods, in a vessel from a place outside India up to the customs station of clearance in India and categorized the recipient of services of supply of goods by a person in a nontaxable territory by a vessel to include an importer u/s. 2(26) of the Customs Act, 1962 – Respondents-importers of non coking coal on a Cost-Insurance-Freight (CIF) basis, filed writ petition challenging the notifications – High Court held that the impugned notifications are unconstitutional for exceeding the powers conferred by the IGST Act and the CGST Act – On appeal, held: Government in exercise of its power u/s.5(3) of the IGST Act issued the impugned Notification 10/2017 specifying the ‘categories of the supply’ which shall be subject to reverse charge – The notification, besides specifying the criteria also mentioned the corresponding recipient in those categories – The IGST Act and the CGST Act define reverse charge and prescribe the entity that is to be taxed for these purposes – The specification of the recipient- in this case the importer- by Notification 10/2017 is only clarificatory – The Government by notification did not specify a taxable entity different from that which is prescribed in s.5(3) of the IGST Act for the purposes of reverse charge – The impugned notification 10/2017 clearly specifies a taxable person who is liable to pay a reverse charge that is envisaged in the statute – Thus, the impugned notifications cannot be invalidated for an alleged failure to identify a taxable person – Further, the impugned notification 8/2017 cannot be struck down for excessive delegation when it prescribes 10 per cent of the CIF value as the mechanism for imposing tax on a reverse charge basis – Also, Constitution Bench decision in GVK Industries recognises the power of Parliament to legislate over events occurring extra-territorially – The only requirement imposed is that such an event must have a real connection to India – In the present case, the impugned levy on the supply of transportation service by the shipping line to the foreign exporter to import goods into India has a two-fold connection: first, the destination of the goods is India and thus, a clear territorial nexus is established with the event occurring outside the territory; and second, the services are rendered for the benefit of the Indian importer – Thus, the transaction does have a nexus with the territory of India – On a conjoint reading of ss.2(11) and 13(9) of the IGST Act, r/w ss.2(93) of the CGST Act, the import of goods by a CIF contract constitutes an “inter-state” supply which can be subject to IGST where the importer of such goods would be the recipient of shipping service – s.5(4) of the IGST Act enables the Central Government to specify a class of registered persons as the recipients, thereby conferring the power of creating a deeming fiction on the delegated legislation – Validity of the impugned notifications upheld u/ss.5(3) and 5(4) of the IGST Act – However, the impugned levy imposed on the ‘service’ aspect of the transaction is in violation of the principle of ‘composite supply’ enshrined u/s.2(30) r/w s.8, CGST Act and the overall scheme of the GST legislation – Double taxation – Customs Act 1962 – s.2(26). Integrated Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017 – Statutory provisions and Scheme of the Act – Discussed. Constitution of India – Constitution (One Hundred and First Amendment Act) 2016 – Legislative History – Discussed. Integrated Goods and Services Tax, Act 2017 – ss.2(11), 13(9) – Central Goods and Services Tax, Act 2017 – s.2(93) – Whether the import of goods by a CIF contract constitutes an “inter-state” supply which can be subject to IGST where the importer of such goods would be the recipient of shipping service – Held: Yes. Constitution of India – Power of Parliament to levy tax over events occurring extra-territorially – Discussed – Central Goods and Services Tax, Act 2017 – Integrated Goods and Services Tax, Act 2017. Central Goods and Services Tax, Act 2017 – s.2(93) – Integrated Goods and Services Tax, Act 2017 – ss.5(3), 5(4) – Plea of respondents that the amended and unamended s.5(4) do not save the impugned notifications since they still make the reference to the term “recipient” – Held: s.5(4) employs the language “as the recipient”, in contradistinction to s.5(3) of the IGST Act which uses “by the recipient” – Recipient includes the importer – Further, s.5(4) clarifies that it may designate a class of registered persons as the recipient, thereby broadening the scope of s.2(93) of the CGST Act which is anyway an inclusive definition since s.2 is prefaced with “unless the context otherwise requires” – It is settled law that nonreference of the source of power may not vitiate its exercise and application in given facts and circumstances of a case. Integrated Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017 – s.5(3), 13(9) – Central Goods and Services Tax, Act 2017– s.2(93)(c) – Whether the imports of goods on a CIF basis would also constitute import of shipping services, by way of deeming fiction – Held: s.5(3) of the IGST Act does not confer the powers on the Central Government to create a deeming fiction vis-à-vis who constitutes the recipient – It merely enables the Central Government to identify certain categories of goods and services, where the recipient of such services is subject to a reverse charge, as opposed to the usual mode of taxation where the supplier of the service is charged on a forward charge basis – However, s.13(9) of the IGST Act r/w s.2(93)(c) of the CGST Act inherently create a deeming fiction of the importer of goods to be the recipient of shipping service. Constitution of India – “Recommendations”– Articles 3, 109, 111, 113, 117, 203, 207, 255 and 274; Article 233; Articles 243I, 243Y, 280, 281, 338, 338B and 340; Article 263; Articles 270, 275, 344, 349 and 371A – Nature and contextual meaning of – Discussed. Constitution of India – Constitutional role and functions of the GST Council, in the context of the simultaneous legislative power conferred on Parliament and the State legislatures – Discussed. Constitution of India – Constitution (One Hundred and First Amendment Act) 2016 – Articles 246A, 279A – Held: GST Council is not only an avenue for the exercise of cooperative federalism but also for political contestation across party lines – Thus, the discussions in the GST Council impact both federalism and democracy – The constitutional design of the Constitution Amendment Act 2016 is sui generis since it introduces unique features of federalism – Article 246A treats the Centre and States as equal units by conferring a simultaneous power of enacting law on GST – Article 279A in constituting the GST Council envisions that neither the Centre nor the States can act independent of the other. Constitution of India – GST Law – Essential legislative functions – Excessive delegation of, if any – Constitution (One Hundred and First Amendment Act) 2016 – Central Goods and Services Tax, Act 2017 – Integrated Goods and Services Tax, Act 2017 – Whether the impugned notifications are ultra vires the IGST Act on the grounds of excessive delegation – Held: Legislature is required to perform its essential legislative functions – Once the skeletal structure of the policy is framed by the legislature, the details can emerge through delegated legislations – Legislature cannot delegate its ‘essential legislative functions – Essential legislative functions with respect to the GST law are the levy of tax, subject matter of tax, taxable person, rate of taxation and value for the purpose of taxation – Principles governing these essential aspects of taxation find place in the IGST Act – Both the IGST and CGST Act clearly define reverse charge, recipient and taxable persons – Thus, the essential legislative functions vis-à-vis reverse charge have not been delegated. Integrated Goods and Services Tax, Act 2017 – Central Goods and Services Tax, Act 2017 – ss. 2(30) and 8 – Impugned levy seeking to impose IGST on the ‘service’ aspect of the transaction, if in violation of the principle of ‘composite supply’ incorporated u/ s.2(30) r/w s.8 of the CGST Act – Held: Yes – Since the Indian importer is liable to pay IGST on the ‘composite supply’, comprising of supply of goods and supply of services of transportation, insurance, etc. in a CIF contract, a separate levy on the Indian importer for the ‘supply of services’ by the shipping line would be in violation of s.8 of the CGST Act – Double taxation. Central Goods and Services Tax, Act 2017 – s.2(93)(c) – Integrated Goods and Services Tax, Act 2017 – s.13(9) – Held: The only argument that supports the case of the appellant is that of s.13(9) of the IGST Act r/w s.2(93)(c) of the CGST Act which defines a “recipient” – s.13(9) of the IGST Act creates the deeming fiction of place of supply of service to be the destination of goods when they are transported by means other than mail or courier – No specific exemptions for importers have been carved out – This reasoning is accepted and read into the definition of recipient in s.2(93) of the CGST Act. Central Goods and Services Tax, Act 2017 – s.24(iii) – Integrated Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017 – ss.5(3), (4) – Held: Power of the Central Government to designate persons and categories of supply for reverse charge derives from ss.5(3) and 5(4) of the IGST Act and not s.24(iii) of the CGST Act which mandates the compulsorily registration as a logical corollary to ensure tax collection. Central Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017 – s.2(93) – Integrated Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017 – s.5(3) – Held: Interpreting the term “by the recipient” vis-à-vis the categories of goods and services identified in s.5(3) of the IGST Act should necessarily be governed by the principles governing the definition of “recipient” u/s.2(93) of the CGST Act. Interpretation of Statutes – Legislative history, Parliamentary debates, Committee Reports – Held: Though the traditional view of interpretation of statutes is that legislative history is not readily used in interpreting a law, the modern trend of thinking on the subject has enabled courts to look into the history of a legislation to understand the full purport of the words used and the mischief sought to be remedied by the law – Constitution of India – Articles 246A, 279A – Constitution (One Hundred and First Amendment Act) 2016 – Central Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017 – Integrated Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017. Words and Phrases: “Recommendations”– Constitution of India – Interpretation of, vis-à-vis the provisions of IGST Act and CGST Act – Integrated Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017 – Central Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017. ‘Cooperative federalism’; ‘Dual federalism’; ‘Fiscal federalism’ – Discussed",

Constitution of India – Constitution (One Hundred and First Amendment Act) 2016 – Articles 246 A and 279A – Central Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017 – ss.2(30), 2(93), 8 – Integrated Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017 – ss.2(11), 5(3), 13(9) – Impugned notifications (Notification 8/2017 and 10/2017) issued by Central Government on the advice of the GST Council levied an integrated tax at the rate of 5 per cent on the supply of specified services, including transportation of goods, in a vessel from a place outside India up to the customs station of clearance in India and categorized the recipient of services of supply of goods by a person in a nontaxable territory by a vessel to include an importer u/s. 2(26) of the Customs Act, 1962 – Respondents-importers of non coking coal on a Cost-Insurance-Freight (CIF) basis, filed writ petition challenging the notifications – High Court held that the impugned notifications are unconstitutional for exceeding the powers conferred by the IGST Act and the CGST Act – On appeal, held: Government in exercise of its power u/s.5(3) of the IGST Act issued the impugned Notification 10/2017 specifying the ‘categories of the supply’ which shall be subject to reverse charge – The notification, besides specifying the criteria also mentioned the corresponding recipient in those categories – The IGST Act and the CGST Act define reverse charge and prescribe the entity that is to be taxed for these purposes – The specification of the recipient- in this case the importer- by Notification 10/2017 is only clarificatory – The Government by notification did not specify a taxable entity different from that which is prescribed in s.5(3) of the IGST Act for the purposes of reverse charge – The impugned notification 10/2017 clearly specifies a taxable person who is liable to pay a reverse charge that is envisaged in the statute – Thus, the impugned notifications cannot be invalidated for an alleged failure to identify a taxable person – Further, the impugned notification 8/2017 cannot be struck down for excessive delegation when it prescribes 10 per cent of the CIF value as the mechanism for imposing tax on a reverse charge basis – Also, Constitution Bench decision in GVK Industries recognises the power of Parliament to legislate over events occurring extra-territorially – The only requirement imposed is that such an event must have a real connection to India – In the present case, the impugned levy on the supply of transportation service by the shipping line to the foreign exporter to import goods into India has a two-fold connection: first, the destination of the goods is India and thus, a clear territorial nexus is established with the event occurring outside the territory; and second, the services are rendered for the benefit of the Indian importer – Thus, the transaction does have a nexus with the territory of India – On a conjoint reading of ss.2(11) and 13(9) of the IGST Act, r/w ss.2(93) of the CGST Act, the import of goods by a CIF contract constitutes an “inter-state” supply which can be subject to IGST where the importer of such goods would be the recipient of shipping service – s.5(4) of the IGST Act enables the Central Government to specify a class of registered persons as the recipients, thereby conferring the power of creating a deeming fiction on the delegated legislation – Validity of the impugned notifications upheld u/ss.5(3) and 5(4) of the IGST Act – However, the impugned levy imposed on the ‘service’ aspect of the transaction is in violation of the principle of ‘composite supply’ enshrined u/s.2(30) r/w s.8, CGST Act and the overall scheme of the GST legislation – Double taxation – Customs Act 1962 – s.2(26). Integrated Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017 – Statutory provisions and Scheme of the Act – Discussed. Constitution of India – Constitution (One Hundred and First Amendment Act) 2016 – Legislative History – Discussed. Integrated Goods and Services Tax, Act 2017 – ss.2(11), 13(9) – Central Goods and Services Tax, Act 2017 – s.2(93) – Whether the import of goods by a CIF contract constitutes an “inter-state” supply which can be subject to IGST where the importer of such goods would be the recipient of shipping service – Held: Yes. Constitution of India – Power of Parliament to levy tax over events occurring extra-territorially – Discussed – Central Goods and Services Tax, Act 2017 – Integrated Goods and Services Tax, Act 2017. Central Goods and Services Tax, Act 2017 – s.2(93) – Integrated Goods and Services Tax, Act 2017 – ss.5(3), 5(4) – Plea of respondents that the amended and unamended s.5(4) do not save the impugned notifications since they still make the reference to the term “recipient” – Held: s.5(4) employs the language “as the recipient”, in contradistinction to s.5(3) of the IGST Act which uses “by the recipient” – Recipient includes the importer – Further, s.5(4) clarifies that it may designate a class of registered persons as the recipient, thereby broadening the scope of s.2(93) of the CGST Act which is anyway an inclusive definition since s.2 is prefaced with “unless the context otherwise requires” – It is settled law that nonreference of the source of power may not vitiate its exercise and application in given facts and circumstances of a case. Integrated Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017 – s.5(3), 13(9) – Central Goods and Services Tax, Act 2017– s.2(93)(c) – Whether the imports of goods on a CIF basis would also constitute import of shipping services, by way of deeming fiction – Held: s.5(3) of the IGST Act does not confer the powers on the Central Government to create a deeming fiction vis-à-vis who constitutes the recipient – It merely enables the Central Government to identify certain categories of goods and services, where the recipient of such services is subject to a reverse charge, as opposed to the usual mode of taxation where the supplier of the service is charged on a forward charge basis – However, s.13(9) of the IGST Act r/w s.2(93)(c) of the CGST Act inherently create a deeming fiction of the importer of goods to be the recipient of shipping service. Constitution of India – “Recommendations”– Articles 3, 109, 111, 113, 117, 203, 207, 255 and 274; Article 233; Articles 243I, 243Y, 280, 281, 338, 338B and 340; Article 263; Articles 270, 275, 344, 349 and 371A – Nature and contextual meaning of – Discussed. Constitution of India – Constitutional role and functions of the GST Council, in the context of the simultaneous legislative power conferred on Parliament and the State legislatures – Discussed. Constitution of India – Constitution (One Hundred and First Amendment Act) 2016 – Articles 246A, 279A – Held: GST Council is not only an avenue for the exercise of cooperative federalism but also for political contestation across party lines – Thus, the discussions in the GST Council impact both federalism and democracy – The constitutional design of the Constitution Amendment Act 2016 is sui generis since it introduces unique features of federalism – Article 246A treats the Centre and States as equal units by conferring a simultaneous power of enacting law on GST – Article 279A in constituting the GST Council envisions that neither the Centre nor the States can act independent of the other. Constitution of India – GST Law – Essential legislative functions – Excessive delegation of, if any – Constitution (One Hundred and First Amendment Act) 2016 – Central Goods and Services Tax, Act 2017 – Integrated Goods and Services Tax, Act 2017 – Whether the impugned notifications are ultra vires the IGST Act on the grounds of excessive delegation – Held: Legislature is required to perform its essential legislative functions – Once the skeletal structure of the policy is framed by the legislature, the details can emerge through delegated legislations – Legislature cannot delegate its ‘essential legislative functions – Essential legislative functions with respect to the GST law are the levy of tax, subject matter of tax, taxable person, rate of taxation and value for the purpose of taxation – Principles governing these essential aspects of taxation find place in the IGST Act – Both the IGST and CGST Act clearly define reverse charge, recipient and taxable persons – Thus, the essential legislative functions vis-à-vis reverse charge have not been delegated. Integrated Goods and Services Tax, Act 2017 – Central Goods and Services Tax, Act 2017 – ss. 2(30) and 8 – Impugned levy seeking to impose IGST on the ‘service’ aspect of the transaction, if in violation of the principle of ‘composite supply’ incorporated u/ s.2(30) r/w s.8 of the CGST Act – Held: Yes – Since the Indian importer is liable to pay IGST on the ‘composite supply’, comprising of supply of goods and supply of services of transportation, insurance, etc. in a CIF contract, a separate levy on the Indian importer for the ‘supply of services’ by the shipping line would be in violation of s.8 of the CGST Act – Double taxation. Central Goods and Services Tax, Act 2017 – s.2(93)(c) – Integrated Goods and Services Tax, Act 2017 – s.13(9) – Held: The only argument that supports the case of the appellant is that of s.13(9) of the IGST Act r/w s.2(93)(c) of the CGST Act which defines a “recipient” – s.13(9) of the IGST Act creates the deeming fiction of place of supply of service to be the destination of goods when they are transported by means other than mail or courier – No specific exemptions for importers have been carved out – This reasoning is accepted and read into the definition of recipient in s.2(93) of the CGST Act. Central Goods and Services Tax, Act 2017 – s.24(iii) – Integrated Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017 – ss.5(3), (4) – Held: Power of the Central Government to designate persons and categories of supply for reverse charge derives from ss.5(3) and 5(4) of the IGST Act and not s.24(iii) of the CGST Act which mandates the compulsorily registration as a logical corollary to ensure tax collection. Central Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017 – s.2(93) – Integrated Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017 – s.5(3) – Held: Interpreting the term “by the recipient” vis-à-vis the categories of goods and services identified in s.5(3) of the IGST Act should necessarily be governed by the principles governing the definition of “recipient” u/s.2(93) of the CGST Act. Interpretation of Statutes – Legislative history, Parliamentary debates, Committee Reports – Held: Though the traditional view of interpretation of statutes is that legislative history is not readily used in interpreting a law, the modern trend of thinking on the subject has enabled courts to look into the history of a legislation to understand the full purport of the words used and the mischief sought to be remedied by the law – Constitution of India – Articles 246A, 279A – Constitution (One Hundred and First Amendment Act) 2016 – Central Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017 – Integrated Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017. Words and Phrases: “Recommendations”– Constitution of India – Interpretation of, vis-à-vis the provisions of IGST Act and CGST Act – Integrated Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017 – Central Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017. ‘Cooperative federalism’; ‘Dual federalism’; ‘Fiscal federalism’ – Discussed",
