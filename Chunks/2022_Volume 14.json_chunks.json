        "HeadNote": "Constitution (One Hundred and Third Amendment) Act, 2019 – Challenge to – Vide said amendment, Arts. 15 and 16 of the Constitution were amended by adding two new clauses viz., clause (6) to Art.15 with Explanation and clause (6) to Art.16; and thereby, the State was empowered, inter alia, to provide for a maximum of ten per cent reservation for “the economically weaker sections” (EWS) of citizens other than “the Scheduled Castes”, “the Scheduled Tribes” and the non-creamy layer of “the Other Backward Classes” – The amendment did not mandate but enabled reservation for EWS and prescribed a ceiling limit of ten per cent – Challenge to said amendment essentially on three-fold grounds: first, that making of special provisions including reservation in education and employment on the basis of economic criteria is entirely impermissible and offends the basic structure of the Constitution; second, that in any case, exclusion of socially and educationally backward classes i.e., SCs, STs and non-creamy layer OBCs from the benefit of the special provisions for EWS is inexplicably discriminatory and destroys the basic structure of the Constitution; and third, that providing for ten per cent additional reservation directly breaches the fifty per cent ceiling of reservations already settled by decisions of Supreme Court and hence, results in unacceptable abrogation of the Equality Code which, again, destroys the basic structure of the Constitution – Constitution (One Hundred and Third Amendment) Act, 2019",

        "content": "Constitution (One Hundred and Third Amendment) Act, 2019 – Challenge to – Vide said amendment, Arts. 15 and 16 of the Constitution were amended by adding two new clauses viz., clause (6) to Art.15 with Explanation and clause (6) to Art.16; and thereby, the State was empowered, inter alia, to provide for a maximum of ten per cent reservation for “the economically weaker sections” (EWS) of citizens other than “the Scheduled Castes”, “the Scheduled Tribes” and the non-creamy layer of “the Other Backward Classes” – The amendment did not mandate but enabled reservation for EWS and prescribed a ceiling limit of ten per cent – Challenge to said amendment essentially on three-fold grounds: first, that making of special provisions including reservation in education and employment on the basis of economic criteria is entirely impermissible and offends the basic structure of the Constitution; second, that in any case, exclusion of socially and educationally backward classes i.e., SCs, STs and non-creamy layer OBCs from the benefit of the special provisions for EWS is inexplicably discriminatory and destroys the basic structure of the Constitution; and third, that providing for ten per cent additional reservation directly breaches the fifty per cent ceiling of reservations already settled by decisions of Supreme Court and hence, results in unacceptable abrogation of the Equality Code which, again, destroys the basic structure of the Constitution – Constitution (One Hundred and Third Amendment) Act, 2019"

Extra Judicial Confession – s.30 – Evidentiary value of – Extra judicial confession is a weak piece of evidence and the court must ensure that the same inspires confidence and is corroborated by other prosecution evidence – After subjecting the evidence of the witness to a rigorous test on the touchstone of credibility, the extra judicial confession can be accepted and can be the basis of a conviction if it passes the test of credibility – Where an extra judicial confession is surrounded by suspicious circumstances, its credibility becomes doubtful and it loses its importance like in the present case. Discovery Statement – s.27 – Mere discovery cannot be interpreted as sufficient to infer authorship of concealment by the person who discovered the weapon – He could have derived knowledge of the existence of that weapon at the place through some other source also – Therefore, it cannot be presumed or inferred that because a person discovered the weapon, he was the person who had concealed it, least it can be presumed that he used it. Motive – s.8 – Evidentiary value – The presence of motive in the facts and circumstances of the case creates a strong suspicion against the accused appellant but suspicion, howsoever strong, cannot be a substitute for proof of the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt. Circumstantial Evidence – The Court has to draw an inference with respect to whether the chain of circumstances is complete, and when the circumstances therein are collectively considered, the same must lead only to the irresistible conclusion that the accused alone is perpetrator of crime.",

Extra Judicial Confession – s.30 – Evidentiary value of – Extra judicial confession is a weak piece of evidence and the court must ensure that the same inspires confidence and is corroborated by other prosecution evidence – After subjecting the evidence of the witness to a rigorous test on the touchstone of credibility, the extra judicial confession can be accepted and can be the basis of a conviction if it passes the test of credibility – Where an extra judicial confession is surrounded by suspicious circumstances, its credibility becomes doubtful and it loses its importance like in the present case. Discovery Statement – s.27 – Mere discovery cannot be interpreted as sufficient to infer authorship of concealment by the person who discovered the weapon – He could have derived knowledge of the existence of that weapon at the place through some other source also – Therefore, it cannot be presumed or inferred that because a person discovered the weapon, he was the person who had concealed it, least it can be presumed that he used it. Motive – s.8 – Evidentiary value – The presence of motive in the facts and circumstances of the case creates a strong suspicion against the accused appellant but suspicion, howsoever strong, cannot be a substitute for proof of the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt. Circumstantial Evidence – The Court has to draw an inference with respect to whether the chain of circumstances is complete, and when the circumstances therein are collectively considered, the same must lead only to the irresistible conclusion that the accused alone is perpetrator of crime.",

Extra Judicial Confession – s.30 – Evidentiary value of – Extra judicial confession is a weak piece of evidence and the court must ensure that the same inspires confidence and is corroborated by other prosecution evidence – After subjecting the evidence of the witness to a rigorous test on the touchstone of credibility, the extra judicial confession can be accepted and can be the basis of a conviction if it passes the test of credibility – Where an extra judicial confession is surrounded by suspicious circumstances, its credibility becomes doubtful and it loses its importance like in the present case. Discovery Statement – s.27 – Mere discovery cannot be interpreted as sufficient to infer authorship of concealment by the person who discovered the weapon – He could have derived knowledge of the existence of that weapon at the place through some other source also – Therefore, it cannot be presumed or inferred that because a person discovered the weapon, he was the person who had concealed it, least it can be presumed that he used it. Motive – s.8 – Evidentiary value – The presence of motive in the facts and circumstances of the case creates a strong suspicion against the accused appellant but suspicion, howsoever strong, cannot be a substitute for proof of the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt. Circumstantial Evidence – The Court has to draw an inference with respect to whether the chain of circumstances is complete, and when the circumstances therein are collectively considered, the same must lead only to the irresistible conclusion that the accused alone is perpetrator of crime.",

XXI Rule 90(3) that no application to set aside a sale on grounds of irregularity or fraud under the Rule can be entertained on any ground which the applicant would have taken on or before the date on which the proclamation of sale was drawn up – The Explanation to the Rule further says that mere absence of or defect in attachment of the property sold should not by itself be a ground for setting aside the sale under this Rule – The Judgment Debtor/Respondent Trust failed to avail any of these opportunities at different stages – The dual test of material irregularity of fraud and substantial injury is not satisfied in the present case – Thus, auction sale is confirmed.",

BPL Sanyo Technologies Limited and 69,49,900 shares of M/s. BPL Sanyo Utilities and Appliances Limited to M/s. Celestial Finance Limited –Shares of M/s. BPL Sanyo Technologies Limited and M/s. BPL Sanyo Utilities and Appliances Limited, both public limited companies, were listed and quoted on the stock exchanges – However, these gifted shares being promoter quota shares were under a lock-in period up to 16th November 1993 and 25th May 1994 respectively – In the impugned judgment, the High Court observed that the equity shares under the lock-in period were not ‘quoted shares’ – A general circular issued by SEBI however stated that shares under the lock-in period can be transferred inter se the promoters – Issue whether such restricted transfer would convert the equity shares in the lock-in-period into ‘quoted shares’ as defined vide sub-rule (9) to r.2 of Part A of Schedule III of the W.T. Act – Answering in negative, the Court held: The restricted transfer would not make the equity shares in the lock-in period into “quoted shares” as the lock-in shares are not quoted in any recognised stock exchange with regularity from time to time and it is not possible to have quotations based upon current transactions made in the ordinary course of business – The shares in question being “unquoted shares” have to be valued in terms of r.11 of Part C of Schedule III of the W.T. Act as a standalone valuation method – This would be in accord with sub-section (1) to s.6 of the G.T. Act, which states that the value of a property, other than cash, transferred by way of gift, shall be valued on the date on which the gift was made and shall be determined in the manner as laid down in Schedule II of the G.T. Act, which makes the provisions of Schedule III of the W.T. Act applicable – Valuation cannot ignore the limitations attached to the shares – r.21 of Part H of Schedule III of the W.T. Act permits valuation and ascertainment of the market value as per provisions of Schedule III of the W.T. Act, but does not state that valuation will be done by disregarding the restrictions, or by enhancing the rights which have been transferred, or by revaluation of the asset when provisions of Schedule III are invoked for purpose of valuation of an asset under the W.T. Act. Shares and Securities – Wealth Tax Act,1957 – Explanation to r.2(9) of Part A, Schedule III – Effect of – Held: Explanation to r.2(9) of Part A, Schedule III of the W.T. Act does not prohibit the authority, tribunal or the court from examining whether a particular share, be it equity or preference share, is a “quoted share” or an “unquoted share” in terms of sub-rules (9) and (11) of r.2 of Part A of Schedule III of the W.T. Act – This right which is conferred on the authorities under the W.T. Act or the G.T. Act is not delegated to the stock exchange – A decision of the authority is however amenable and can be examined when challenged in an appeal – Gift Tax Act, 1958.",

Act to the respondent no. 1 – Respondent no.1 then filed suit for declaration against the appellant and the respondent no. 2 that the cheque which was dishonoured was handed over by him to respondent no.2 as a security and that appellant had not acquired any right over the said cheque as the respondent no.1 had no liability to discharge in favour of appellant – Appellant then filed an application u/Or. VII Rule 11seeking rejection of the plaint – Dismissed by trial court, however, the revisional court set aside the order of the trial court and rejected the plaint – In writ petition, the High Court set aside the order of the revisional court and remanded the matter holding that the revisional court had exceeded its jurisdiction in rejecting the plaint – On appeal, held : High Court was not right in holding that the revisional court had exceeded its jurisdiction and it could not have allowed the application filed under Order VII Rule 11 and thereby reversed the order of the trial court and finally disposed of the suit - High Court failed to appreciate the second proviso to s. 115 of CPC (Orissa amendment) in its true perspective - Revisional court, being the High Court or the District Court, as the case may be, can reverse an order which would finally dispose of the suit or other proceeding - Revisional court being the District Court, did the same. s.115 and Order VII Rule 11 - Specific Relief Act,1963 - ss.34,41 - Negotiable Instruments Act - ss. 118, 138 - Revisional court-District Court allowing the application filed u/ord. VII r 11 by the appellant and thereby rejecting the plaint filed by the respondent no.1 – Justification of – Appellant’s case that respondent no.2 has sought only declaratory that the cheque issued in the name of the appellant was a security and the appellant had no right to encash it and has not sought further or consequential reliefs, thus, suit is barred under Specific Relief Act; and that the suit filed by the respondent no.1 is an attempt to frustrate the possibility of the appellant initiating action under the provisions of the N.I. Act for the dishonour of cheque - Held : Omission on the part of the respondent no. 1 in praying for further consequential relief, would become relevant only at the time of final adjudication of the suit - Right of appellant to prosecute the respondent no. 1 owing to the dishonour of the cheque issued by the respondent no. 1 cannot be frustrated by seeking a declaration that the said cheque was handed over as a security – Such a declaration cannot be ex facie granted as it would be contrary to the provisions of the N.I. Act and particularly s.118(a) thereof – In these circumstances, while the respondent no. 1 has certain grievances arising from the MoU, against the appellants which may give rise to seek appropriate remedies in law, the declaratory reliefs sought in the plaint are barred by law - Hence, the plaint is liable to be rejected in exercise of jurisdiction u/Or.

Act to the respondent no. 1 – Respondent no.1 then filed suit for declaration against the appellant and the respondent no. 2 that the cheque which was dishonoured was handed over by him to respondent no.2 as a security and that appellant had not acquired any right over the said cheque as the respondent no.1 had no liability to discharge in favour of appellant – Appellant then filed an application u/Or. VII Rule 11seeking rejection of the plaint – Dismissed by trial court, however, the revisional court set aside the order of the trial court and rejected the plaint – In writ petition, the High Court set aside the order of the revisional court and remanded the matter holding that the revisional court had exceeded its jurisdiction in rejecting the plaint – On appeal, held : High Court was not right in holding that the revisional court had exceeded its jurisdiction and it could not have allowed the application filed under Order VII Rule 11 and thereby reversed the order of the trial court and finally disposed of the suit - High Court failed to appreciate the second proviso to s. 115 of CPC (Orissa amendment) in its true perspective - Revisional court, being the High Court or the District Court, as the case may be, can reverse an order which would finally dispose of the suit or other proceeding - Revisional court being the District Court, did the same. s.115 and Order VII Rule 11 - Specific Relief Act,1963 - ss.34,41 - Negotiable Instruments Act - ss. 118, 138 - Revisional court-District Court allowing the application filed u/ord. VII r 11 by the appellant and thereby rejecting the plaint filed by the respondent no.1 – Justification of – Appellant’s case that respondent no.2 has sought only declaratory that the cheque issued in the name of the appellant was a security and the appellant had no right to encash it and has not sought further or consequential reliefs, thus, suit is barred under Specific Relief Act; and that the suit filed by the respondent no.1 is an attempt to frustrate the possibility of the appellant initiating action under the provisions of the N.I. Act for the dishonour of cheque - Held : Omission on the part of the respondent no. 1 in praying for further consequential relief, would become relevant only at the time of final adjudication of the suit - Right of appellant to prosecute the respondent no. 1 owing to the dishonour of the cheque issued by the respondent no. 1 cannot be frustrated by seeking a declaration that the said cheque was handed over as a security – Such a declaration cannot be ex facie granted as it would be contrary to the provisions of the N.I. Act and particularly s.118(a) thereof – In these circumstances, while the respondent no. 1 has certain grievances arising from the MoU, against the appellants which may give rise to seek appropriate remedies in law, the declaratory reliefs sought in the plaint are barred by law - Hence, the plaint is liable to be rejected in exercise of jurisdiction u/Or. VII r. 11 CPC. Order VII Rule 11 - Rejection of Plaint - Purpose/Object - Discussed",

Act to the respondent no. 1 – Respondent no.1 then filed suit for declaration against the appellant and the respondent no. 2 that the cheque which was dishonoured was handed over by him to respondent no.2 as a security and that appellant had not acquired any right over the said cheque as the respondent no.1 had no liability to discharge in favour of appellant – Appellant then filed an application u/Or. VII Rule 11seeking rejection of the plaint – Dismissed by trial court, however, the revisional court set aside the order of the trial court and rejected the plaint – In writ petition, the High Court set aside the order of the revisional court and remanded the matter holding that the revisional court had exceeded its jurisdiction in rejecting the plaint – On appeal, held : High Court was not right in holding that the revisional court had exceeded its jurisdiction and it could not have allowed the application filed under Order VII Rule 11 and thereby reversed the order of the trial court and finally disposed of the suit - High Court failed to appreciate the second proviso to s. 115 of CPC (Orissa amendment) in its true perspective - Revisional court, being the High Court or the District Court, as the case may be, can reverse an order which would finally dispose of the suit or other proceeding - Revisional court being the District Court, did the same. s.115 and Order VII Rule 11 - Specific Relief Act,1963 - ss.34,41 - Negotiable Instruments Act - ss. 118, 138 - Revisional court-District Court allowing the application filed u/ord. VII r 11 by the appellant and thereby rejecting the plaint filed by the respondent no.1 – Justification of – Appellant’s case that respondent no.2 has sought only declaratory that the cheque issued in the name of the appellant was a security and the appellant had no right to encash it and has not sought further or consequential reliefs, thus, suit is barred under Specific Relief Act; and that the suit filed by the respondent no.1 is an attempt to frustrate the possibility of the appellant initiating action under the provisions of the N.I. Act for the dishonour of cheque - Held : Omission on the part of the respondent no. 1 in praying for further consequential relief, would become relevant only at the time of final adjudication of the suit - Right of appellant to prosecute the respondent no. 1 owing to the dishonour of the cheque issued by the respondent no. 1 cannot be frustrated by seeking a declaration that the said cheque was handed over as a security – Such a declaration cannot be ex facie granted as it would be contrary to the provisions of the N.I. Act and particularly s.118(a) thereof – In these circumstances, while the respondent no. 1 has certain grievances arising from the MoU, against the appellants which may give rise to seek appropriate remedies in law, the declaratory reliefs sought in the plaint are barred by law - Hence, the plaint is liable to be rejected in exercise of jurisdiction u/Or. VII r. 11 CPC. Order VII Rule 11 - Rejection of Plaint - Purpose/Object - Discussed",

Act to the respondent no. 1 – Respondent no.1 then filed suit for declaration against the appellant and the respondent no. 2 that the cheque which was dishonoured was handed over by him to respondent no.2 as a security and that appellant had not acquired any right over the said cheque as the respondent no.1 had no liability to discharge in favour of appellant – Appellant then filed an application u/Or. VII Rule 11seeking rejection of the plaint – Dismissed by trial court, however, the revisional court set aside the order of the trial court and rejected the plaint – In writ petition, the High Court set aside the order of the revisional court and remanded the matter holding that the revisional court had exceeded its jurisdiction in rejecting the plaint – On appeal, held : High Court was not right in holding that the revisional court had exceeded its jurisdiction and it could not have allowed the application filed under Order VII Rule 11 and thereby reversed the order of the trial court and finally disposed of the suit - High Court failed to appreciate the second proviso to s. 115 of CPC (Orissa amendment) in its true perspective - Revisional court, being the High Court or the District Court, as the case may be, can reverse an order which would finally dispose of the suit or other proceeding - Revisional court being the District Court, did the same. s.115 and Order VII Rule 11 - Specific Relief Act,1963 - ss.34,41 - Negotiable Instruments Act - ss. 118, 138 - Revisional court-District Court allowing the application filed u/ord. VII r 11 by the appellant and thereby rejecting the plaint filed by the respondent no.1 – Justification of – Appellant’s case that respondent no.2 has sought only declaratory that the cheque issued in the name of the appellant was a security and the appellant had no right to encash it and has not sought further or consequential reliefs, thus, suit is barred under Specific Relief Act; and that the suit filed by the respondent no.1 is an attempt to frustrate the possibility of the appellant initiating action under the provisions of the N.I. Act for the dishonour of cheque - Held : Omission on the part of the respondent no. 1 in praying for further consequential relief, would become relevant only at the time of final adjudication of the suit - Right of appellant to prosecute the respondent no. 1 owing to the dishonour of the cheque issued by the respondent no. 1 cannot be frustrated by seeking a declaration that the said cheque was handed over as a security – Such a declaration cannot be ex facie granted as it would be contrary to the provisions of the N.I. Act and particularly s.118(a) thereof – In these circumstances, while the respondent no. 1 has certain grievances arising from the MoU, against the appellants which may give rise to seek appropriate remedies in law, the declaratory reliefs sought in the plaint are barred by law - Hence, the plaint is liable to be rejected in exercise of jurisdiction u/Or.

Acquisition of land, in absence of environmental clearance – Permissibility of – Plea that two companies did not have any Environmental Clearance, in the absence of which the land could not have been acquired for setting up the plant – Held : No objection can be raised that there is no environmental clearance certificate from the Ministry of Environment and Forest as the same has already been issued on 23.09.2016. Land acquisition, if vitiated for non-application of mind and undue haste by competent authorities – Held : No grounds were raised nor any foundation laid in the petitions alleging mala fide – Object of the 2002 Act was primarily to provide a Single Window Clearance by the High Level Committees constituted under the 2002 Act – Reports and recommendations of the different Committees as also the State Government have been gone through – Found that all aspects of the matter have been considered and a conscious decision has been taken on the overall conspectus of the project and the proposals submitted. s. 3(1), 1(3), 28(1) – Procedure prescribed to acquire land under – Duly followed or not – Held: Entire process as provided under the Act has been strictly followed – Division Bench in the impugned judgment apparently was swayed by its own personal views based on assumptions and having no material backing which led to the quashing of the notifications. ss. 28, 41 – Allotment of plots in special cases – Land Acquisition for single company, if can be said to be for public purpose and could be made under 1966 Act – Held : Under the Regulation 13, the Board is empowered to allot any plot or area to any individual or company for establishment of an industry in consultation with the State Government – This provision also contemplates acquiring land for the purpose of allotment to a single company to set up an industry – In the instant case, the allotment by the Board is duly approved by the State Government. Land acquisition for a non–applicant company under the Act, without its application being routed through State High Level Clearance Committee – Permissibility of – Held : Non–applicant company is fully owned subsidiary of the applicant company – Only change sought by the applicant was the integrated steel plant be set up by non-applicant which was its own subsidiary – These are commercial matters and the State after examining the proposal for change in its wisdom accepted the same – There was no change in the project, as such, regarding the finance, employment and other infrastructures – Thus, the said objection not maintainable. Reliance on Shri Ramtanu Coop. Housing Society Ltd. vs. State of Maharashtra’s case for the proposition that the acquisition under the 1966 Act was in pari materia to the Maharashtra Industrial Development Act, 1962 and, thus, the acquisition has to be for public purpose only and not for a private company – Correctness of – Held : Validity of the 1962 Act was being considered in the case of Shri Ramtanu – However, in the present litigation, there is no challenge to the validity of the 1966 Act or the 2002 Act – Purpose in 1962 Act was for establishment of industrial areas whereas in the other statute i.e 1966 Act, it was for promotion of the establishment and orderly development of industries – Thus, the reliance by the Division Bench in the impugned judgment on the case of Shri Ramtanu is misplaced – Maharashtra Industrial Development Act, 1962. Value judgments of policy views – Significance of – Conclusions arrived at in the impugned judgment, if vitiated on account of inclusion of value judgments of policy views by the High Court – Held : Division Bench introduced several value judgments and policy views in order to interpret the provisions of the 1966 Act and the 2002 Act – Such value judgments and policy views are beyond the domain of the Court – Courts should refrain itself from expressing value judgments and policy views in order to interpret statutes – Statutes are to be read in their plain language and not otherwise – Interpretation of Statutes. Petition for quashing the land acquisition by a fraction of landowners holding a fraction of acquired land which is only 10 % or less of the total acquired land – Maintainability of – Held : Quashing the entire acquisition at the instance of one land owner having 4.34 acres of land out of total acquisition for applicant company of 110 acres, would be against the public policy and public interest – Further, in the case of non-applicant company acquisition of 914 acres is challenged by a fraction of less than 10% land owners – Hence, Division Bench erred in quashing the acquisition proceedings.

        "HeadNote": "Land Acquisition : Karnataka Industrial Areas Development Act, 1966: ss. 3(1), 1(3) and 28(1) – Land acquisition by the Karnataka Industrial Area Development Board for two companies, the appellant company and its fully owned subsidiary for setting up an iron ore plant – Issuance of Notification u/ss. 1(3), 3(1) and 28(1) of the 1966 Act for land acquisition – Objections invited from land owners u/s. 28(3) of 1966 Act – Objections duly considered – Thereafter, notifications u/s. 28(4) of 1966 Act was issued for a total area required by the appellant company – Similar notifications were issued for the land required for the subsidiary company – Compensation also determined – Writ Petitions filed seeking quashing of the notifications issued u/s. 28(4) of the 1966 Act for the appellant company and its fully owned subsidiary – More than 90 per cent of the land owners covering 90 per cent of the area acquired accepted the compensation – Only 10 per cent or less of the land owners had filed the said writ petitions – Challenge was also made to the grant u/ss. 1(3) and 3(1) of the 1966 Act – Single Judge dismissed all the petitions filed by land owners – However, the Division Bench quashed the acquisition proceedings for the entire areas which was not even challenged – Also quashed the notifications issued u/ss. 1(3), 3(1) and 28(1) of the 1966 Act – On appeal, held – Division Bench erred in quashing the acquisition proceeding – Karnataka Industries (Facilitation) Act, 2002. Acquisition of land, in absence of environmental clearance – Permissibility of – Plea that two companies did not have any Environmental Clearance, in the absence of which the land could not have been acquired for setting up the plant – Held : No objection can be raised that there is no environmental clearance certificate from the Ministry of Environment and Forest as the same has already been issued on 23.09.2016. Land acquisition, if vitiated for non-application of mind and undue haste by competent authorities – Held : No grounds were raised nor any foundation laid in the petitions alleging mala fide – Object of the 2002 Act was primarily to provide a Single Window Clearance by the High Level Committees constituted under the 2002 Act – Reports and recommendations of the different Committees as also the State Government have been gone through – Found that all aspects of the matter have been considered and a conscious decision has been taken on the overall conspectus of the project and the proposals submitted. s. 3(1), 1(3), 28(1) – Procedure prescribed to acquire land under – Duly followed or not – Held: Entire process as provided under the Act has been strictly followed – Division Bench in the impugned judgment apparently was swayed by its own personal views based on assumptions and having no material backing which led to the quashing of the notifications. ss. 28, 41 – Allotment of plots in special cases – Land Acquisition for single company, if can be said to be for public purpose and could be made under 1966 Act – Held : Under the Regulation 13, the Board is empowered to allot any plot or area to any individual or company for establishment of an industry in consultation with the State Government – This provision also contemplates acquiring land for the purpose of allotment to a single company to set up an industry – In the instant case, the allotment by the Board is duly approved by the State Government. Land acquisition for a non–applicant company under the Act, without its application being routed through State High Level Clearance Committee – Permissibility of – Held : Non–applicant company is fully owned subsidiary of the applicant company – Only change sought by the applicant was the integrated steel plant be set up by non-applicant which was its own subsidiary – These are commercial matters and the State after examining the proposal for change in its wisdom accepted the same – There was no change in the project, as such, regarding the finance, employment and other infrastructures – Thus, the said objection not maintainable. Reliance on Shri Ramtanu Coop. Housing Society Ltd. vs. State of Maharashtra’s case for the proposition that the acquisition under the 1966 Act was in pari materia to the Maharashtra Industrial Development Act, 1962 and, thus, the acquisition has to be for public purpose only and not for a private company – Correctness of – Held : Validity of the 1962 Act was being considered in the case of Shri Ramtanu – However, in the present litigation, there is no challenge to the validity of the 1966 Act or the 2002 Act – Purpose in 1962 Act was for establishment of industrial areas whereas in the other statute i.e 1966 Act, it was for promotion of the establishment and orderly development of industries – Thus, the reliance by the Division Bench in the impugned judgment on the case of Shri Ramtanu is misplaced – Maharashtra Industrial Development Act, 1962. Value judgments of policy views – Significance of – Conclusions arrived at in the impugned judgment, if vitiated on account of inclusion of value judgments of policy views by the High Court – Held : Division Bench introduced several value judgments and policy views in order to interpret the provisions of the 1966 Act and the 2002 Act – Such value judgments and policy views are beyond the domain of the Court – Courts should refrain itself from expressing value judgments and policy views in order to interpret statutes – Statutes are to be read in their plain language and not otherwise – Interpretation of Statutes. Petition for quashing the land acquisition by a fraction of landowners holding a fraction of acquired land which is only 10 % or less of the total acquired land – Maintainability of – Held : Quashing the entire acquisition at the instance of one land owner having 4.34 acres of land out of total acquisition for applicant company of 110 acres, would be against the public policy and public interest – Further, in the case of non-applicant company acquisition of 914 acres is challenged by a fraction of less than 10% land owners – Hence, Division Bench erred in quashing the acquisition proceedings.
