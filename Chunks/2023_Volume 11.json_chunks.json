Articles 72, 161,Constitution of India:Held: Sentencing is a judicial exercise of power – The act thereafterof executing the sentence awarded, however, is a purely executive functionwhich includes the grant of remission, commutation, pardon, reprieves, orsuspension of sentence – This executive power is traceable to Article 72and 161 of the Constitution of India – Whilst the statutory (u/s.432 CrPC)and constitutional (under Articles 72 and 161 of the Constitution) powersare distinct- the former limited power, is still an imprint of the latter (muchwider power), and must be understood as such and placed in this context –This executive power which is inherently discretionary in nature, has to beexercised fairly, reasonably, and not arbitrarily – Absence to do so, wouldcompel the court to exercise its judicial review and in appropriate casesremit the matter for reconsideration – Procedure laid out in s.432(2), hasbeen held to be mandatory.[Paras 9 and 10]Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 – Remission – Parameters tobe considered – Discussed.[Para 11]Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 – Remission – Role of presidingjudge’s view – Weightage to be attached:Held: The discretion that the executive is empowered with in executinga sentence, would be denuded of its content, if the presiding judge’s viewwhichis formed in all likelihood, largely (if not solely) on the basis of thejudicial record- is mechanically followed by the concerned authority – Suchan approach has the potential to strike at the heart, and subvert the conceptof remission- as a reward and incentive encouraging actions and behaviourgeared towards reformation- in a modern legal system – If the presidingjudge’s report is only refl ective of the facts and circumstances that led tothe conclusion of the convict’s guilt, and is merely a reiteration of thosecircumstances available to the judge at the time of sentencing (some 14 ormore years earlier, as the case may be), then the appropriate governmentshould attach weight to this fi nding, accordingly – Such a report, cannot be relied on as carrying predominance, if it focusses on the crime, with littleor no attention to the criminal.[Paras 16 and 17]Sentencing – Heinous crimes:Held: Even at the stage of sentencing, the judge ideally is to exercisediscretion after looking at a wide range of factors relating to the criminaland not just the crime; but as noticed in numerous precedents that have dealtwith sentencing in the commission of heinous crimes, this is unfortunately,often not the reality – Guidance has been off ered by this court on how tomitigate this in recent years, but it is pragmatic to acknowledge that it willrequire time for our criminal justice system to incorporate, and uniformlyreach such standards.Sentencing – Imprisonment – Aim and goal of – Discussed.[Para19]Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 – Remission – Report submittedby the SP in the second round was adverse – Duty of the appropriategovernment:Held: Report submitted by the Superintendent of Police in the secondround (was diametrically diff erent from that which was submitted in thefi rst round), was adverse – In each case, the appropriate government hasto be cognizant of the latent (not always) prejudices of the crime, that thepolice as well as the investigating agency, may be citing- especially in acase such as the present one, where the slain victims were police personnelthemselves, i.e., members of the police force – These biases may informthe report, and cannot be given determinative value – Apart from the otherconsiderations (on the nature of the crime, whether it aff ected the societyat large, the chance of its recurrence, etc.), the appropriate governmentshould while considering the potential of the convict to commit crimesin the future, whether there remains any fruitful purpose of continuedincarceration, and the socio-economic conditions, review: the convict’s age,state of heath, familial relationships and possibility of reintegration, extentof earned remission, and the post-conviction conduct including, but notlimited to- whether the convict has attained any educational qualifi cationwhilst in custody, volunteer services off ered, job/work done, jail conduct,whether they were engaged in any socially aimed or productive activity, andthe overall development as a human being – The Board should not entirelyrely either on the presiding judge, or the report prepared by the police – It would also serve the ends of justice if the appropriate government had thebenefi t of a report contemporaneously prepared by a qualifi ed psychologistafter interacting/interviewing the convict that has applied for prematurerelease. [Paras 20 and 21]Adminstration of Criminal Justice – Sentencing – Balancingsocietal interests with the rights of the convict:Held: The majority view and the minority view in Sriharan underlinedthe need to balance societal interests with the rights of the convict (that ina given case, the sentence should not be unduly harsh, or excessive) – Thecourt acknowledged that it lies within the executive’s domain to grant, orrefuse premature release; however, such power would be guided, and thediscretion informed by reason, stemming from appropriate rules.[Para 22]Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 – Remission – Diff erent policieson the date of conviction and on the date of consideration for prematurerelease:Held: This court had grappled with the situation of diff erent remissionpolicies/rules prevailing at diff erent points of the convict’s sentence- i.e.,when the policy on the date of conviction, and on the date of consideration forpremature release, are diff erent – It has been held that the policy prevailingon the date of the conviction20 , would be applicable – However, in Jagdishit was also recognised that if a more liberal policy exists on the date ofconsideration, the benefi t should be provided – In the present case, on the dateof conviction (24.05.2001), it is the pre-2002 policy that was applicable – Inthe old pre-2002 policy, there is no mention of any ineligibility criteria, muchless one that is analogous to Rule 529(iv)(b) of the 2002 policy, which wascited by the Remission Board in its rejection of the petitioner’s applicationon 20.04.2023.

[Para 13]Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 – s.34 – Jurisdiction under:Held : The limited and extremely circumscribed jurisdiction of thecourt u/s. 34 of the Act, permits the court to interfere with an award, sansthe grounds of patent illegality, i.e., that “illegality must go to the root of thematter and cannot be of a trivial nature”; and that the tribunal “must decidein accordance with the terms of the contract, but if an arbitrator construesa term of the contract in a reasonable manner, it will not mean that the award can be set aside on this ground”– The other ground would be denialof natural justice. [Para 15]Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 – s.37 – Scope of AppellateCourt to review fi ndings:Held : In appeal, s.37 of the Act grants narrower scope to the appellatecourt to review the fi ndings in an award, if it has been upheld, or substantiallyupheld u/s. 34 – It is important to notice that the old Act contained a provisionwhich enabled the court to modify an award – However, that power hasbeen consciously omitted by Parliament, while enacting the Act of 1996 –This means that the Parliamentary intent was to exclude power to modifyan award, in any manner, to the court.

[Paras 20 and 24] Maharashtra Co-operative Societies Act, 1960 – s.81(5B) – FIRregistered by appellant-share holder against respondents for off encespunishable u/ss.420, 406, 409, 465, 467, 468 and 471 r/w. s.34 of IPC– FIR quashed by High Court relying on s.81(5B) of the 1960 Act –Propriety of:Held: The High Court held that s.81(5B) contains special provisions forthe submission of a special report and the obtaining of the permission of theRegistrar before the lodging of an FIR – It held that these provisions would berendered otiose if the general provisions in the Code of Criminal Procedure 1973were to apply – In the instant circumstances, the High Court has erred in quashingthe FIR which was lodged by the appellant – S.81(5B) cannot be interpreted tomean that any other person who comes to know about the fi nancial irregularityon the basis of the audit report is debarred from reporting the irregularity to thepolice – It is correct that the FIR adverted to the audit which was conducted inrespect of the aff airs of the co-operative society – However, once the criminallaw is set into motion, it is the duty of the police to investigate into the allegedoff ence – This process cannot be interdicted by relying upon the provisions ofsub-section (5B) of s. 81 which cast a duty on the Registrar/auditor to lodge afi rst information report – Impugned Judgment and order of the High Court setaside.

XXI rr 97 to 101 – Executionof judgment and orders – Executing Court holding an execution decreeas inexecutable, on the ground that the decree-holder lost possession toan encroacher – Correctness of:Held: Executing Court could not have dismissed the execution petitionby treating the decree to be inexecutable merely on the basis that the decreeholderlost possession to a third party/encroacher – If this is allowed, everyjudgment-debtor in possession of the immoveable property till the decreeis passed, would hand over possession to a third party to defeat the decreeholder’sright and entitlement and this would continue indefi nitely and nodecree for immovable property can be executed – It was the duty of theExecuting Court to issue warrant of possession for eff ecting physical deliveryof the suit land to the decree-holder in terms of suit schedule property andif any resistance was off ered by any stranger to the decree, the same beadjudicated upon in accordance with rr. 97 to 101 of Ord. XXI – On facts, no resistance off ered by any purported stranger/encroacher to the decree –In the absence thereof, the Executing Court had no occasion to invoke Ord.XXI, rr 97 to 101, at the instance of the decree-holder – Executing Courtcould not have closed the execution proceedings holding that the decree isinexecutable – Thus, the orders passed by the High Court and the ExecutingCourt set aside – Issuance of direction to the Executing Court to executethe decree by eff ecting delivery of physical vacant possession to the decreeholder.[Paras 10, 15 and 16]",

[Paras 22-25]Service Law – Disciplinary proceedings – Scope of judicial review:Held: Scope of judicial review against a departmental enquiryproceeding is very limited – It is not in the nature of an appeal and a reviewon merits of the decision is not permissible – Scope of the enquiry is toexamine whether the decision-making process is legitimate and to ensurethat the fi ndings are not bereft of any evidence – If the records reveal that thefi ndings are based on some evidence, it is not the function of the court in ajudicial review to re-appreciate the same and arrive at an independent fi ndingon the evidence – On facts, it could not be said that the Enquiry Report,the fi ndings of the Disciplinary Authority and the order of the AppointingAuthority are based on no evidence or are perverse – Even if the reportinsofar as the aspect of non-submission of control form, the transgressionof the area of operation and non-declaration of the immovable property andcertain other charges is avoided, the order of penalty can be sustained –Aspects of failure to conduct periodic inspection and the negligence in notstipulating the taking of immovable property as collateral security in spiteof the party off ering it, constrains to conclude that there was material onrecord for the appellant to pass the order of penalty – Orders of the Single Judge and the Division Bench not sustainable for transgressing the limits ofjudicial review in setting aside the enquiry proceedings and the punishmentimposed. [Paras 32, 33, 36 and 37]Service Law – Penalty – Severability of charges – Interferencewith the order of penalty:Held: If in a disciplinary proceeding, the order of penalty can beimposed on the charges proved and the punishment imposed is lawfullysustainable on those charges, it is not for the Court to consider whetherthose grounds alone would have weighed with the authority in imposingthe punishment – Unless punishment imposed is only co-relatable to anyof those charges found not proved, the penalty cannot be set aside – Onfacts, the punishment can be sustained even if the charges held not provedare severed – Test is not of loss having being resulted or profi t havingbeen made, the test is whether the delinquent employee, has observed theprescribed norms of the Bank – Penalty imposed is “reduction in basic payto the lowest stage in Scale-I” and further, to treat the period spent by thedelinquent offi cer as under suspension – Since the charge of not conductingperiodical inspection and the failure to complete the formalities for creatingequitable mortgage are supported by evidence, the penalty as imposed isnot disproportionate so as to shock the conscience of the Court – Penaltyas imposed by the Appointing Authority and as confi rmed by the AppellateAuthority maintained.

        "HeadNote": "Issue for consideration: Rule 2(c)(iii) of the Kerala State HigherJudicial Services Special Rules 1961 stipulates that 25% of the posts in thecategory shall be fi lled by direct recruitment from the Bar “on the basis ofaggregate marks/grade obtained in a competitive examination and viva-voceconducted by the High Court”. The scheme of examination specifi callystipulated that there shall be no cut off marks for the viva voce. Whetherthe decision of the High Court to prescribe a cut-off for the viva-voceexamination was arbitrary.Kerala State Higher Judicial Services Special Rules 1961 – rule 2(c)(iii) – The scheme which was notifi ed by the High Court on 13.12.2012clearly specifi ed that there would be no cut off marks in respect of theviva-voce – However, the decision of the High Court to prescribe a cutofffor the viva-voce examination was taken much after the viva-vocetests were conducted – Propriety:Held: The Administrative Committee of the High Court decided toimpose a cut off for the viva-voce examination actuated by the bona fi dereason of ensuring that candidates with requisite personality assume judicialoffi ce – Such a change would be required to be brought in by a substantiveamendment to the Rules which came in much later – This is not a casewhere the rules or the scheme of the High Court were silent – Where thestatutory rules are silent, they can be supplemented in a manner consistent with the object and spirit of the Rules by an administrative order – In thepresent case, the statutory rules expressly provided that the select list wouldbe drawn up on the basis of the aggregate of marks obtained in the writtenexamination and the viva-voce – This was further elaborated in the schemeof examination which prescribed that there would be no cut off marks forthe viva-voce – This position is also refl ected in the notifi cation of the HighCourt dated 30.09.2015 – In this backdrop, the decision of the High Courtsuff ered from its being ultra vires the 1961 Rules besides being manifestlyarbitrary. [Paras 15 and 16]Doctrines – Doctrine of legitimate expectation – Claim under:Held: An individual who claims a benefi t or entitlement based on thedoctrine of legitimate expectation has to establish: (i) the legitimacy of theexpectation; and (ii) that the denial of the legitimate expectation led to theviolation of Article 14. [Para 44]Doctrines – Doctrine of legitimate expectation – Whether the HighCourt’s decision frustrates the legitimate expectation of the petitioners:Held: Rule 2(c)(iii) of the 1961 Rules provided at the material time that25% of the posts of District and Sessions Judges should be fi lled by directrecruitment from the Bar on the basis of aggregate marks/grade obtained inthe written examination and the viva-voce conducted by the High Court – Thescheme of examination specifi cally stipulates that there shall be no cut offmarks for the viva voce – The petitioners would have expected no minimumcut-off for the viva voce in view of the express stipulation in the scheme ofexamination – Both the above expectations of the petitioners are legitimateas they are based on the sanction of statutory rules, scheme of examination– The decision of the Administrative Committee to depart from the expectedcourse of preparing the merit list of the selected candidates is contrary to theunamended 1961 Rules – In the instant case, the requirement of a minimumcut-off for the viva-voce was introduced after the viva voce was conducted –The petitioners had no notice that such a requirement would be introduced forthe viva voce examination – The High Court’s decision to apply a minimumcut-off for the viva voce frustrated the substantive legitimate expectation ofthe petitioners – Since, the decision of the High Court is legally untenable andfails on the touchstone of fairness, consistency, and predictability, such a courseof action is arbitrary and violative of Article 14. [Paras 46, 47, 51 and 52] Principles – Principles of good administration:Held: The principles of good administration require that the decisionsof public authorities must withstand the test of consistency, transparency,and predictability to avoid being termed as arbitrary and violative of Article14. [Para 55]Doctrines – Doctrine of legitimate expectation – Limitation inapplication of:Held: A public authority must objectively demonstrate by placingrelevant material before the court that its decision was in the public interestto frustrate a claim of legitimate expectation. [Para 55]Directions – The High Court’s decision to apply a minimum cutofffor the viva voce frustrated the substantive legitimate expectationof the petitioners – The decision of the High Court is legally untenable– Whether the petitioners can be inducted into the Higher JudicialService:Held: In terms of relief, it would be contrary to the public interest todirect the induction of the petitioners into the Higher Judicial Service afterthe lapse of more than six years – Candidates who were selected nearly sixyears ago cannot be unseated – They were all qualifi ed and have been servingthe district judiciary of the state – Unseating them at this stage would becontrary to public interest – To induct the petitioners would be to bring innew candidates in preference to those who are holding judicial offi ce for alength of time – To deprive the State and its citizens of the benefi t of theseexperienced judicial offi cers at a senior position would not be in publicinterest.

The scheme of examination specifi callystipulated that there shall be no cut off marks for the viva voce. Whetherthe decision of the High Court to prescribe a cut-off for the viva-voceexamination was arbitrary.Kerala State Higher Judicial Services Special Rules 1961 – rule 2(c)(iii) – The scheme which was notifi ed by the High Court on 13.12.2012clearly specifi ed that there would be no cut off marks in respect of theviva-voce – However, the decision of the High Court to prescribe a cutofffor the viva-voce examination was taken much after the viva-vocetests were conducted – Propriety:Held: The Administrative Committee of the High Court decided toimpose a cut off for the viva-voce examination actuated by the bona fi dereason of ensuring that candidates with requisite personality assume judicialoffi ce – Such a change would be required to be brought in by a substantiveamendment to the Rules which came in much later – This is not a casewhere the rules or the scheme of the High Court were silent – Where thestatutory rules are silent, they can be supplemented in a manner consistent with the object and spirit of the Rules by an administrative order – In thepresent case, the statutory rules expressly provided that the select list wouldbe drawn up on the basis of the aggregate of marks obtained in the writtenexamination and the viva-voce – This was further elaborated in the schemeof examination which prescribed that there would be no cut off marks forthe viva-voce – This position is also refl ected in the notifi cation of the HighCourt dated 30.09.2015 – In this backdrop, the decision of the High Courtsuff ered from its being ultra vires the 1961 Rules besides being manifestlyarbitrary. [Paras 15 and 16]Doctrines – Doctrine of legitimate expectation – Claim under:Held: An individual who claims a benefi t or entitlement based on thedoctrine of legitimate expectation has to establish: (i) the legitimacy of theexpectation; and (ii) that the denial of the legitimate expectation led to theviolation of Article 14. [Para 44]Doctrines – Doctrine of legitimate expectation – Whether the HighCourt’s decision frustrates the legitimate expectation of the petitioners:Held: Rule 2(c)(iii) of the 1961 Rules provided at the material time that25% of the posts of District and Sessions Judges should be fi lled by directrecruitment from the Bar on the basis of aggregate marks/grade obtained inthe written examination and the viva-voce conducted by the High Court – Thescheme of examination specifi cally stipulates that there shall be no cut offmarks for the viva voce – The petitioners would have expected no minimumcut-off for the viva voce in view of the express stipulation in the scheme ofexamination – Both the above expectations of the petitioners are legitimateas they are based on the sanction of statutory rules, scheme of examination– The decision of the Administrative Committee to depart from the expectedcourse of preparing the merit list of the selected candidates is contrary to theunamended 1961 Rules – In the instant case, the requirement of a minimumcut-off for the viva-voce was introduced after the viva voce was conducted –The petitioners had no notice that such a requirement would be introduced forthe viva voce examination – The High Court’s decision to apply a minimumcut-off for the viva voce frustrated the substantive legitimate expectation ofthe petitioners – Since, the decision of the High Court is legally untenable andfails on the touchstone of fairness, consistency, and predictability, such a courseof action is arbitrary and violative of Article 14. [Paras 46, 47, 51 and 52] Principles – Principles of good administration:Held: The principles of good administration require that the decisionsof public authorities must withstand the test of consistency, transparency,and predictability to avoid being termed as arbitrary and violative of Article14. [Para 55]Doctrines – Doctrine of legitimate expectation – Limitation inapplication of:Held: A public authority must objectively demonstrate by placingrelevant material before the court that its decision was in the public interestto frustrate a claim of legitimate expectation. [Para 55]Directions – The High Court’s decision to apply a minimum cutofffor the viva voce frustrated the substantive legitimate expectationof the petitioners – The decision of the High Court is legally untenable– Whether the petitioners can be inducted into the Higher JudicialService:Held: In terms of relief, it would be contrary to the public interest todirect the induction of the petitioners into the Higher Judicial Service afterthe lapse of more than six years – Candidates who were selected nearly sixyears ago cannot be unseated – They were all qualifi ed and have been servingthe district judiciary of the state – Unseating them at this stage would becontrary to public interest – To induct the petitioners would be to bring innew candidates in preference to those who are holding judicial offi ce for alength of time – To deprive the State and its citizens of the benefi t of theseexperienced judicial offi cers at a senior position would not be in publicinterest.

        "HeadNote": "Issue for consideration: Rule 2(c)(iii) of the Kerala State HigherJudicial Services Special Rules 1961 stipulates that 25% of the posts in thecategory shall be fi lled by direct recruitment from the Bar “on the basis ofaggregate marks/grade obtained in a competitive examination and viva-voceconducted by the High Court”. The scheme of examination specifi callystipulated that there shall be no cut off marks for the viva voce. Whetherthe decision of the High Court to prescribe a cut-off for the viva-voceexamination was arbitrary.Kerala State Higher Judicial Services Special Rules 1961 – rule 2(c)(iii) – The scheme which was notifi ed by the High Court on 13.12.2012clearly specifi ed that there would be no cut off marks in respect of theviva-voce – However, the decision of the High Court to prescribe a cutofffor the viva-voce examination was taken much after the viva-vocetests were conducted – Propriety:Held: The Administrative Committee of the High Court decided toimpose a cut off for the viva-voce examination actuated by the bona fi dereason of ensuring that candidates with requisite personality assume judicialoffi ce – Such a change would be required to be brought in by a substantiveamendment to the Rules which came in much later – This is not a casewhere the rules or the scheme of the High Court were silent – Where thestatutory rules are silent, they can be supplemented in a manner consistent with the object and spirit of the Rules by an administrative order – In thepresent case, the statutory rules expressly provided that the select list wouldbe drawn up on the basis of the aggregate of marks obtained in the writtenexamination and the viva-voce – This was further elaborated in the schemeof examination which prescribed that there would be no cut off marks forthe viva-voce – This position is also refl ected in the notifi cation of the HighCourt dated 30.09.2015 – In this backdrop, the decision of the High Courtsuff ered from its being ultra vires the 1961 Rules besides being manifestlyarbitrary. [Paras 15 and 16]Doctrines – Doctrine of legitimate expectation – Claim under:Held: An individual who claims a benefi t or entitlement based on thedoctrine of legitimate expectation has to establish: (i) the legitimacy of theexpectation; and (ii) that the denial of the legitimate expectation led to theviolation of Article 14. [Para 44]Doctrines – Doctrine of legitimate expectation – Whether the HighCourt’s decision frustrates the legitimate expectation of the petitioners:Held: Rule 2(c)(iii) of the 1961 Rules provided at the material time that25% of the posts of District and Sessions Judges should be fi lled by directrecruitment from the Bar on the basis of aggregate marks/grade obtained inthe written examination and the viva-voce conducted by the High Court – Thescheme of examination specifi cally stipulates that there shall be no cut offmarks for the viva voce – The petitioners would have expected no minimumcut-off for the viva voce in view of the express stipulation in the scheme ofexamination – Both the above expectations of the petitioners are legitimateas they are based on the sanction of statutory rules, scheme of examination– The decision of the Administrative Committee to depart from the expectedcourse of preparing the merit list of the selected candidates is contrary to theunamended 1961 Rules – In the instant case, the requirement of a minimumcut-off for the viva-voce was introduced after the viva voce was conducted –The petitioners had no notice that such a requirement would be introduced forthe viva voce examination – The High Court’s decision to apply a minimumcut-off for the viva voce frustrated the substantive legitimate expectation ofthe petitioners – Since, the decision of the High Court is legally untenable andfails on the touchstone of fairness, consistency, and predictability, such a courseof action is arbitrary and violative of Article 14. [Paras 46, 47, 51 and 52] Principles – Principles of good administration:Held: The principles of good administration require that the decisionsof public authorities must withstand the test of consistency, transparency,and predictability to avoid being termed as arbitrary and violative of Article14. [Para 55]Doctrines – Doctrine of legitimate expectation – Limitation inapplication of:Held: A public authority must objectively demonstrate by placingrelevant material before the court that its decision was in the public interestto frustrate a claim of legitimate expectation. [Para 55]Directions – The High Court’s decision to apply a minimum cutofffor the viva voce frustrated the substantive legitimate expectationof the petitioners – The decision of the High Court is legally untenable– Whether the petitioners can be inducted into the Higher JudicialService:Held: In terms of relief, it would be contrary to the public interest todirect the induction of the petitioners into the Higher Judicial Service afterthe lapse of more than six years – Candidates who were selected nearly sixyears ago cannot be unseated – They were all qualifi ed and have been servingthe district judiciary of the state – Unseating them at this stage would becontrary to public interest – To induct the petitioners would be to bring innew candidates in preference to those who are holding judicial offi ce for alength of time – To deprive the State and its citizens of the benefi t of theseexperienced judicial offi cers at a senior position would not be in publicinterest.

        "HeadNote": "Issue for consideration: Rule 2(c)(iii) of the Kerala State HigherJudicial Services Special Rules 1961 stipulates that 25% of the posts in thecategory shall be fi lled by direct recruitment from the Bar “on the basis ofaggregate marks/grade obtained in a competitive examination and viva-voceconducted by the High Court”. The scheme of examination specifi callystipulated that there shall be no cut off marks for the viva voce. Whetherthe decision of the High Court to prescribe a cut-off for the viva-voceexamination was arbitrary.Kerala State Higher Judicial Services Special Rules 1961 – rule 2(c)(iii) – The scheme which was notifi ed by the High Court on 13.12.2012clearly specifi ed that there would be no cut off marks in respect of theviva-voce – However, the decision of the High Court to prescribe a cutofffor the viva-voce examination was taken much after the viva-vocetests were conducted – Propriety:Held: The Administrative Committee of the High Court decided toimpose a cut off for the viva-voce examination actuated by the bona fi dereason of ensuring that candidates with requisite personality assume judicialoffi ce – Such a change would be required to be brought in by a substantiveamendment to the Rules which came in much later – This is not a casewhere the rules or the scheme of the High Court were silent – Where thestatutory rules are silent, they can be supplemented in a manner consistent with the object and spirit of the Rules by an administrative order – In thepresent case, the statutory rules expressly provided that the select list wouldbe drawn up on the basis of the aggregate of marks obtained in the writtenexamination and the viva-voce – This was further elaborated in the schemeof examination which prescribed that there would be no cut off marks forthe viva-voce – This position is also refl ected in the notifi cation of the HighCourt dated 30.09.2015 – In this backdrop, the decision of the High Courtsuff ered from its being ultra vires the 1961 Rules besides being manifestlyarbitrary. [Paras 15 and 16]Doctrines – Doctrine of legitimate expectation – Claim under:Held: An individual who claims a benefi t or entitlement based on thedoctrine of legitimate expectation has to establish: (i) the legitimacy of theexpectation; and (ii) that the denial of the legitimate expectation led to theviolation of Article 14. [Para 44]Doctrines – Doctrine of legitimate expectation – Whether the HighCourt’s decision frustrates the legitimate expectation of the petitioners:Held: Rule 2(c)(iii) of the 1961 Rules provided at the material time that25% of the posts of District and Sessions Judges should be fi lled by directrecruitment from the Bar on the basis of aggregate marks/grade obtained inthe written examination and the viva-voce conducted by the High Court – Thescheme of examination specifi cally stipulates that there shall be no cut offmarks for the viva voce – The petitioners would have expected no minimumcut-off for the viva voce in view of the express stipulation in the scheme ofexamination – Both the above expectations of the petitioners are legitimateas they are based on the sanction of statutory rules, scheme of examination– The decision of the Administrative Committee to depart from the expectedcourse of preparing the merit list of the selected candidates is contrary to theunamended 1961 Rules – In the instant case, the requirement of a minimumcut-off for the viva-voce was introduced after the viva voce was conducted –The petitioners had no notice that such a requirement would be introduced forthe viva voce examination – The High Court’s decision to apply a minimumcut-off for the viva voce frustrated the substantive legitimate expectation ofthe petitioners – Since, the decision of the High Court is legally untenable andfails on the touchstone of fairness, consistency, and predictability, such a courseof action is arbitrary and violative of Article 14. [Paras 46, 47, 51 and 52] Principles – Principles of good administration:Held: The principles of good administration require that the decisionsof public authorities must withstand the test of consistency, transparency,and predictability to avoid being termed as arbitrary and violative of Article14. [Para 55]Doctrines – Doctrine of legitimate expectation – Limitation inapplication of:Held: A public authority must objectively demonstrate by placingrelevant material before the court that its decision was in the public interestto frustrate a claim of legitimate expectation. [Para 55]Directions – The High Court’s decision to apply a minimum cutofffor the viva voce frustrated the substantive legitimate expectationof the petitioners – The decision of the High Court is legally untenable– Whether the petitioners can be inducted into the Higher JudicialService:Held: In terms of relief, it would be contrary to the public interest todirect the induction of the petitioners into the Higher Judicial Service afterthe lapse of more than six years – Candidates who were selected nearly sixyears ago cannot be unseated – They were all qualifi ed and have been servingthe district judiciary of the state – Unseating them at this stage would becontrary to public interest – To induct the petitioners would be to bring innew candidates in preference to those who are holding judicial offi ce for alength of time – To deprive the State and its citizens of the benefi t of theseexperienced judicial offi cers at a senior position would not be in publicinterest.

[Para 63]Evidence – Dying declaration – Acceptability – Theory:Held: The juristic theory regarding the acceptability of a dyingdeclaration is that such declaration is made in extremity, when the partyis at the point of death and when every hope of this world is gone, whenevery motive to falsehood is silenced, and the man is induced by the mostpowerful consideration to speak only the truth – Notwithstanding the same,great caution must be exercised in considering the weight to be given to iton account of the existence of many circumstances which may aff ect theirtruth – The situation in which a man is on the deathbed is so solemn andserene, is the reason in law to accept the veracity of his statement – It is forthis reason, the requirements of oath and cross-examination are dispensedwith – Since, the accused has no power of cross-examination, the courtsinsist that the dying declaration should be of such a nature as to inspire fullconfi dence of the court in its truthfulness and correctness – However, thecourt should always be on guard to see that the statement of the deceased wasnot as a result of either tutoring or prompting or a product of imagination.[Para 43] Evidence – Dying declaration – Reliance upon – Factors to beconsidered – Duty of the Court:Held: Despite a general consensus of presuming that the dyingdeclaration is true, they have not been stricto-sensu accepted, rather thegeneral course of action has been that judge decides whether the essentialsof a dying declaration are met and if it can be admissible, once done, it isupon the duty of the court to see the extent to which the dying declarationis entitled to credit – Thus, there is no hard and fast rule for determiningwhen a dying declaration should be accepted – Duty of the Court is to decidethis question in the facts and surrounding circumstances of the case and befully convinced of the truthfulness of the same – Factors to be considered,enumerated. [Paras 60 and 62]Evidence Act, 1872 – s.8 – Conduct:The conduct of the accused may be unnatural because he was residingin the very same house, however, the conduct which may be a relevant factu/s.8, by itself may not be suffi cient to hold a person guilty of the off enceof murder – Penal Code, 1860 – s.302. [Para 46]Evidence – Dying declaration – Sanctity/presumption attachedto – Justifi cation for:The justifi cation for the sanctity/presumption attached to a dyingdeclaration is two fold- (i) ethically and religiously it is presumed that aperson while at the brink of death will not lie, whereas (ii) from a publicpolicy perspective it is to tackle a situation where the only witness to thecrime is not available. [Para 64]Evidence – Dying declaration – Suspicion as regards correctnessof – Duty of Court:It is unsafe to record the conviction on the basis of a dying declarationalone in the cases where suspicion, like the case on hand is raised, as regardsthe correctness of the dying declaration – In such cases, the Court may haveto look for some corroborative evidence by treating the dying declarationonly as a piece of evidence – The evidence and material available on recordmust be properly weighed in each case to arrive at an appropriate conclusion.[Para 48]",

[Para 63]Evidence – Dying declaration – Acceptability – Theory:Held: The juristic theory regarding the acceptability of a dyingdeclaration is that such declaration is made in extremity, when the partyis at the point of death and when every hope of this world is gone, whenevery motive to falsehood is silenced, and the man is induced by the mostpowerful consideration to speak only the truth – Notwithstanding the same,great caution must be exercised in considering the weight to be given to iton account of the existence of many circumstances which may aff ect theirtruth – The situation in which a man is on the deathbed is so solemn andserene, is the reason in law to accept the veracity of his statement – It is forthis reason, the requirements of oath and cross-examination are dispensedwith – Since, the accused has no power of cross-examination, the courtsinsist that the dying declaration should be of such a nature as to inspire fullconfi dence of the court in its truthfulness and correctness – However, thecourt should always be on guard to see that the statement of the deceased wasnot as a result of either tutoring or prompting or a product of imagination.[Para 43] Evidence – Dying declaration – Reliance upon – Factors to beconsidered – Duty of the Court:Held: Despite a general consensus of presuming that the dyingdeclaration is true, they have not been stricto-sensu accepted, rather thegeneral course of action has been that judge decides whether the essentialsof a dying declaration are met and if it can be admissible, once done, it isupon the duty of the court to see the extent to which the dying declarationis entitled to credit – Thus, there is no hard and fast rule for determiningwhen a dying declaration should be accepted – Duty of the Court is to decidethis question in the facts and surrounding circumstances of the case and befully convinced of the truthfulness of the same – Factors to be considered,enumerated. [Paras 60 and 62]Evidence Act, 1872 – s.8 – Conduct:The conduct of the accused may be unnatural because he was residingin the very same house, however, the conduct which may be a relevant factu/s.8, by itself may not be suffi cient to hold a person guilty of the off enceof murder – Penal Code, 1860 – s.302."

[Paras 60 and 62]Evidence Act, 1872 – s.8 – Conduct:The conduct of the accused may be unnatural because he was residingin the very same house, however, the conduct which may be a relevant factu/s.8, by itself may not be suffi cient to hold a person guilty of the off enceof murder – Penal Code, 1860 – s.302. [Para 46]Evidence – Dying declaration – Sanctity/presumption attachedto – Justifi cation for:The justifi cation for the sanctity/presumption attached to a dyingdeclaration is two fold- (i) ethically and religiously it is presumed that aperson while at the brink of death will not lie, whereas (ii) from a publicpolicy perspective it is to tackle a situation where the only witness to thecrime is not available. [Para 64]Evidence – Dying declaration – Suspicion as regards correctnessof – Duty of Court:It is unsafe to record the conviction on the basis of a dying declarationalone in the cases where suspicion, like the case on hand is raised, as regardsthe correctness of the dying declaration – In such cases, the Court may haveto look for some corroborative evidence by treating the dying declarationonly as a piece of evidence – The evidence and material available on recordmust be properly weighed in each case to arrive at an appropriate conclusion.[Para 48]",

[Paras 23, 34, 44 and 48]Service Law – Interim relief for continuation in service granted– Impropriety:Held: Court or the Tribunal should be slow and circumspect in grantinginterim relief for continuation in service, unless prima facie evidence ofunimpeachable character is produced because if the public servant succeeds,he can always be compensated – But if he fails, he would have enjoyedundeserved benefi t of extended service and caused injustice to his immediatejunior – In the present case, High Court went to the extent of granting interimrelief extending the period of service beyond 60 years till the disposal ofthe Original Petition by the CAT – By virtue of such interim order whichthe High Court ordinarily should not grant, the respondent No. 1 althoughwas to retire in 2018 yet continued in service till 2021 – It is only whenSupreme Court stayed the operation of the impugned order passed by theHigh Court while issuing notice that the service of the respondent No.1came to an end. [Para 48]Service Law – Memorandum of Association of the Central Councilfor Research in Ayurvedic Sciences – Bye-Laws – Clauses 25(b), 34, 35and 47 – Plea of respondent No.1 was that the provisions of FR 56(bb)would apply to him in his capacity as an employee of the Council in viewof Clause 35, Bye-Laws of the Council by which the provisions of the FRand SR would apply to the employees of the Council mutatis mutandis:Held: Clauses 25(b), 34, 35 and 47 of the Bye-Laws in the Memorandumof Association indicate that the employees are recruited through a selectioncommittee of the Council – It further indicates that the Fundamental Rules,1922 will have no direct application in cases where the governing bodyfi nalises the rules of superannuation – In terms of Clause 34 of the Bye-Laws,the governing body had decided the age of superannuation to be 60 yearson 01.12.1998 – The said decision was ratifi ed on 27.01.2000 - CAT rightly took the view that the plea canvassed on behalf of the respondent No.1 thatthe Council failed to consider the Clause 35 of the Bye-Laws which statesthat the FR, Supplementary Rule (SR) and General Financial Rules (GFR)as amended from time to time shall apply mutatis mutandis to employeesof the Council, was without any merit and deserved to be rejected – CATrightly rejected such argument because the applicability would be subjectto the provision specifi c to the Clause 34 governing superannuation of theemployees of the Council – There is nothing in Clause 35 of the Bye-Lawson the basis of which, it could be said that the same will have an overridingeff ect on Clause 34 as regards the age of retirement – Clause 47 of the Bye-Laws makes it abundantly clear that for the matters not specifi cally providedin the Bye-Laws, the rules applicable to the government employees wouldapply – However, as there is a specifi c provision regarding superannuationin Clause 34, the rules governing the government services in respect ofsuperannuation are not applicable to the employees of the Council unlessit is in accordance with Clause 34 of the Bye-Laws – Fundamental Rules,1922. [Paras 25, 28 and 29]Words and Phrases – “or”, “and” – Interpretation – Plea ofrespondent No.1 that clause 34 of the Bye-Laws should be read in twoparts- the fi rst part states that the Rules governing the retirement ofemployees of the Government of India as amended from time to timewould apply to the employees of the Central Council; the second partof Clause 34 which reads “or as desired by the governing body” ismerely an enabling provision empowering the governing body to takea decision whether an employee deserves to be retained beyond theprescribed age of superannuation and that such power should not beread in a negative form to clothe the governing body with the power toprescribe lesser age of superannuation than what has been prescribedby the Central Government from time to time:Held: Such argument cannot be accepted – The word “or” is normallydisjunctive and the word “and” is normally conjunctive – Both of themcan be read as vice-versa, but that interpretation is adopted only where theintention of the legislature is manifest – In the present case, the language ofClause 34 is very clear. What is important to note while reading the Clause34 is the word “or” – Thereafter, there is a proviso which says that an employee can be retained in service after prescribed age of superannuationif he continues to be physically fi t and effi cient and it is in the interest ofthe Central Counsel to retain him in the service – The expression “the rulesgoverning the retirement of employees of Government of India as amendedfrom time to time” is separated from the rest of the part of the Bye-Law by theword “or” which is disjunctive and giving natural meaning to the said wordseparates the rules that may be framed by the Government of India and therules that the Council may desire to frame as regards the age of retirementof the employees of the Council – Interpretation of Statutes. [Paras 30-32]Service Law – Age of retirement vis-à-vis service conditionsrelating to pay and allowances and revision of pay – RespondentNo.1 contended that as the terms and conditions of the services of theemployees of the Council on all other aspects like the Provident Fund/GPF, Pension, Gratuity, Leave Rules, Scales of Pay, Conduct Rules andother conditions of services are the same as applicable to the employeesof the Central Government as set out in Clauses 31, 32, 33, 42, 44 and47 respectively of the Bye-Laws, the matter of age of superannuationof the respondent No. 1 should not be treated diff erently:Held: What should be the age of superannuation is a matter of policy– It is not within the domain of the court to legislate – It is only if a policydecision or a notifi cation is arbitrary it may invite the frowns of Article 14of the Constitution – The question of age of retirement stands on a diff erentfooting from the service conditions relating to pay and allowances andrevision of pay. [Para 35]Service Law – Claim of respondent No.1-Research Assistantthat his age of superannuation be at par with the AYUSH Doctors –Infringement of Article 14 alleged:Held: It is too late in the day for the respondent No.1 to raise allsuch issues including infringement of Article 14 on the ground of artifi cialdistinction between the Research Assistant and AYUSH Doctors –Respondent No.1 knew from the date of his appointment that he was beingappointed as a Research Assistant – His service conditions and mode ofrecruitment are diff erent compared to the AYUSH Doctors – It is a diff erentthing that he might have treated the patients but that by itself would not entitle him to claim that his age of superannuation should be at par with theAYUSH Doctors – Present case is not one of discrimination – Article 14 hasno application having regard to the facts of the present case – Constitutionof India – Article 14. [Paras 37 and 39]Constitution of India – Article 226 – Extraordinary jurisdiction– Principles of law governing – Issue of Writ of certiorari – Discussed",

[Paras 23, 34, 44 and 48]Service Law – Interim relief for continuation in service granted– Impropriety:Held: Court or the Tribunal should be slow and circumspect in grantinginterim relief for continuation in service, unless prima facie evidence ofunimpeachable character is produced because if the public servant succeeds,he can always be compensated – But if he fails, he would have enjoyedundeserved benefi t of extended service and caused injustice to his immediatejunior – In the present case, High Court went to the extent of granting interimrelief extending the period of service beyond 60 years till the disposal ofthe Original Petition by the CAT – By virtue of such interim order whichthe High Court ordinarily should not grant, the respondent No. 1 althoughwas to retire in 2018 yet continued in service till 2021 – It is only whenSupreme Court stayed the operation of the impugned order passed by theHigh Court while issuing notice that the service of the respondent No.1came to an end. [Para 48]Service Law – Memorandum of Association of the Central Councilfor Research in Ayurvedic Sciences – Bye-Laws – Clauses 25(b), 34, 35and 47 – Plea of respondent No.1 was that the provisions of FR 56(bb)would apply to him in his capacity as an employee of the Council in viewof Clause 35, Bye-Laws of the Council by which the provisions of the FRand SR would apply to the employees of the Council mutatis mutandis:Held: Clauses 25(b), 34, 35 and 47 of the Bye-Laws in the Memorandumof Association indicate that the employees are recruited through a selectioncommittee of the Council – It further indicates that the Fundamental Rules,1922 will have no direct application in cases where the governing bodyfi nalises the rules of superannuation – In terms of Clause 34 of the Bye-Laws,the governing body had decided the age of superannuation to be 60 yearson 01.12.1998 – The said decision was ratifi ed on 27.01.2000 - CAT rightly took the view that the plea canvassed on behalf of the respondent No.1 thatthe Council failed to consider the Clause 35 of the Bye-Laws which statesthat the FR, Supplementary Rule (SR) and General Financial Rules (GFR)as amended from time to time shall apply mutatis mutandis to employeesof the Council, was without any merit and deserved to be rejected – CATrightly rejected such argument because the applicability would be subjectto the provision specifi c to the Clause 34 governing superannuation of theemployees of the Council – There is nothing in Clause 35 of the Bye-Lawson the basis of which, it could be said that the same will have an overridingeff ect on Clause 34 as regards the age of retirement – Clause 47 of the Bye-Laws makes it abundantly clear that for the matters not specifi cally providedin the Bye-Laws, the rules applicable to the government employees wouldapply – However, as there is a specifi c provision regarding superannuationin Clause 34, the rules governing the government services in respect ofsuperannuation are not applicable to the employees of the Council unlessit is in accordance with Clause 34 of the Bye-Laws – Fundamental Rules,1922. [Paras 25, 28 and 29]Words and Phrases – “or”, “and” – Interpretation – Plea ofrespondent No.1 that clause 34 of the Bye-Laws should be read in twoparts- the fi rst part states that the Rules governing the retirement ofemployees of the Government of India as amended from time to timewould apply to the employees of the Central Council; the second partof Clause 34 which reads “or as desired by the governing body” ismerely an enabling provision empowering the governing body to takea decision whether an employee deserves to be retained beyond theprescribed age of superannuation and that such power should not beread in a negative form to clothe the governing body with the power toprescribe lesser age of superannuation than what has been prescribedby the Central Government from time to time:Held: Such argument cannot be accepted – The word “or” is normallydisjunctive and the word “and” is normally conjunctive – Both of themcan be read as vice-versa, but that interpretation is adopted only where theintention of the legislature is manifest – In the present case, the language ofClause 34 is very clear. What is important to note while reading the Clause34 is the word “or” – Thereafter, there is a proviso which says that an employee can be retained in service after prescribed age of superannuationif he continues to be physically fi t and effi cient and it is in the interest ofthe Central Counsel to retain him in the service – The expression “the rulesgoverning the retirement of employees of Government of India as amendedfrom time to time” is separated from the rest of the part of the Bye-Law by theword “or” which is disjunctive and giving natural meaning to the said wordseparates the rules that may be framed by the Government of India and therules that the Council may desire to frame as regards the age of retirementof the employees of the Council – Interpretation of Statutes. [Paras 30-32]Service Law – Age of retirement vis-à-vis service conditionsrelating to pay and allowances and revision of pay – RespondentNo.1 contended that as the terms and conditions of the services of theemployees of the Council on all other aspects like the Provident Fund/GPF, Pension, Gratuity, Leave Rules, Scales of Pay, Conduct Rules andother conditions of services are the same as applicable to the employeesof the Central Government as set out in Clauses 31, 32, 33, 42, 44 and47 respectively of the Bye-Laws, the matter of age of superannuationof the respondent No. 1 should not be treated diff erently:Held: What should be the age of superannuation is a matter of policy– It is not within the domain of the court to legislate – It is only if a policydecision or a notifi cation is arbitrary it may invite the frowns of Article 14of the Constitution – The question of age of retirement stands on a diff erentfooting from the service conditions relating to pay and allowances andrevision of pay. [Para 35]Service Law – Claim of respondent No.1-Research Assistantthat his age of superannuation be at par with the AYUSH Doctors –Infringement of Article 14 alleged:Held: It is too late in the day for the respondent No.1 to raise allsuch issues including infringement of Article 14 on the ground of artifi cialdistinction between the Research Assistant and AYUSH Doctors –Respondent No.1 knew from the date of his appointment that he was beingappointed as a Research Assistant – His service conditions and mode ofrecruitment are diff erent compared to the AYUSH Doctors – It is a diff erentthing that he might have treated the patients but that by itself would not entitle him to claim that his age of superannuation should be at par with theAYUSH Doctors – Present case is not one of discrimination – Article 14 hasno application having regard to the facts of the present case – Constitutionof India – Article 14. [Paras 37 and 39]Constitution of India – Article 226 – Extraordinary jurisdiction– Principles of law governing – Issue of Writ of certiorari – Discussed",

[Para 48]Service Law – Memorandum of Association of the Central Councilfor Research in Ayurvedic Sciences – Bye-Laws – Clauses 25(b), 34, 35and 47 – Plea of respondent No.1 was that the provisions of FR 56(bb)would apply to him in his capacity as an employee of the Council in viewof Clause 35, Bye-Laws of the Council by which the provisions of the FRand SR would apply to the employees of the Council mutatis mutandis:Held: Clauses 25(b), 34, 35 and 47 of the Bye-Laws in the Memorandumof Association indicate that the employees are recruited through a selectioncommittee of the Council – It further indicates that the Fundamental Rules,1922 will have no direct application in cases where the governing bodyfi nalises the rules of superannuation – In terms of Clause 34 of the Bye-Laws,the governing body had decided the age of superannuation to be 60 yearson 01.12.1998 – The said decision was ratifi ed on 27.01.2000 - CAT rightly took the view that the plea canvassed on behalf of the respondent No.1 thatthe Council failed to consider the Clause 35 of the Bye-Laws which statesthat the FR, Supplementary Rule (SR) and General Financial Rules (GFR)as amended from time to time shall apply mutatis mutandis to employeesof the Council, was without any merit and deserved to be rejected – CATrightly rejected such argument because the applicability would be subjectto the provision specifi c to the Clause 34 governing superannuation of theemployees of the Council – There is nothing in Clause 35 of the Bye-Lawson the basis of which, it could be said that the same will have an overridingeff ect on Clause 34 as regards the age of retirement – Clause 47 of the Bye-Laws makes it abundantly clear that for the matters not specifi cally providedin the Bye-Laws, the rules applicable to the government employees wouldapply – However, as there is a specifi c provision regarding superannuationin Clause 34, the rules governing the government services in respect ofsuperannuation are not applicable to the employees of the Council unlessit is in accordance with Clause 34 of the Bye-Laws – Fundamental Rules,1922. [Paras 25, 28 and 29]Words and Phrases – “or”, “and” – Interpretation – Plea ofrespondent No.1 that clause 34 of the Bye-Laws should be read in twoparts- the fi rst part states that the Rules governing the retirement ofemployees of the Government of India as amended from time to timewould apply to the employees of the Central Council; the second partof Clause 34 which reads “or as desired by the governing body” ismerely an enabling provision empowering the governing body to takea decision whether an employee deserves to be retained beyond theprescribed age of superannuation and that such power should not beread in a negative form to clothe the governing body with the power toprescribe lesser age of superannuation than what has been prescribedby the Central Government from time to time:Held: Such argument cannot be accepted – The word “or” is normallydisjunctive and the word “and” is normally conjunctive – Both of themcan be read as vice-versa, but that interpretation is adopted only where theintention of the legislature is manifest – In the present case, the language ofClause 34 is very clear. What is important to note while reading the Clause34 is the word “or” – Thereafter, there is a proviso which says that an employee can be retained in service after prescribed age of superannuationif he continues to be physically fi t and effi cient and it is in the interest ofthe Central Counsel to retain him in the service – The expression “the rulesgoverning the retirement of employees of Government of India as amendedfrom time to time” is separated from the rest of the part of the Bye-Law by theword “or” which is disjunctive and giving natural meaning to the said wordseparates the rules that may be framed by the Government of India and therules that the Council may desire to frame as regards the age of retirementof the employees of the Council – Interpretation of Statutes. [Paras 30-32]Service Law – Age of retirement vis-à-vis service conditionsrelating to pay and allowances and revision of pay – RespondentNo.1 contended that as the terms and conditions of the services of theemployees of the Council on all other aspects like the Provident Fund/GPF, Pension, Gratuity, Leave Rules, Scales of Pay, Conduct Rules andother conditions of services are the same as applicable to the employeesof the Central Government as set out in Clauses 31, 32, 33, 42, 44 and47 respectively of the Bye-Laws, the matter of age of superannuationof the respondent No. 1 should not be treated diff erently:Held: What should be the age of superannuation is a matter of policy– It is not within the domain of the court to legislate – It is only if a policydecision or a notifi cation is arbitrary it may invite the frowns of Article 14of the Constitution – The question of age of retirement stands on a diff erentfooting from the service conditions relating to pay and allowances andrevision of pay. [Para 35]Service Law – Claim of respondent No.1-Research Assistantthat his age of superannuation be at par with the AYUSH Doctors –Infringement of Article 14 alleged:Held: It is too late in the day for the respondent No.1 to raise allsuch issues including infringement of Article 14 on the ground of artifi cialdistinction between the Research Assistant and AYUSH Doctors –Respondent No.1 knew from the date of his appointment that he was beingappointed as a Research Assistant – His service conditions and mode ofrecruitment are diff erent compared to the AYUSH Doctors – It is a diff erentthing that he might have treated the patients but that by itself would not entitle him to claim that his age of superannuation should be at par with theAYUSH Doctors – Present case is not one of discrimination – Article 14 hasno application having regard to the facts of the present case – Constitutionof India – Article 14.

[Para 32]Evidence Act, 1872 – ss.145, 161 – Duty of defence counsel, publicprosecutor:Held: It was the duty of the defence counsel to confront the witnesseswith their police statements so as to prove the contradictions in the formof material omissions and bring them on record – The defence counsel hadno idea how to contradict a witness with his or her police statements inaccordance w/s.145, Evidence Act – Lapse on the part of public prosecutoris also very unfortunate – The public prosecutor knew that the witnesseswere deposing something contrary to what they had stated before the policein their statements recorded u/s.161 – It was his duty to bring to the noticeof the witnesses and confront them with the same even without declaringthem as hostile – If the witness was not confronted with that part of thestatement with which the defence wanted to contradict him, then the Courtcannot suo motu make use of statements to police not proved in compliancew/s.145, Evidence Act – Therefore, it is of utmost importance to proveall major contradictions in the form of material omissions in accordancewith the procedure as established u/s.145, Evidence Act and bring them onrecord – It is the duty of the defence counsel to do so . [Paras 41 and 50]Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 – Chapter XXVIII- ss.366-371; Chapter XXIX- ss.372-394 – Role and duty of High Court inconfi rmation cases:Held: Power to acquit the person can be exercised by the High Courteven without there being any substantive appeal on the part of the accusedchallenging his conviction – To that extent, the proceedings under ChapterXXVIII which deal with “submission of death sentences for confirmation” is a proceeding in continuation of the trial – ss.367, 368 entitle the HighCourt to direct further enquiry or to take additional evidence and the HighCourt may, in a given case, even acquit the accused person – Scope ofthe chapter is wider – Chapter XXIX deals with “Appeals” – s.391 alsoentitles the appellate court to take further evidence or direct such furtherevidence to be taken – s.386 then enumerates powers of the appellate courtwhich inter alia includes the power to “reverse the fi nding and sentenceand acquit or discharge the accused, or order him to be re-tried by a courtof competent jurisdiction subordinate to such appellate court or committedfor trial” – Powers of the appellate court are equally wide – The High Courtin the present case was exercising powers both u/Chapters XXVIII andXXIX, CrPC – ss.367, 368 make it clear that the duty of the High Court, indealing with the reference, is not only to see whether the order passed bythe Sessions Judge is correct, but to examine the case for itself and evendirect a further enquiry or the taking of additional evidence if considereddesirable in order to ascertain the guilt or the innocence of the convictedperson. [Paras 58 and 59]Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 – ss.367, 368 and proviso thereto– Duty of High Court u/s.367:Held: Under the proviso to s.368, no order of confi rmation is to bemade until the period allowed for preferring the appeal has expired, or, ifan appeal is presented within such period, until such appeal is disposedof, so that, if an appeal is fi led by a condemned prisoner, that appeal hasto be disposed of before any order is made in the reference confi rming thesentence of death – In disposing of such an appeal, however, it is necessarythat the High Court should keep in view its duty u/s.367 – It must examinethe appeal record for itself, arrive at a view whether a further enquiryor taking of additional evidence is desirable or not, and then come to itsown conclusion on the entire material on record whether conviction ofthe condemned prisoner is justifi ed and the sentence of death should beconfi rmed. [Para 59]Criminal Law – Criminal justice system – Accusatorial/adversarialsystem:Held: For the dispensation of criminal justice, India follows theaccusatorial or adversarial system of common law – In the accusatorial or adversarial system, the accused is presumed to be innocent; prosecution anddefence each put their case; judge acts as an impartial umpire and whileacting as a neutral umpire sees whether the prosecution has been able toprove its case beyond reasonable doubt or not. [Para 66]Constitution of India – Article 21 – Free and fair trial, a sine-quanon:Held: Free and fair trial is sine-qua-non of Article 21 – If the criminaltrial is not free and fair, then the confi dence of the public in the judicialfairness of a judge and the justice delivery system would be shaken – Denialto fair trial is as much injustice to the accused as to the victim and the society– No trial can be treated as a fair trial unless there is an impartial judgeconducting the trial, an honest, able and fair defence counsel and equallyhonest, able and fair public prosecutor – A fair trial necessarily includes fairand proper opportunity to the prosecutor to prove the guilt of the accusedand opportunity to the accused to prove his innocence.

[Paras 39, 40, 43, 47 and 73]Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 – s.162 – Proviso – ‘Purpose’mentioned therein:Held: s.162 says that no statement made by any person to a policeoffi cer in the course of an investigation, whether it be recorded or not, shallbe used for the purpose save as provided in the fi rst proviso to the Section– The fi rst proviso says that when any witness, whose statement has beenreduced into writing by the police in accordance with the provisions ofthe CrPC, is called for the prosecution in inquiry or trial the accused withthe permission of the court may contradict the witnesses in the mannerprovided by s.145, Evidence Act – The purpose mentioned in the provisois the purpose of contradicting the evidence given in favour of the State bya prosecution witness in Court by the use of the previous statement madeby such witness to the police offi cer – Purpose is to discredit the evidencegiven in favour of the prosecution by a witness for the State – The Sectionprohibits the use of the statement for any other purpose than this – It doesnot say that the statement can only be used at the request of the accused– The limitation or restriction imposed in the fi rst part of s.162 relates tothis purpose for which the statement may be used; it does not relate to theprocedure which may be adopted to eff ect this purpose – The proviso whichsets out the limited purpose also mentions the way in which an accusedperson may contradict the witness with his previous statement made to thePolice, but it does not in any other way aff ect the power that lies in the Courtto look into documents or put questions to witnesses suo motu – EvidenceAct, 1872 – s.165. [Para 46] Practice and Procedure – Criminal Law – Duty of Presiding Judge– Evidence Act, 1872 – s.165:Held: In many sessions cases when an advocate appointed by theCourt appears and particularly when a junior advocate not having muchexperience of the procedure of the Court, has been appointed to conductthe defence of an accused person, it is the duty of the Presiding Judge todraw his attention to the statutory provisions of s.145, Evidence Act – NoCourt should allow a witness to be contradicted by reference to the previousstatement in writing or reduced to writing unless the procedure set out ins.145, Evidence Act has been followed – It is possible that if the attention ofthe witness is drawn to these portions with reference to which it is proposedto contradict him, he may be able to give a perfectly satisfactory explanationand in that event the portion in the previous statement which would otherwisebe contradictory would no longer go to contradict or challenge the testimonyof the witness – In a case like the present one, where the evidence given inCourt implicates persons who not mentioned in the FIR or police statements,it is always advisable and far more important for the Trial Judge to look intothe police papers in order to ascertain whether the persons implicated bywitnesses, at the trial had been implicated by them during the investigation.[Paras 47 and 48]Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 – s.53(1), 53A – Medicalexamination – Importance – Circumstantial evidence – Rape victimdead:Held: s.53(1) enables a police offi cer not below the rank of subinspectorto request a registered medical practitioner, to make such anexamination of the person arrested, as is reasonably necessary to ascertainthe facts which may aff ord such evidence, whenever a person is arrested ona charge of committing an off ence of such a nature that there are reasonablegrounds for believing that an examination of his person will aff ord evidenceas to the commission of an off ence – By Amendment Act 25 of 2005, a newExplanation was substituted u/s.53, in the place of the original Explanation– Simultaneously with the substitution of a new Explanation u/s.53, Act25 of 2005 also inserted a new provision i.e. s.53A – Medical examinationof an accused assumes great importance in cases where the victim of rapeis dead and the off ence is sought to be established only by circumstantialevidence – Penal Code, 1860 – ss.302, 376 – Code of Criminal Procedure(Amendment) Act, 2005. [Paras 25-27 and 29] Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 – s.313 – Additionalcircumstances relied upon, not put to the appellant – Impropriety:Held: The further statement of the appellant-convict was recordedu/s. 313 – It was shocking to see the manner in which the Trial Court recordedthe same – In all, four questions were put to the appellant to enable him toexplain the incriminating circumstances pointing towards his complicity inthe alleged crime – However, for holding the appellant guilty of the allegedcrime, the Trial Court looked into the additional circumstances none ofwhich were put to the appellant so that he could off er a proper explanationto the same. [Para 32]Evidence Act, 1872 – ss.145, 161 – Duty of defence counsel, publicprosecutor:Held: It was the duty of the defence counsel to confront the witnesseswith their police statements so as to prove the contradictions in the formof material omissions and bring them on record – The defence counsel hadno idea how to contradict a witness with his or her police statements inaccordance w/s.145, Evidence Act – Lapse on the part of public prosecutoris also very unfortunate – The public prosecutor knew that the witnesseswere deposing something contrary to what they had stated before the policein their statements recorded u/s.161 – It was his duty to bring to the noticeof the witnesses and confront them with the same even without declaringthem as hostile – If the witness was not confronted with that part of thestatement with which the defence wanted to contradict him, then the Courtcannot suo motu make use of statements to police not proved in compliancew/s.145, Evidence Act – Therefore, it is of utmost importance to proveall major contradictions in the form of material omissions in accordancewith the procedure as established u/s.145, Evidence Act and bring them onrecord – It is the duty of the defence counsel to do so . [Paras 41 and 50]Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 – Chapter XXVIII- ss.366-371; Chapter XXIX- ss.372-394 – Role and duty of High Court inconfi rmation cases:Held: Power to acquit the person can be exercised by the High Courteven without there being any substantive appeal on the part of the accusedchallenging his conviction – To that extent, the proceedings under ChapterXXVIII which deal with “submission of death sentences for confirmation” is a proceeding in continuation of the trial – ss.367, 368 entitle the HighCourt to direct further enquiry or to take additional evidence and the HighCourt may, in a given case, even acquit the accused person – Scope ofthe chapter is wider – Chapter XXIX deals with “Appeals” – s.391 alsoentitles the appellate court to take further evidence or direct such furtherevidence to be taken – s.386 then enumerates powers of the appellate courtwhich inter alia includes the power to “reverse the fi nding and sentenceand acquit or discharge the accused, or order him to be re-tried by a courtof competent jurisdiction subordinate to such appellate court or committedfor trial” – Powers of the appellate court are equally wide – The High Courtin the present case was exercising powers both u/Chapters XXVIII andXXIX, CrPC – ss.367, 368 make it clear that the duty of the High Court, indealing with the reference, is not only to see whether the order passed bythe Sessions Judge is correct, but to examine the case for itself and evendirect a further enquiry or the taking of additional evidence if considereddesirable in order to ascertain the guilt or the innocence of the convictedperson. [Paras 58 and 59]Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 – ss.367, 368 and proviso thereto– Duty of High Court u/s.367:Held: Under the proviso to s.368, no order of confi rmation is to bemade until the period allowed for preferring the appeal has expired, or, ifan appeal is presented within such period, until such appeal is disposedof, so that, if an appeal is fi led by a condemned prisoner, that appeal hasto be disposed of before any order is made in the reference confi rming thesentence of death – In disposing of such an appeal, however, it is necessarythat the High Court should keep in view its duty u/s.367 – It must examinethe appeal record for itself, arrive at a view whether a further enquiryor taking of additional evidence is desirable or not, and then come to itsown conclusion on the entire material on record whether conviction ofthe condemned prisoner is justifi ed and the sentence of death should beconfi rmed. [Para 59]Criminal Law – Criminal justice system – Accusatorial/adversarialsystem:Held: For the dispensation of criminal justice, India follows theaccusatorial or adversarial system of common law – In the accusatorial or adversarial system, the accused is presumed to be innocent; prosecution anddefence each put their case; judge acts as an impartial umpire and whileacting as a neutral umpire sees whether the prosecution has been able toprove its case beyond reasonable doubt or not. [Para 66]Constitution of India – Article 21 – Free and fair trial, a sine-quanon:Held: Free and fair trial is sine-qua-non of Article 21 – If the criminaltrial is not free and fair, then the confi dence of the public in the judicialfairness of a judge and the justice delivery system would be shaken – Denialto fair trial is as much injustice to the accused as to the victim and the society– No trial can be treated as a fair trial unless there is an impartial judgeconducting the trial, an honest, able and fair defence counsel and equallyhonest, able and fair public prosecutor – A fair trial necessarily includes fairand proper opportunity to the prosecutor to prove the guilt of the accusedand opportunity to the accused to prove his innocence.

[Paras 39, 40, 43, 47 and 73]Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 – s.162 – Proviso – ‘Purpose’mentioned therein:Held: s.162 says that no statement made by any person to a policeoffi cer in the course of an investigation, whether it be recorded or not, shallbe used for the purpose save as provided in the fi rst proviso to the Section– The fi rst proviso says that when any witness, whose statement has beenreduced into writing by the police in accordance with the provisions ofthe CrPC, is called for the prosecution in inquiry or trial the accused withthe permission of the court may contradict the witnesses in the mannerprovided by s.145, Evidence Act – The purpose mentioned in the provisois the purpose of contradicting the evidence given in favour of the State bya prosecution witness in Court by the use of the previous statement madeby such witness to the police offi cer – Purpose is to discredit the evidencegiven in favour of the prosecution by a witness for the State – The Sectionprohibits the use of the statement for any other purpose than this – It doesnot say that the statement can only be used at the request of the accused– The limitation or restriction imposed in the fi rst part of s.162 relates tothis purpose for which the statement may be used; it does not relate to theprocedure which may be adopted to eff ect this purpose – The proviso whichsets out the limited purpose also mentions the way in which an accusedperson may contradict the witness with his previous statement made to thePolice, but it does not in any other way aff ect the power that lies in the Courtto look into documents or put questions to witnesses suo motu – EvidenceAct, 1872 – s.165. [Para 46] Practice and Procedure – Criminal Law – Duty of Presiding Judge– Evidence Act, 1872 – s.165:Held: In many sessions cases when an advocate appointed by theCourt appears and particularly when a junior advocate not having muchexperience of the procedure of the Court, has been appointed to conductthe defence of an accused person, it is the duty of the Presiding Judge todraw his attention to the statutory provisions of s.145, Evidence Act – NoCourt should allow a witness to be contradicted by reference to the previousstatement in writing or reduced to writing unless the procedure set out ins.145, Evidence Act has been followed – It is possible that if the attention ofthe witness is drawn to these portions with reference to which it is proposedto contradict him, he may be able to give a perfectly satisfactory explanationand in that event the portion in the previous statement which would otherwisebe contradictory would no longer go to contradict or challenge the testimonyof the witness – In a case like the present one, where the evidence given inCourt implicates persons who not mentioned in the FIR or police statements,it is always advisable and far more important for the Trial Judge to look intothe police papers in order to ascertain whether the persons implicated bywitnesses, at the trial had been implicated by them during the investigation.[Paras 47 and 48]Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 – s.53(1), 53A – Medicalexamination – Importance – Circumstantial evidence – Rape victimdead:Held: s.53(1) enables a police offi cer not below the rank of subinspectorto request a registered medical practitioner, to make such anexamination of the person arrested, as is reasonably necessary to ascertainthe facts which may aff ord such evidence, whenever a person is arrested ona charge of committing an off ence of such a nature that there are reasonablegrounds for believing that an examination of his person will aff ord evidenceas to the commission of an off ence – By Amendment Act 25 of 2005, a newExplanation was substituted u/s.53, in the place of the original Explanation– Simultaneously with the substitution of a new Explanation u/s.53, Act25 of 2005 also inserted a new provision i.e. s.53A – Medical examinationof an accused assumes great importance in cases where the victim of rapeis dead and the off ence is sought to be established only by circumstantialevidence – Penal Code, 1860 – ss.302, 376 – Code of Criminal Procedure(Amendment) Act, 2005. [Paras 25-27 and 29] Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 – s.313 – Additionalcircumstances relied upon, not put to the appellant – Impropriety:Held: The further statement of the appellant-convict was recordedu/s. 313 – It was shocking to see the manner in which the Trial Court recordedthe same – In all, four questions were put to the appellant to enable him toexplain the incriminating circumstances pointing towards his complicity inthe alleged crime – However, for holding the appellant guilty of the allegedcrime, the Trial Court looked into the additional circumstances none ofwhich were put to the appellant so that he could off er a proper explanationto the same. [Para 32]Evidence Act, 1872 – ss.145, 161 – Duty of defence counsel, publicprosecutor:Held: It was the duty of the defence counsel to confront the witnesseswith their police statements so as to prove the contradictions in the formof material omissions and bring them on record – The defence counsel hadno idea how to contradict a witness with his or her police statements inaccordance w/s.145, Evidence Act – Lapse on the part of public prosecutoris also very unfortunate – The public prosecutor knew that the witnesseswere deposing something contrary to what they had stated before the policein their statements recorded u/s.161 – It was his duty to bring to the noticeof the witnesses and confront them with the same even without declaringthem as hostile – If the witness was not confronted with that part of thestatement with which the defence wanted to contradict him, then the Courtcannot suo motu make use of statements to police not proved in compliancew/s.145, Evidence Act – Therefore, it is of utmost importance to proveall major contradictions in the form of material omissions in accordancewith the procedure as established u/s.145, Evidence Act and bring them onrecord – It is the duty of the defence counsel to do so . [Paras 41 and 50]Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 – Chapter XXVIII- ss.366-371; Chapter XXIX- ss.372-394 – Role and duty of High Court inconfi rmation cases:Held: Power to acquit the person can be exercised by the High Courteven without there being any substantive appeal on the part of the accusedchallenging his conviction – To that extent, the proceedings under ChapterXXVIII which deal with “submission of death sentences for confirmation” is a proceeding in continuation of the trial – ss.367, 368 entitle the HighCourt to direct further enquiry or to take additional evidence and the HighCourt may, in a given case, even acquit the accused person – Scope ofthe chapter is wider – Chapter XXIX deals with “Appeals” – s.391 alsoentitles the appellate court to take further evidence or direct such furtherevidence to be taken – s.386 then enumerates powers of the appellate courtwhich inter alia includes the power to “reverse the fi nding and sentenceand acquit or discharge the accused, or order him to be re-tried by a courtof competent jurisdiction subordinate to such appellate court or committedfor trial” – Powers of the appellate court are equally wide – The High Courtin the present case was exercising powers both u/Chapters XXVIII andXXIX, CrPC – ss.367, 368 make it clear that the duty of the High Court, indealing with the reference, is not only to see whether the order passed bythe Sessions Judge is correct, but to examine the case for itself and evendirect a further enquiry or the taking of additional evidence if considereddesirable in order to ascertain the guilt or the innocence of the convictedperson. [Paras 58 and 59]Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 – ss.367, 368 and proviso thereto– Duty of High Court u/s.367:Held: Under the proviso to s.368, no order of confi rmation is to bemade until the period allowed for preferring the appeal has expired, or, ifan appeal is presented within such period, until such appeal is disposedof, so that, if an appeal is fi led by a condemned prisoner, that appeal hasto be disposed of before any order is made in the reference confi rming thesentence of death – In disposing of such an appeal, however, it is necessarythat the High Court should keep in view its duty u/s.367 – It must examinethe appeal record for itself, arrive at a view whether a further enquiryor taking of additional evidence is desirable or not, and then come to itsown conclusion on the entire material on record whether conviction ofthe condemned prisoner is justifi ed and the sentence of death should beconfi rmed. [Para 59]Criminal Law – Criminal justice system – Accusatorial/adversarialsystem:Held: For the dispensation of criminal justice, India follows theaccusatorial or adversarial system of common law – In the accusatorial or adversarial system, the accused is presumed to be innocent; prosecution anddefence each put their case; judge acts as an impartial umpire and whileacting as a neutral umpire sees whether the prosecution has been able toprove its case beyond reasonable doubt or not. [Para 66]Constitution of India – Article 21 – Free and fair trial, a sine-quanon:Held: Free and fair trial is sine-qua-non of Article 21 – If the criminaltrial is not free and fair, then the confi dence of the public in the judicialfairness of a judge and the justice delivery system would be shaken – Denialto fair trial is as much injustice to the accused as to the victim and the society– No trial can be treated as a fair trial unless there is an impartial judgeconducting the trial, an honest, able and fair defence counsel and equallyhonest, able and fair public prosecutor – A fair trial necessarily includes fairand proper opportunity to the prosecutor to prove the guilt of the accusedand opportunity to the accused to prove his innocence.

Trained teacher – They are trained toteach classes at higher level, post primary, secondary and above – For Primarylevel i.e. class I to class V the training is D.El.Ed-Diploma in elementaryeducation – Thus, by implication the inclusion of B.Ed. as a qualifi cationamounts to lowering down of the ‘quality’ of education at Primary level –Need for ‘quality’ and meaningful primary education has been emphasized bythe legislature as well as by the academic authority – In primary education,any compromise on ‘quality’ of education would mean going against the verymandate of Article 21A and the RTE Act – Thus, the decision of the NCTE toinclude B.Ed. as a qualifi cation for teachers in a primary school is arbitrary,unreasonable and has no nexus with the object sought to be achieved by theAct – NCTE had so far consciously kept B.Ed.

[Paras 29, 39 and 40]Telangana Prevention of Dangerous Activities of Bootleggers,Dacoits, Drug-Off enders, Goondas, Immoral Traffi c Off enders, LandGrabbers, Spurious Seed Off enders, Insecticide Off enders, FertiliserOff enders, Food Adulteration Off enders, Fake Document Off enders,Scheduled Commodities Offenders, Forest Offenders, GamingOff enders, Sexual Off enders, Explosive Substances Off enders, ArmsOff enders, Cyber Crime Off enders and White Collar or FinancialOff enders Act 1986 – Application of mind in the order of detentiondated 24.03.2023 – Proper or not:Held: The Detenu was earlier preventively detained under the Actvide order of detention dated 04.03.2021, since quashed by the High Courtby its order dated 16.08.2021 – The Commissioner stated that the presentorder of detention is based only on 5 (fi ve) out of these 9 (nine) crimes(years 2022-2023), which are alleged to show that the Detenu’s activitiesare “prejudicial to the maintenance of public order, apart from disturbingpeace and tranquillity in the area” – The Commissioner sought to projectthat he ordered detention based on the said 5 (fi ve) FIRs, indication ofthe past off ences allegedly committed by the Detenu – However, with the quashing of the order of detention dated 04.03.2021 by the High Court andsuch direction having attained fi nality, it defi es logic why the Commissionerembarked on an elaborate narration of past off ences, which are not relevantto the grounds of the present order of detention – Since the aforesaid orderof the High Court went unchallenged and is, thus, binding upon the parties,it was not open to the Commissioner to refer to the very same antecedentoff ences again in the Detention Order under challenge – There was no directnexus or link with the immediate need to order detention and there wereextraneous considerations in the Detention Order. [Paras 43, 46 and 48]Preventive detention – Ordinary criminal law and extraordinarymeasure of law of preventive detention:Held: In the instant case, it is neither the case of the respondents thatthe Detenu had not complied with the terms of the notice issued u/s. 41-Aof the Cr. PC, nor has it been alleged that the conditions of bail had beenviolated by the Detenu – It is pertinent to note that in the three criminalproceedings where the Detenu had been released on bail, no applications forcancellation of bail had been moved by the State – In the light of the same,the provisions of the Act, which is an extraordinary statute, should not havebeen resorted to when ordinary criminal law provided suffi cient means toaddress the apprehensions leading to the impugned Detention Order – Theremay have existed suffi cient grounds to appeal against the bail orders, butthe circumstances did not warrant the circumvention of ordinary criminalprocedure to resort to an extraordinary measure of the law of preventivedetention. [Para 51]Preventive detention – Guidance for detaining authorities – Orderto be in plain and simple language:Held: There is no requirement in law of orders of detention beingexpressed in language that would normally be considered elegant or artistic– An order of detention, which is capable of comprehension, has to preciselyset forth the grounds of detention without any vagueness – The substance ofthe order and how it is understood by the detenu determines its nature – Anorder in plain and simple language providing clarity of how the subjectivesatisfaction was formed is what a detenu would look for, since the detenuhas a right to represent against the order of detention and claim that suchorder should not have been made at all. [Para 49] Telangana Prevention of Dangerous Activities of Bootleggers,Dacoits, Drug-Off enders, Goondas, Immoral Traffi c Off enders, LandGrabbers, Spurious Seed Off enders, Insecticide Off enders, FertiliserOff enders, Food Adulteration Off enders, Fake Document Off enders,Scheduled Commodities Offenders, Forest Offenders, GamingOff enders, Sexual Off enders, Explosive Substances Off enders, ArmsOff enders, Cyber Crime Off enders and White Collar or FinancialOff enders Act 1986 – Role of the Advisory Board and the Governmentin the period of detention:Held: It is one thing to say that the Advisory Board has expressed anopinion that there is suffi cient cause for the detention and, therefore, thedetention has been continued; yet, it is quite another thing to say that thedetention should continue for the maximum permissible period – In thelight of sub-section (2) of section 11 read with sub-section (1) of section 12of the Act, the period for which the detention should continue is left to bespecifi ed by the Government with the stipulation in section 13 thereof thatthe maximum period shall be 12 (twelve) months from the date of detention– This appears on a plain reading of the relevant statutory provisions – Theduration for which a detenu is to be kept in detention is for the detainingauthority to decide and not the Advisory Board – The period of detention andthe terminal point has, therefore, to be decided by the Government. [Para 58]Telangana Prevention of Dangerous Activities of Bootleggers,Dacoits, Drug-Off enders, Goondas, Immoral Traffi c Off enders, LandGrabbers, Spurious Seed Off enders, Insecticide Off enders, FertiliserOff enders, Food Adulteration Off enders, Fake Document Off enders,Scheduled Commodities Off enders, Forest Off enders, Gaming Off enders,Sexual Off enders, Explosive Substances Off enders, Arms Off enders,Cyber Crime Off enders and White Collar or Financial Off enders Act1986 – The term “maximum period” in s.13 and continuing detention:Held: The very term “maximum period” in section 13 vests theGovernment with discretion, allowing it to be exercised while consideringwhether the detention is to be continued for the maximum period of 12(twelve) months or any lesser period – The period of detention ought tonecessarily vary depending upon the facts and circumstances of each caseand cannot be uniform in all cases – The objective sought to be fulfilled in each case, whether is sub-served by continuing detention for the maximumperiod, ought to bear some refl ection in the order of detention; or else, theGovernment could be accused of unreasonableness and unfairness. [Paras63 and 70]Preventive detention – Judicial reviewability – The Courts totest the legality of orders of preventive detention, when called upon toexamine the same :Held: In the circumstances of a given case, a Constitutional Courtwhen called upon to test the legality of orders of preventive detentionwould be entitled to examine whether: (i) the order is based on the requisitesatisfaction, albeit subjective, of the detaining authority, for, the absence ofsuch satisfaction as to the existence of a matter of fact or law, upon whichvalidity of the exercise of the power is predicated, would be the sine quanon for the exercise of the power not being satisfi ed; (ii) in reaching suchrequisite satisfaction, the detaining authority has applied its mind to allrelevant circumstances and the same is not based on material extraneousto the scope and purpose of the statute; (iii) power has been exercisedfor achieving the purpose for which it has been conferred, or exercisedfor an improper purpose, not authorised by the statute, and is thereforeultra vires; (iv) the detaining authority has acted independently or underthe dictation of another body; (v) the detaining authority, by reason ofself-created rules of policy or in any other manner not authorized by thegoverning statute, has disabled itself from applying its mind to the facts ofeach individual case; (vi) the satisfaction of the detaining authority restson materials which are of rationally probative value, and the detainingauthority has given due regard to the matters as per the statutory mandate;(vii) the satisfaction has been arrived at bearing in mind existence of alive and proximate link between the past conduct of a person and theimperative need to detain him or is based on material which is stale; (viii)the ground(s) for reaching the requisite satisfaction is/are such which anindividual, with some degree of rationality and prudence, would consideras connected with the fact and relevant to the subject-matter of the inquiryin respect whereof the satisfaction is to be reached; (ix) the grounds onwhich the order of preventive detention rests are not vague but are precise,pertinent and relevant which, with sufficient clarity, inform the detenu the satisfaction for the detention, giving him the opportunity to make asuitable representation; and (x) the timelines, as provided under the law,have been strictly adhered to. [Para 25]Constitution of India – Preventive detention – Reckless invocationof:Held: It requires no serious debate that preventive detention, conceivedas an extraordinary measure by the framers of the Constitution, has beenrendered ordinary with its reckless invocation over the years as if it wereavailable for use even in the ordinary course of proceedings – To unchainthe shackles of preventive detention, it is important that the safeguardsenshrined in the Constitution, particularly under the ‘golden triangle’ formedby Articles 14, 19 and 21, are diligently enforced.

        "HeadNote": "Issue for consideration: An order of detention dated 24.03.2023was passed by the Commissioner of Police against appellant’s husband.Whether the alleged acts of commission for which the Detenu has been keptunder detention are prejudicial to ‘public order’ and whether all relevantcircumstances were considered or whether extraneous factors weighed inthe mind of the detaining authority leading to the conclusion that the Detenuis a habitual off ender and for prevention of further crimes by him, he oughtto be detained.Telangana Prevention of Dangerous Activities of Bootleggers,Dacoits, Drug-Off enders, Goondas, Immoral Traffi c Off enders, LandGrabbers, Spurious Seed Off enders, Insecticide Off enders, FertiliserOff enders, Food Adulteration Off enders, Fake Document Off enders,Scheduled Commodities Offenders, Forest Offenders, GamingOff enders, Sexual Off enders, Explosive Substances Off enders, ArmsOff enders, Cyber Crime Off enders and White Collar or FinancialOffenders Act 1986 – During the years 2022 and 2023, in quicksuccession, appellant’s husband had committed 9 (nine) more off encesand 5 (fi ve) FIRs were registered under various sections 186, 189, 353,504, 420, 384, 354, 420, 323, 392, 195A of IPC – An order of detentiondated 24.03.2023 was passed – Propriety:Held: The order of detention impugned failed to differentiate betweenoffences which create a “law and order” situation and which prejudiciallyaffect or tend to prejudicially affect “public order” – Even if the offences referred to in the Detention Order, alleged to have been committed by theDetenu have led to the satisfaction being formed, still the same are separateand stray acts aff ecting private individuals and the repetition of similar suchacts would not tend to aff ect the even fl ow of public life – The off ence inrespect of the minor girl did exercise consideration of the Court for sometime but it was noted that the Detenu was not arrested because of an orderpassed by the High Court on an application u/s. 438 of the Cr.PC. – Evenotherwise, the gravity of the off ences alleged in Arun Ghosh case washigher in degree, yet, the same were not considered as aff ecting ‘publicorder’ – The only other off ence that could attract the enumerated categoryof “acting in any manner prejudicial to the maintenance of public order”and an order of preventive detention, if at all, is the stray incident where theDetenu has been charged u/s. 353, IPC and where the police has not evencontemplated an arrest u/s. 41 of the Cr.PC – On an overall considerationof the circumstances, the existing legal framework for maintaining law andorder is suffi cient to address like off ences under consideration, which theCommissioner anticipates could be repeated by the Detenu if not detained– The order of detention is, thus, indefensible. [Paras 29, 39 and 40]Telangana Prevention of Dangerous Activities of Bootleggers,Dacoits, Drug-Off enders, Goondas, Immoral Traffi c Off enders, LandGrabbers, Spurious Seed Off enders, Insecticide Off enders, FertiliserOff enders, Food Adulteration Off enders, Fake Document Off enders,Scheduled Commodities Offenders, Forest Offenders, GamingOff enders, Sexual Off enders, Explosive Substances Off enders, ArmsOff enders, Cyber Crime Off enders and White Collar or FinancialOff enders Act 1986 – Application of mind in the order of detentiondated 24.03.2023 – Proper or not:Held: The Detenu was earlier preventively detained under the Actvide order of detention dated 04.03.2021, since quashed by the High Courtby its order dated 16.08.2021 – The Commissioner stated that the presentorder of detention is based only on 5 (fi ve) out of these 9 (nine) crimes(years 2022-2023), which are alleged to show that the Detenu’s activitiesare “prejudicial to the maintenance of public order, apart from disturbingpeace and tranquillity in the area” – The Commissioner sought to projectthat he ordered detention based on the said 5 (fi ve) FIRs, indication ofthe past off ences allegedly committed by the Detenu – However, with the quashing of the order of detention dated 04.03.2021 by the High Court andsuch direction having attained fi nality, it defi es logic why the Commissionerembarked on an elaborate narration of past off ences, which are not relevantto the grounds of the present order of detention – Since the aforesaid orderof the High Court went unchallenged and is, thus, binding upon the parties,it was not open to the Commissioner to refer to the very same antecedentoff ences again in the Detention Order under challenge – There was no directnexus or link with the immediate need to order detention and there wereextraneous considerations in the Detention Order. [Paras 43, 46 and 48]Preventive detention – Ordinary criminal law and extraordinarymeasure of law of preventive detention:Held: In the instant case, it is neither the case of the respondents thatthe Detenu had not complied with the terms of the notice issued u/s. 41-Aof the Cr. PC, nor has it been alleged that the conditions of bail had beenviolated by the Detenu – It is pertinent to note that in the three criminalproceedings where the Detenu had been released on bail, no applications forcancellation of bail had been moved by the State – In the light of the same,the provisions of the Act, which is an extraordinary statute, should not havebeen resorted to when ordinary criminal law provided suffi cient means toaddress the apprehensions leading to the impugned Detention Order – Theremay have existed suffi cient grounds to appeal against the bail orders, butthe circumstances did not warrant the circumvention of ordinary criminalprocedure to resort to an extraordinary measure of the law of preventivedetention. [Para 51]Preventive detention – Guidance for detaining authorities – Orderto be in plain and simple language:Held: There is no requirement in law of orders of detention beingexpressed in language that would normally be considered elegant or artistic– An order of detention, which is capable of comprehension, has to preciselyset forth the grounds of detention without any vagueness – The substance ofthe order and how it is understood by the detenu determines its nature – Anorder in plain and simple language providing clarity of how the subjectivesatisfaction was formed is what a detenu would look for, since the detenuhas a right to represent against the order of detention and claim that suchorder should not have been made at all. [Para 49] Telangana Prevention of Dangerous Activities of Bootleggers,Dacoits, Drug-Off enders, Goondas, Immoral Traffi c Off enders, LandGrabbers, Spurious Seed Off enders, Insecticide Off enders, FertiliserOff enders, Food Adulteration Off enders, Fake Document Off enders,Scheduled Commodities Offenders, Forest Offenders, GamingOff enders, Sexual Off enders, Explosive Substances Off enders, ArmsOff enders, Cyber Crime Off enders and White Collar or FinancialOff enders Act 1986 – Role of the Advisory Board and the Governmentin the period of detention:Held: It is one thing to say that the Advisory Board has expressed anopinion that there is suffi cient cause for the detention and, therefore, thedetention has been continued; yet, it is quite another thing to say that thedetention should continue for the maximum permissible period – In thelight of sub-section (2) of section 11 read with sub-section (1) of section 12of the Act, the period for which the detention should continue is left to bespecifi ed by the Government with the stipulation in section 13 thereof thatthe maximum period shall be 12 (twelve) months from the date of detention– This appears on a plain reading of the relevant statutory provisions – Theduration for which a detenu is to be kept in detention is for the detainingauthority to decide and not the Advisory Board – The period of detention andthe terminal point has, therefore, to be decided by the Government. [Para 58]Telangana Prevention of Dangerous Activities of Bootleggers,Dacoits, Drug-Off enders, Goondas, Immoral Traffi c Off enders, LandGrabbers, Spurious Seed Off enders, Insecticide Off enders, FertiliserOff enders, Food Adulteration Off enders, Fake Document Off enders,Scheduled Commodities Off enders, Forest Off enders, Gaming Off enders,Sexual Off enders, Explosive Substances Off enders, Arms Off enders,Cyber Crime Off enders and White Collar or Financial Off enders Act1986 – The term “maximum period” in s.13 and continuing detention:Held: The very term “maximum period” in section 13 vests theGovernment with discretion, allowing it to be exercised while consideringwhether the detention is to be continued for the maximum period of 12(twelve) months or any lesser period – The period of detention ought tonecessarily vary depending upon the facts and circumstances of each caseand cannot be uniform in all cases – The objective sought to be fulfilled in each case, whether is sub-served by continuing detention for the maximumperiod, ought to bear some refl ection in the order of detention; or else, theGovernment could be accused of unreasonableness and unfairness. [Paras63 and 70]Preventive detention – Judicial reviewability – The Courts totest the legality of orders of preventive detention, when called upon toexamine the same :Held: In the circumstances of a given case, a Constitutional Courtwhen called upon to test the legality of orders of preventive detentionwould be entitled to examine whether: (i) the order is based on the requisitesatisfaction, albeit subjective, of the detaining authority, for, the absence ofsuch satisfaction as to the existence of a matter of fact or law, upon whichvalidity of the exercise of the power is predicated, would be the sine quanon for the exercise of the power not being satisfi ed; (ii) in reaching suchrequisite satisfaction, the detaining authority has applied its mind to allrelevant circumstances and the same is not based on material extraneousto the scope and purpose of the statute; (iii) power has been exercisedfor achieving the purpose for which it has been conferred, or exercisedfor an improper purpose, not authorised by the statute, and is thereforeultra vires; (iv) the detaining authority has acted independently or underthe dictation of another body; (v) the detaining authority, by reason ofself-created rules of policy or in any other manner not authorized by thegoverning statute, has disabled itself from applying its mind to the facts ofeach individual case; (vi) the satisfaction of the detaining authority restson materials which are of rationally probative value, and the detainingauthority has given due regard to the matters as per the statutory mandate;(vii) the satisfaction has been arrived at bearing in mind existence of alive and proximate link between the past conduct of a person and theimperative need to detain him or is based on material which is stale; (viii)the ground(s) for reaching the requisite satisfaction is/are such which anindividual, with some degree of rationality and prudence, would consideras connected with the fact and relevant to the subject-matter of the inquiryin respect whereof the satisfaction is to be reached; (ix) the grounds onwhich the order of preventive detention rests are not vague but are precise,pertinent and relevant which, with sufficient clarity, inform the detenu the satisfaction for the detention, giving him the opportunity to make asuitable representation; and (x) the timelines, as provided under the law,have been strictly adhered to. [Para 25]Constitution of India – Preventive detention – Reckless invocationof:Held: It requires no serious debate that preventive detention, conceivedas an extraordinary measure by the framers of the Constitution, has beenrendered ordinary with its reckless invocation over the years as if it wereavailable for use even in the ordinary course of proceedings – To unchainthe shackles of preventive detention, it is important that the safeguardsenshrined in the Constitution, particularly under the ‘golden triangle’ formedby Articles 14, 19 and 21, are diligently enforced.

        "HeadNote": "Issue for consideration: An order of detention dated 24.03.2023was passed by the Commissioner of Police against appellant’s husband.Whether the alleged acts of commission for which the Detenu has been keptunder detention are prejudicial to ‘public order’ and whether all relevantcircumstances were considered or whether extraneous factors weighed inthe mind of the detaining authority leading to the conclusion that the Detenuis a habitual off ender and for prevention of further crimes by him, he oughtto be detained.Telangana Prevention of Dangerous Activities of Bootleggers,Dacoits, Drug-Off enders, Goondas, Immoral Traffi c Off enders, LandGrabbers, Spurious Seed Off enders, Insecticide Off enders, FertiliserOff enders, Food Adulteration Off enders, Fake Document Off enders,Scheduled Commodities Offenders, Forest Offenders, GamingOff enders, Sexual Off enders, Explosive Substances Off enders, ArmsOff enders, Cyber Crime Off enders and White Collar or FinancialOffenders Act 1986 – During the years 2022 and 2023, in quicksuccession, appellant’s husband had committed 9 (nine) more off encesand 5 (fi ve) FIRs were registered under various sections 186, 189, 353,504, 420, 384, 354, 420, 323, 392, 195A of IPC – An order of detentiondated 24.03.2023 was passed – Propriety:Held: The order of detention impugned failed to differentiate betweenoffences which create a “law and order” situation and which prejudiciallyaffect or tend to prejudicially affect “public order” – Even if the offences referred to in the Detention Order, alleged to have been committed by theDetenu have led to the satisfaction being formed, still the same are separateand stray acts aff ecting private individuals and the repetition of similar suchacts would not tend to aff ect the even fl ow of public life – The off ence inrespect of the minor girl did exercise consideration of the Court for sometime but it was noted that the Detenu was not arrested because of an orderpassed by the High Court on an application u/s. 438 of the Cr.PC. – Evenotherwise, the gravity of the off ences alleged in Arun Ghosh case washigher in degree, yet, the same were not considered as aff ecting ‘publicorder’ – The only other off ence that could attract the enumerated categoryof “acting in any manner prejudicial to the maintenance of public order”and an order of preventive detention, if at all, is the stray incident where theDetenu has been charged u/s. 353, IPC and where the police has not evencontemplated an arrest u/s. 41 of the Cr.PC – On an overall considerationof the circumstances, the existing legal framework for maintaining law andorder is suffi cient to address like off ences under consideration, which theCommissioner anticipates could be repeated by the Detenu if not detained– The order of detention is, thus, indefensible. [Paras 29, 39 and 40]Telangana Prevention of Dangerous Activities of Bootleggers,Dacoits, Drug-Off enders, Goondas, Immoral Traffi c Off enders, LandGrabbers, Spurious Seed Off enders, Insecticide Off enders, FertiliserOff enders, Food Adulteration Off enders, Fake Document Off enders,Scheduled Commodities Offenders, Forest Offenders, GamingOff enders, Sexual Off enders, Explosive Substances Off enders, ArmsOff enders, Cyber Crime Off enders and White Collar or FinancialOff enders Act 1986 – Application of mind in the order of detentiondated 24.03.2023 – Proper or not:Held: The Detenu was earlier preventively detained under the Actvide order of detention dated 04.03.2021, since quashed by the High Courtby its order dated 16.08.2021 – The Commissioner stated that the presentorder of detention is based only on 5 (fi ve) out of these 9 (nine) crimes(years 2022-2023), which are alleged to show that the Detenu’s activitiesare “prejudicial to the maintenance of public order, apart from disturbingpeace and tranquillity in the area” – The Commissioner sought to projectthat he ordered detention based on the said 5 (fi ve) FIRs, indication ofthe past off ences allegedly committed by the Detenu – However, with the quashing of the order of detention dated 04.03.2021 by the High Court andsuch direction having attained fi nality, it defi es logic why the Commissionerembarked on an elaborate narration of past off ences, which are not relevantto the grounds of the present order of detention – Since the aforesaid orderof the High Court went unchallenged and is, thus, binding upon the parties,it was not open to the Commissioner to refer to the very same antecedentoff ences again in the Detention Order under challenge – There was no directnexus or link with the immediate need to order detention and there wereextraneous considerations in the Detention Order. [Paras 43, 46 and 48]Preventive detention – Ordinary criminal law and extraordinarymeasure of law of preventive detention:Held: In the instant case, it is neither the case of the respondents thatthe Detenu had not complied with the terms of the notice issued u/s. 41-Aof the Cr. PC, nor has it been alleged that the conditions of bail had beenviolated by the Detenu – It is pertinent to note that in the three criminalproceedings where the Detenu had been released on bail, no applications forcancellation of bail had been moved by the State – In the light of the same,the provisions of the Act, which is an extraordinary statute, should not havebeen resorted to when ordinary criminal law provided suffi cient means toaddress the apprehensions leading to the impugned Detention Order – Theremay have existed suffi cient grounds to appeal against the bail orders, butthe circumstances did not warrant the circumvention of ordinary criminalprocedure to resort to an extraordinary measure of the law of preventivedetention. [Para 51]Preventive detention – Guidance for detaining authorities – Orderto be in plain and simple language:Held: There is no requirement in law of orders of detention beingexpressed in language that would normally be considered elegant or artistic– An order of detention, which is capable of comprehension, has to preciselyset forth the grounds of detention without any vagueness – The substance ofthe order and how it is understood by the detenu determines its nature – Anorder in plain and simple language providing clarity of how the subjectivesatisfaction was formed is what a detenu would look for, since the detenuhas a right to represent against the order of detention and claim that suchorder should not have been made at all. [Para 49] Telangana Prevention of Dangerous Activities of Bootleggers,Dacoits, Drug-Off enders, Goondas, Immoral Traffi c Off enders, LandGrabbers, Spurious Seed Off enders, Insecticide Off enders, FertiliserOff enders, Food Adulteration Off enders, Fake Document Off enders,Scheduled Commodities Offenders, Forest Offenders, GamingOff enders, Sexual Off enders, Explosive Substances Off enders, ArmsOff enders, Cyber Crime Off enders and White Collar or FinancialOff enders Act 1986 – Role of the Advisory Board and the Governmentin the period of detention:Held: It is one thing to say that the Advisory Board has expressed anopinion that there is suffi cient cause for the detention and, therefore, thedetention has been continued; yet, it is quite another thing to say that thedetention should continue for the maximum permissible period – In thelight of sub-section (2) of section 11 read with sub-section (1) of section 12of the Act, the period for which the detention should continue is left to bespecifi ed by the Government with the stipulation in section 13 thereof thatthe maximum period shall be 12 (twelve) months from the date of detention– This appears on a plain reading of the relevant statutory provisions – Theduration for which a detenu is to be kept in detention is for the detainingauthority to decide and not the Advisory Board – The period of detention andthe terminal point has, therefore, to be decided by the Government. [Para 58]Telangana Prevention of Dangerous Activities of Bootleggers,Dacoits, Drug-Off enders, Goondas, Immoral Traffi c Off enders, LandGrabbers, Spurious Seed Off enders, Insecticide Off enders, FertiliserOff enders, Food Adulteration Off enders, Fake Document Off enders,Scheduled Commodities Off enders, Forest Off enders, Gaming Off enders,Sexual Off enders, Explosive Substances Off enders, Arms Off enders,Cyber Crime Off enders and White Collar or Financial Off enders Act1986 – The term “maximum period” in s.13 and continuing detention:Held: The very term “maximum period” in section 13 vests theGovernment with discretion, allowing it to be exercised while consideringwhether the detention is to be continued for the maximum period of 12(twelve) months or any lesser period – The period of detention ought tonecessarily vary depending upon the facts and circumstances of each caseand cannot be uniform in all cases – The objective sought to be fulfilled in each case, whether is sub-served by continuing detention for the maximumperiod, ought to bear some refl ection in the order of detention; or else, theGovernment could be accused of unreasonableness and unfairness. [Paras63 and 70]Preventive detention – Judicial reviewability – The Courts totest the legality of orders of preventive detention, when called upon toexamine the same :Held: In the circumstances of a given case, a Constitutional Courtwhen called upon to test the legality of orders of preventive detentionwould be entitled to examine whether: (i) the order is based on the requisitesatisfaction, albeit subjective, of the detaining authority, for, the absence ofsuch satisfaction as to the existence of a matter of fact or law, upon whichvalidity of the exercise of the power is predicated, would be the sine quanon for the exercise of the power not being satisfi ed; (ii) in reaching suchrequisite satisfaction, the detaining authority has applied its mind to allrelevant circumstances and the same is not based on material extraneousto the scope and purpose of the statute; (iii) power has been exercisedfor achieving the purpose for which it has been conferred, or exercisedfor an improper purpose, not authorised by the statute, and is thereforeultra vires; (iv) the detaining authority has acted independently or underthe dictation of another body; (v) the detaining authority, by reason ofself-created rules of policy or in any other manner not authorized by thegoverning statute, has disabled itself from applying its mind to the facts ofeach individual case; (vi) the satisfaction of the detaining authority restson materials which are of rationally probative value, and the detainingauthority has given due regard to the matters as per the statutory mandate;(vii) the satisfaction has been arrived at bearing in mind existence of alive and proximate link between the past conduct of a person and theimperative need to detain him or is based on material which is stale; (viii)the ground(s) for reaching the requisite satisfaction is/are such which anindividual, with some degree of rationality and prudence, would consideras connected with the fact and relevant to the subject-matter of the inquiryin respect whereof the satisfaction is to be reached; (ix) the grounds onwhich the order of preventive detention rests are not vague but are precise,pertinent and relevant which, with sufficient clarity, inform the detenu the satisfaction for the detention, giving him the opportunity to make asuitable representation; and (x) the timelines, as provided under the law,have been strictly adhered to. [Para 25]Constitution of India – Preventive detention – Reckless invocationof:Held: It requires no serious debate that preventive detention, conceivedas an extraordinary measure by the framers of the Constitution, has beenrendered ordinary with its reckless invocation over the years as if it wereavailable for use even in the ordinary course of proceedings – To unchainthe shackles of preventive detention, it is important that the safeguardsenshrined in the Constitution, particularly under the ‘golden triangle’ formedby Articles 14, 19 and 21, are diligently enforced.

        "HeadNote": "Issue for consideration: An order of detention dated 24.03.2023was passed by the Commissioner of Police against appellant’s husband.Whether the alleged acts of commission for which the Detenu has been keptunder detention are prejudicial to ‘public order’ and whether all relevantcircumstances were considered or whether extraneous factors weighed inthe mind of the detaining authority leading to the conclusion that the Detenuis a habitual off ender and for prevention of further crimes by him, he oughtto be detained.Telangana Prevention of Dangerous Activities of Bootleggers,Dacoits, Drug-Off enders, Goondas, Immoral Traffi c Off enders, LandGrabbers, Spurious Seed Off enders, Insecticide Off enders, FertiliserOff enders, Food Adulteration Off enders, Fake Document Off enders,Scheduled Commodities Offenders, Forest Offenders, GamingOff enders, Sexual Off enders, Explosive Substances Off enders, ArmsOff enders, Cyber Crime Off enders and White Collar or FinancialOffenders Act 1986 – During the years 2022 and 2023, in quicksuccession, appellant’s husband had committed 9 (nine) more off encesand 5 (fi ve) FIRs were registered under various sections 186, 189, 353,504, 420, 384, 354, 420, 323, 392, 195A of IPC – An order of detentiondated 24.03.2023 was passed – Propriety:Held: The order of detention impugned failed to differentiate betweenoffences which create a “law and order” situation and which prejudiciallyaffect or tend to prejudicially affect “public order” – Even if the offences referred to in the Detention Order, alleged to have been committed by theDetenu have led to the satisfaction being formed, still the same are separateand stray acts aff ecting private individuals and the repetition of similar suchacts would not tend to aff ect the even fl ow of public life – The off ence inrespect of the minor girl did exercise consideration of the Court for sometime but it was noted that the Detenu was not arrested because of an orderpassed by the High Court on an application u/s. 438 of the Cr.PC. – Evenotherwise, the gravity of the off ences alleged in Arun Ghosh case washigher in degree, yet, the same were not considered as aff ecting ‘publicorder’ – The only other off ence that could attract the enumerated categoryof “acting in any manner prejudicial to the maintenance of public order”and an order of preventive detention, if at all, is the stray incident where theDetenu has been charged u/s. 353, IPC and where the police has not evencontemplated an arrest u/s. 41 of the Cr.PC – On an overall considerationof the circumstances, the existing legal framework for maintaining law andorder is suffi cient to address like off ences under consideration, which theCommissioner anticipates could be repeated by the Detenu if not detained– The order of detention is, thus, indefensible. [Paras 29, 39 and 40]Telangana Prevention of Dangerous Activities of Bootleggers,Dacoits, Drug-Off enders, Goondas, Immoral Traffi c Off enders, LandGrabbers, Spurious Seed Off enders, Insecticide Off enders, FertiliserOff enders, Food Adulteration Off enders, Fake Document Off enders,Scheduled Commodities Offenders, Forest Offenders, GamingOff enders, Sexual Off enders, Explosive Substances Off enders, ArmsOff enders, Cyber Crime Off enders and White Collar or FinancialOff enders Act 1986 – Application of mind in the order of detentiondated 24.03.2023 – Proper or not:Held: The Detenu was earlier preventively detained under the Actvide order of detention dated 04.03.2021, since quashed by the High Courtby its order dated 16.08.2021 – The Commissioner stated that the presentorder of detention is based only on 5 (fi ve) out of these 9 (nine) crimes(years 2022-2023), which are alleged to show that the Detenu’s activitiesare “prejudicial to the maintenance of public order, apart from disturbingpeace and tranquillity in the area” – The Commissioner sought to projectthat he ordered detention based on the said 5 (fi ve) FIRs, indication ofthe past off ences allegedly committed by the Detenu – However, with the quashing of the order of detention dated 04.03.2021 by the High Court andsuch direction having attained fi nality, it defi es logic why the Commissionerembarked on an elaborate narration of past off ences, which are not relevantto the grounds of the present order of detention – Since the aforesaid orderof the High Court went unchallenged and is, thus, binding upon the parties,it was not open to the Commissioner to refer to the very same antecedentoff ences again in the Detention Order under challenge – There was no directnexus or link with the immediate need to order detention and there wereextraneous considerations in the Detention Order. [Paras 43, 46 and 48]Preventive detention – Ordinary criminal law and extraordinarymeasure of law of preventive detention:Held: In the instant case, it is neither the case of the respondents thatthe Detenu had not complied with the terms of the notice issued u/s. 41-Aof the Cr. PC, nor has it been alleged that the conditions of bail had beenviolated by the Detenu – It is pertinent to note that in the three criminalproceedings where the Detenu had been released on bail, no applications forcancellation of bail had been moved by the State – In the light of the same,the provisions of the Act, which is an extraordinary statute, should not havebeen resorted to when ordinary criminal law provided suffi cient means toaddress the apprehensions leading to the impugned Detention Order – Theremay have existed suffi cient grounds to appeal against the bail orders, butthe circumstances did not warrant the circumvention of ordinary criminalprocedure to resort to an extraordinary measure of the law of preventivedetention. [Para 51]Preventive detention – Guidance for detaining authorities – Orderto be in plain and simple language:Held: There is no requirement in law of orders of detention beingexpressed in language that would normally be considered elegant or artistic– An order of detention, which is capable of comprehension, has to preciselyset forth the grounds of detention without any vagueness – The substance ofthe order and how it is understood by the detenu determines its nature – Anorder in plain and simple language providing clarity of how the subjectivesatisfaction was formed is what a detenu would look for, since the detenuhas a right to represent against the order of detention and claim that suchorder should not have been made at all.

[Para 58]Telangana Prevention of Dangerous Activities of Bootleggers,Dacoits, Drug-Off enders, Goondas, Immoral Traffi c Off enders, LandGrabbers, Spurious Seed Off enders, Insecticide Off enders, FertiliserOff enders, Food Adulteration Off enders, Fake Document Off enders,Scheduled Commodities Off enders, Forest Off enders, Gaming Off enders,Sexual Off enders, Explosive Substances Off enders, Arms Off enders,Cyber Crime Off enders and White Collar or Financial Off enders Act1986 – The term “maximum period” in s.13 and continuing detention:Held: The very term “maximum period” in section 13 vests theGovernment with discretion, allowing it to be exercised while consideringwhether the detention is to be continued for the maximum period of 12(twelve) months or any lesser period – The period of detention ought tonecessarily vary depending upon the facts and circumstances of each caseand cannot be uniform in all cases – The objective sought to be fulfilled in each case, whether is sub-served by continuing detention for the maximumperiod, ought to bear some refl ection in the order of detention; or else, theGovernment could be accused of unreasonableness and unfairness. [Paras63 and 70]Preventive detention – Judicial reviewability – The Courts totest the legality of orders of preventive detention, when called upon toexamine the same :Held: In the circumstances of a given case, a Constitutional Courtwhen called upon to test the legality of orders of preventive detentionwould be entitled to examine whether: (i) the order is based on the requisitesatisfaction, albeit subjective, of the detaining authority, for, the absence ofsuch satisfaction as to the existence of a matter of fact or law, upon whichvalidity of the exercise of the power is predicated, would be the sine quanon for the exercise of the power not being satisfi ed; (ii) in reaching suchrequisite satisfaction, the detaining authority has applied its mind to allrelevant circumstances and the same is not based on material extraneousto the scope and purpose of the statute; (iii) power has been exercisedfor achieving the purpose for which it has been conferred, or exercisedfor an improper purpose, not authorised by the statute, and is thereforeultra vires; (iv) the detaining authority has acted independently or underthe dictation of another body; (v) the detaining authority, by reason ofself-created rules of policy or in any other manner not authorized by thegoverning statute, has disabled itself from applying its mind to the facts ofeach individual case; (vi) the satisfaction of the detaining authority restson materials which are of rationally probative value, and the detainingauthority has given due regard to the matters as per the statutory mandate;(vii) the satisfaction has been arrived at bearing in mind existence of alive and proximate link between the past conduct of a person and theimperative need to detain him or is based on material which is stale; (viii)the ground(s) for reaching the requisite satisfaction is/are such which anindividual, with some degree of rationality and prudence, would consideras connected with the fact and relevant to the subject-matter of the inquiryin respect whereof the satisfaction is to be reached; (ix) the grounds onwhich the order of preventive detention rests are not vague but are precise,pertinent and relevant which, with sufficient clarity, inform the detenu the satisfaction for the detention, giving him the opportunity to make asuitable representation; and (x) the timelines, as provided under the law,have been strictly adhered to. [Para 25]Constitution of India – Preventive detention – Reckless invocationof:Held: It requires no serious debate that preventive detention, conceivedas an extraordinary measure by the framers of the Constitution, has beenrendered ordinary with its reckless invocation over the years as if it wereavailable for use even in the ordinary course of proceedings – To unchainthe shackles of preventive detention, it is important that the safeguardsenshrined in the Constitution, particularly under the ‘golden triangle’ formedby Articles 14, 19 and 21, are diligently enforced.

[Paras 29, 39 and 40]Telangana Prevention of Dangerous Activities of Bootleggers,Dacoits, Drug-Off enders, Goondas, Immoral Traffi c Off enders, LandGrabbers, Spurious Seed Off enders, Insecticide Off enders, FertiliserOff enders, Food Adulteration Off enders, Fake Document Off enders,Scheduled Commodities Offenders, Forest Offenders, GamingOff enders, Sexual Off enders, Explosive Substances Off enders, ArmsOff enders, Cyber Crime Off enders and White Collar or FinancialOff enders Act 1986 – Application of mind in the order of detentiondated 24.03.2023 – Proper or not:Held: The Detenu was earlier preventively detained under the Actvide order of detention dated 04.03.2021, since quashed by the High Courtby its order dated 16.08.2021 – The Commissioner stated that the presentorder of detention is based only on 5 (fi ve) out of these 9 (nine) crimes(years 2022-2023), which are alleged to show that the Detenu’s activitiesare “prejudicial to the maintenance of public order, apart from disturbingpeace and tranquillity in the area” – The Commissioner sought to projectthat he ordered detention based on the said 5 (fi ve) FIRs, indication ofthe past off ences allegedly committed by the Detenu – However, with the quashing of the order of detention dated 04.03.2021 by the High Court andsuch direction having attained fi nality, it defi es logic why the Commissionerembarked on an elaborate narration of past off ences, which are not relevantto the grounds of the present order of detention – Since the aforesaid orderof the High Court went unchallenged and is, thus, binding upon the parties,it was not open to the Commissioner to refer to the very same antecedentoff ences again in the Detention Order under challenge – There was no directnexus or link with the immediate need to order detention and there wereextraneous considerations in the Detention Order. [Paras 43, 46 and 48]Preventive detention – Ordinary criminal law and extraordinarymeasure of law of preventive detention:Held: In the instant case, it is neither the case of the respondents thatthe Detenu had not complied with the terms of the notice issued u/s. 41-Aof the Cr. PC, nor has it been alleged that the conditions of bail had beenviolated by the Detenu – It is pertinent to note that in the three criminalproceedings where the Detenu had been released on bail, no applications forcancellation of bail had been moved by the State – In the light of the same,the provisions of the Act, which is an extraordinary statute, should not havebeen resorted to when ordinary criminal law provided suffi cient means toaddress the apprehensions leading to the impugned Detention Order – Theremay have existed suffi cient grounds to appeal against the bail orders, butthe circumstances did not warrant the circumvention of ordinary criminalprocedure to resort to an extraordinary measure of the law of preventivedetention. [Para 51]Preventive detention – Guidance for detaining authorities – Orderto be in plain and simple language:Held: There is no requirement in law of orders of detention beingexpressed in language that would normally be considered elegant or artistic– An order of detention, which is capable of comprehension, has to preciselyset forth the grounds of detention without any vagueness – The substance ofthe order and how it is understood by the detenu determines its nature – Anorder in plain and simple language providing clarity of how the subjectivesatisfaction was formed is what a detenu would look for, since the detenuhas a right to represent against the order of detention and claim that suchorder should not have been made at all. [Para 49] Telangana Prevention of Dangerous Activities of Bootleggers,Dacoits, Drug-Off enders, Goondas, Immoral Traffi c Off enders, LandGrabbers, Spurious Seed Off enders, Insecticide Off enders, FertiliserOff enders, Food Adulteration Off enders, Fake Document Off enders,Scheduled Commodities Offenders, Forest Offenders, GamingOff enders, Sexual Off enders, Explosive Substances Off enders, ArmsOff enders, Cyber Crime Off enders and White Collar or FinancialOff enders Act 1986 – Role of the Advisory Board and the Governmentin the period of detention:Held: It is one thing to say that the Advisory Board has expressed anopinion that there is suffi cient cause for the detention and, therefore, thedetention has been continued; yet, it is quite another thing to say that thedetention should continue for the maximum permissible period – In thelight of sub-section (2) of section 11 read with sub-section (1) of section 12of the Act, the period for which the detention should continue is left to bespecifi ed by the Government with the stipulation in section 13 thereof thatthe maximum period shall be 12 (twelve) months from the date of detention– This appears on a plain reading of the relevant statutory provisions – Theduration for which a detenu is to be kept in detention is for the detainingauthority to decide and not the Advisory Board – The period of detention andthe terminal point has, therefore, to be decided by the Government. [Para 58]Telangana Prevention of Dangerous Activities of Bootleggers,Dacoits, Drug-Off enders, Goondas, Immoral Traffi c Off enders, LandGrabbers, Spurious Seed Off enders, Insecticide Off enders, FertiliserOff enders, Food Adulteration Off enders, Fake Document Off enders,Scheduled Commodities Off enders, Forest Off enders, Gaming Off enders,Sexual Off enders, Explosive Substances Off enders, Arms Off enders,Cyber Crime Off enders and White Collar or Financial Off enders Act1986 – The term “maximum period” in s.13 and continuing detention:Held: The very term “maximum period” in section 13 vests theGovernment with discretion, allowing it to be exercised while consideringwhether the detention is to be continued for the maximum period of 12(twelve) months or any lesser period – The period of detention ought tonecessarily vary depending upon the facts and circumstances of each caseand cannot be uniform in all cases – The objective sought to be fulfilled in each case, whether is sub-served by continuing detention for the maximumperiod, ought to bear some refl ection in the order of detention; or else, theGovernment could be accused of unreasonableness and unfairness. [Paras63 and 70]Preventive detention – Judicial reviewability – The Courts totest the legality of orders of preventive detention, when called upon toexamine the same :Held: In the circumstances of a given case, a Constitutional Courtwhen called upon to test the legality of orders of preventive detentionwould be entitled to examine whether: (i) the order is based on the requisitesatisfaction, albeit subjective, of the detaining authority, for, the absence ofsuch satisfaction as to the existence of a matter of fact or law, upon whichvalidity of the exercise of the power is predicated, would be the sine quanon for the exercise of the power not being satisfi ed; (ii) in reaching suchrequisite satisfaction, the detaining authority has applied its mind to allrelevant circumstances and the same is not based on material extraneousto the scope and purpose of the statute; (iii) power has been exercisedfor achieving the purpose for which it has been conferred, or exercisedfor an improper purpose, not authorised by the statute, and is thereforeultra vires; (iv) the detaining authority has acted independently or underthe dictation of another body; (v) the detaining authority, by reason ofself-created rules of policy or in any other manner not authorized by thegoverning statute, has disabled itself from applying its mind to the facts ofeach individual case; (vi) the satisfaction of the detaining authority restson materials which are of rationally probative value, and the detainingauthority has given due regard to the matters as per the statutory mandate;(vii) the satisfaction has been arrived at bearing in mind existence of alive and proximate link between the past conduct of a person and theimperative need to detain him or is based on material which is stale; (viii)the ground(s) for reaching the requisite satisfaction is/are such which anindividual, with some degree of rationality and prudence, would consideras connected with the fact and relevant to the subject-matter of the inquiryin respect whereof the satisfaction is to be reached; (ix) the grounds onwhich the order of preventive detention rests are not vague but are precise,pertinent and relevant which, with sufficient clarity, inform the detenu the satisfaction for the detention, giving him the opportunity to make asuitable representation; and (x) the timelines, as provided under the law,have been strictly adhered to. [Para 25]Constitution of India – Preventive detention – Reckless invocationof:Held: It requires no serious debate that preventive detention, conceivedas an extraordinary measure by the framers of the Constitution, has beenrendered ordinary with its reckless invocation over the years as if it wereavailable for use even in the ordinary course of proceedings – To unchainthe shackles of preventive detention, it is important that the safeguardsenshrined in the Constitution, particularly under the ‘golden triangle’ formedby Articles 14, 19 and 21, are diligently enforced.

[Paras63 and 70]Preventive detention – Judicial reviewability – The Courts totest the legality of orders of preventive detention, when called upon toexamine the same :Held: In the circumstances of a given case, a Constitutional Courtwhen called upon to test the legality of orders of preventive detentionwould be entitled to examine whether: (i) the order is based on the requisitesatisfaction, albeit subjective, of the detaining authority, for, the absence ofsuch satisfaction as to the existence of a matter of fact or law, upon whichvalidity of the exercise of the power is predicated, would be the sine quanon for the exercise of the power not being satisfi ed; (ii) in reaching suchrequisite satisfaction, the detaining authority has applied its mind to allrelevant circumstances and the same is not based on material extraneousto the scope and purpose of the statute; (iii) power has been exercisedfor achieving the purpose for which it has been conferred, or exercisedfor an improper purpose, not authorised by the statute, and is thereforeultra vires; (iv) the detaining authority has acted independently or underthe dictation of another body; (v) the detaining authority, by reason ofself-created rules of policy or in any other manner not authorized by thegoverning statute, has disabled itself from applying its mind to the facts ofeach individual case; (vi) the satisfaction of the detaining authority restson materials which are of rationally probative value, and the detainingauthority has given due regard to the matters as per the statutory mandate;(vii) the satisfaction has been arrived at bearing in mind existence of alive and proximate link between the past conduct of a person and theimperative need to detain him or is based on material which is stale; (viii)the ground(s) for reaching the requisite satisfaction is/are such which anindividual, with some degree of rationality and prudence, would consideras connected with the fact and relevant to the subject-matter of the inquiryin respect whereof the satisfaction is to be reached; (ix) the grounds onwhich the order of preventive detention rests are not vague but are precise,pertinent and relevant which, with sufficient clarity, inform the detenu the satisfaction for the detention, giving him the opportunity to make asuitable representation; and (x) the timelines, as provided under the law,have been strictly adhered to."

[Paras 29, 39 and 40]Telangana Prevention of Dangerous Activities of Bootleggers,Dacoits, Drug-Off enders, Goondas, Immoral Traffi c Off enders, LandGrabbers, Spurious Seed Off enders, Insecticide Off enders, FertiliserOff enders, Food Adulteration Off enders, Fake Document Off enders,Scheduled Commodities Offenders, Forest Offenders, GamingOff enders, Sexual Off enders, Explosive Substances Off enders, ArmsOff enders, Cyber Crime Off enders and White Collar or FinancialOff enders Act 1986 – Application of mind in the order of detentiondated 24.03.2023 – Proper or not:Held: The Detenu was earlier preventively detained under the Actvide order of detention dated 04.03.2021, since quashed by the High Courtby its order dated 16.08.2021 – The Commissioner stated that the presentorder of detention is based only on 5 (fi ve) out of these 9 (nine) crimes(years 2022-2023), which are alleged to show that the Detenu’s activitiesare “prejudicial to the maintenance of public order, apart from disturbingpeace and tranquillity in the area” – The Commissioner sought to projectthat he ordered detention based on the said 5 (fi ve) FIRs, indication ofthe past off ences allegedly committed by the Detenu – However, with the quashing of the order of detention dated 04.03.2021 by the High Court andsuch direction having attained fi nality, it defi es logic why the Commissionerembarked on an elaborate narration of past off ences, which are not relevantto the grounds of the present order of detention – Since the aforesaid orderof the High Court went unchallenged and is, thus, binding upon the parties,it was not open to the Commissioner to refer to the very same antecedentoff ences again in the Detention Order under challenge – There was no directnexus or link with the immediate need to order detention and there wereextraneous considerations in the Detention Order. [Paras 43, 46 and 48]Preventive detention – Ordinary criminal law and extraordinarymeasure of law of preventive detention:Held: In the instant case, it is neither the case of the respondents thatthe Detenu had not complied with the terms of the notice issued u/s. 41-Aof the Cr. PC, nor has it been alleged that the conditions of bail had beenviolated by the Detenu – It is pertinent to note that in the three criminalproceedings where the Detenu had been released on bail, no applications forcancellation of bail had been moved by the State – In the light of the same,the provisions of the Act, which is an extraordinary statute, should not havebeen resorted to when ordinary criminal law provided suffi cient means toaddress the apprehensions leading to the impugned Detention Order – Theremay have existed suffi cient grounds to appeal against the bail orders, butthe circumstances did not warrant the circumvention of ordinary criminalprocedure to resort to an extraordinary measure of the law of preventivedetention. [Para 51]Preventive detention – Guidance for detaining authorities – Orderto be in plain and simple language:Held: There is no requirement in law of orders of detention beingexpressed in language that would normally be considered elegant or artistic– An order of detention, which is capable of comprehension, has to preciselyset forth the grounds of detention without any vagueness – The substance ofthe order and how it is understood by the detenu determines its nature – Anorder in plain and simple language providing clarity of how the subjectivesatisfaction was formed is what a detenu would look for, since the detenuhas a right to represent against the order of detention and claim that suchorder should not have been made at all. [Para 49] Telangana Prevention of Dangerous Activities of Bootleggers,Dacoits, Drug-Off enders, Goondas, Immoral Traffi c Off enders, LandGrabbers, Spurious Seed Off enders, Insecticide Off enders, FertiliserOff enders, Food Adulteration Off enders, Fake Document Off enders,Scheduled Commodities Offenders, Forest Offenders, GamingOff enders, Sexual Off enders, Explosive Substances Off enders, ArmsOff enders, Cyber Crime Off enders and White Collar or FinancialOff enders Act 1986 – Role of the Advisory Board and the Governmentin the period of detention:Held: It is one thing to say that the Advisory Board has expressed anopinion that there is suffi cient cause for the detention and, therefore, thedetention has been continued; yet, it is quite another thing to say that thedetention should continue for the maximum permissible period – In thelight of sub-section (2) of section 11 read with sub-section (1) of section 12of the Act, the period for which the detention should continue is left to bespecifi ed by the Government with the stipulation in section 13 thereof thatthe maximum period shall be 12 (twelve) months from the date of detention– This appears on a plain reading of the relevant statutory provisions – Theduration for which a detenu is to be kept in detention is for the detainingauthority to decide and not the Advisory Board – The period of detention andthe terminal point has, therefore, to be decided by the Government. [Para 58]Telangana Prevention of Dangerous Activities of Bootleggers,Dacoits, Drug-Off enders, Goondas, Immoral Traffi c Off enders, LandGrabbers, Spurious Seed Off enders, Insecticide Off enders, FertiliserOff enders, Food Adulteration Off enders, Fake Document Off enders,Scheduled Commodities Off enders, Forest Off enders, Gaming Off enders,Sexual Off enders, Explosive Substances Off enders, Arms Off enders,Cyber Crime Off enders and White Collar or Financial Off enders Act1986 – The term “maximum period” in s.13 and continuing detention:Held: The very term “maximum period” in section 13 vests theGovernment with discretion, allowing it to be exercised while consideringwhether the detention is to be continued for the maximum period of 12(twelve) months or any lesser period – The period of detention ought tonecessarily vary depending upon the facts and circumstances of each caseand cannot be uniform in all cases – The objective sought to be fulfilled in each case, whether is sub-served by continuing detention for the maximumperiod, ought to bear some refl ection in the order of detention; or else, theGovernment could be accused of unreasonableness and unfairness. [Paras63 and 70]Preventive detention – Judicial reviewability – The Courts totest the legality of orders of preventive detention, when called upon toexamine the same :Held: In the circumstances of a given case, a Constitutional Courtwhen called upon to test the legality of orders of preventive detentionwould be entitled to examine whether: (i) the order is based on the requisitesatisfaction, albeit subjective, of the detaining authority, for, the absence ofsuch satisfaction as to the existence of a matter of fact or law, upon whichvalidity of the exercise of the power is predicated, would be the sine quanon for the exercise of the power not being satisfi ed; (ii) in reaching suchrequisite satisfaction, the detaining authority has applied its mind to allrelevant circumstances and the same is not based on material extraneousto the scope and purpose of the statute; (iii) power has been exercisedfor achieving the purpose for which it has been conferred, or exercisedfor an improper purpose, not authorised by the statute, and is thereforeultra vires; (iv) the detaining authority has acted independently or underthe dictation of another body; (v) the detaining authority, by reason ofself-created rules of policy or in any other manner not authorized by thegoverning statute, has disabled itself from applying its mind to the facts ofeach individual case; (vi) the satisfaction of the detaining authority restson materials which are of rationally probative value, and the detainingauthority has given due regard to the matters as per the statutory mandate;(vii) the satisfaction has been arrived at bearing in mind existence of alive and proximate link between the past conduct of a person and theimperative need to detain him or is based on material which is stale; (viii)the ground(s) for reaching the requisite satisfaction is/are such which anindividual, with some degree of rationality and prudence, would consideras connected with the fact and relevant to the subject-matter of the inquiryin respect whereof the satisfaction is to be reached; (ix) the grounds onwhich the order of preventive detention rests are not vague but are precise,pertinent and relevant which, with sufficient clarity, inform the detenu the satisfaction for the detention, giving him the opportunity to make asuitable representation; and (x) the timelines, as provided under the law,have been strictly adhered to. [Para 25]Constitution of India – Preventive detention – Reckless invocationof:Held: It requires no serious debate that preventive detention, conceivedas an extraordinary measure by the framers of the Constitution, has beenrendered ordinary with its reckless invocation over the years as if it wereavailable for use even in the ordinary course of proceedings – To unchainthe shackles of preventive detention, it is important that the safeguardsenshrined in the Constitution, particularly under the ‘golden triangle’ formedby Articles 14, 19 and 21, are diligently enforced.

To put it in other words, can an accuseddecline to subject himself to the TIP on the ground that the same violateshis fundamental right under Article 20(3) of the Constitution?;(iv) To what extent the Court can draw an adverse inference againstthe accused for having refused to participate in the TIP? Whether by virtueof drawing such adverse inference, is it open for the Court to accept thesubstantive evidence of identifi cation before the Trial Court without anycorroboration to such identifi cation?;(v) What is the true purport of Section 54A of the CrPC?; (vi) Whether the Courts below were justifi ed in placing reliance on thediscovery of weapon of off ence and the currency notes from the residenceof the appellant convict as one of the incriminating circumstances againstthe appellant convict?Test Identifi cation Parade – Whether an accused can decline toparticipate in the TIP on the ground that he was already shown to theeye witnesses prior to the conduct of the TIP:Held: The accused while subjecting himself to the TIP does notproduce any evidence or perform any evidentiary act – It may be a positiveact and even a volitional act, but only to a limited extent, when the accusedis brought to the place where the TIP is to be held – It is certainly not hisevidentiary act – The accused concerned may have a legitimate ground toresist facing the TIP saying that the witnesses had a chance to see him eitherat the police station or in the Court, as the case may be, however, on suchground alone he cannot refuse to face the TIP – It is always open for theaccused to raise any legal ground available to him relating to the legitimacyof the TIP or the evidentiary value of the same in the course of the trial –However, the accused cannot decline or refuse to join the TIP. [Para 35]Test Identifi cation Parade – Whether TIP violates the fundamentalright of an accused under Article 20(3) of the Constitution.Held: What is prohibited by Article 20(3) of the Constitution isprocuring by compulsion of the positive volitional evidentiary acts of anaccused – It is true that an accused may be said to be compelled to attend atest identifi cation parade, but this compulsion does not involve any positivevolitional evidentiary act – His mere attendance or the exhibition of hisbody at a test identifi cation parade even though compelled, does not resultin any evidentiary act until he is identifi ed by some other agency – Theidentifi cation of him by a witness is not his act, even though his body isexhibited for the purpose – If the coercion is sought to be imposed in gettingfrom an accused evidence which cannot be procured save through positivevolitional act on his part, the constitutional guarantee as enshrined underArticle 20(3) of the Constitution will step in to protect him – However, ifthat evidence can be procured without any positive volitional evidentiaryact on the part of the accused, Article 20(3) of the Constitution will haveno application. [Paras 26 and 35] Test Identifi cation Parade – The test identifi cation parade providescorroboration to the identifi cation of the witness in court:Held: It is well settled that the substantive evidence is the evidenceof identification in court and the test identification parade providescorroboration to the identifi cation of the witness in court, if required –However, what weight must be attached to the evidence of identifi cation incourt, which is not preceded by a test identifi cation parade, is a matter forthe courts of fact to examine. [Para 48]Test Identifi cation Parade – Where an accused himself refused toparticipate in the TIP:Held: In a case where an accused himself refused to participate in theTIP, it is not open to him to contend that the statement of the eye witnessesmade for the fi rst time in Court, wherein they specifi cally point towards himas a person who had taken part in the commission of the crime, should notbe relied upon – Such a plea is available provided the prosecution is itselfresponsible for not holding a TIP – However, in a case where the accusedhimself declines to participate in a TIP, the prosecution has no option but toproceed in a normal manner like all other cases and rely upon the testimonyof the witnesses, which is recorded in Court during the course of the trialof the case. [Para 70]Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 – s.54A – Test Identifi cationParade – Obligation u/s. 54A CrPC:Held: The introduction of Section 54A in the CrPC, an accused isunder an obligation to stand for identifi cation parade – An accused cannotresist subjecting himself to the TIP on the ground that he cannot be forcedor coerced for the same – If the coercion is sought to be imposed in gettingfrom an accused evidence which cannot be procured save through positivevolitional act on his part, the constitutional guarantee as enshrined underArticle 20(3) of the Constitution will step in to protect him – However, ifthat evidence can be procured without any positive volitional evidentiaryact on the part of the accused, Article 20(3) of the Constitution will haveno application – The accused while subjecting himself to the TIP does notproduce any evidence or perform any evidentiary act. [Para 35] Test Identifi cation Parade – Importance and Evidentiary valueof TIP:Held: Facts which establish the identity of any person or thing whoseidentity is relevant are, by virtue of Section 9 of the Evidence Act, alwaysrelevant – The term ‘identifi cation’ means proving that a person, subjector article before the Court is the very same that he or it is alleged, chargedor reputed to be – Identifi cation is almost always a matter of opinion orbelief. [Para 37]Test Identifi cation Parade – Object of:Held: Before the investigating authorities send up a case to Court, theymust be satisfi ed that the persons arrested by them are the persons accusedof having committed the crime – If they were known to the witnesses, thewitnesses would have given their names and that would have established theiridentity, but when they were not known, their identity could be establishedonly if the witnesses on seeing them say that they are the off enders – Sinceit would be very easy for a witness who has little regard for truth, to say thatthe person arrested on suspicion was the off ender, he is confronted with thesuspect mixed with innocent men – If he picks him out, that would add tothe credibility of his statement that he was the off ender – This is the primaryobject of identification proceeding. [Paras 40 and 41]Penal Code, 1860 – Trial Court convicted appellant-convict u/ss. 302, 392, 394, 397 and sentenced him imprisonment for life – HighCourt affirmed the conviction and sentence – Propriety:Held: Appellant-convict stated that the PW-1 was in a position toidentify him for the fi rst time before the Trial Court only because he had theopportunity to see him on 15.09.2008 – In such circumstances, it is arguedon behalf of the appellant convict that there is no evidence to hold him guiltyfor the alleged crime – However, the State stated that is not a suffi cient ora good ground to discard the substantive evidence of identifi cation beforethe Trial Court – Although the appellant convict in his further statementrecorded u/s. 313 CrPC stated that he had refused to participate in the TIPas the eye witnesses had already seen him, yet except a bald assertion, noother foundation was laid for offering such an explanation – It is a longsettled law that if a witness is trustworthy and reliable, the mere fact thatno identifi cation parade could be conducted and the appellant convict was identifi ed for the fi rst time before the Trial Court, would not be a reason todiscard the evidence of the witness – Further, in a case where the accusedhimself declines to participate in a TIP, the prosecution has no option but toproceed in a normal manner like all other cases and rely upon the testimonyof the witnesses, which is recorded in Court during the course of the trial ofthe case – In the instant case, the PW-1 in his fi rst statement had categoricallystated that he can identify assailants, if brought before him and while givingstatements he had identifi ed all four assailants in the Court and their roles inthe crime – Besides that, when the appellant was arrested, he is said to havemade a disclosure statement – The statement was one relating to the weaponof off ence i.e. ice pick which was ultimately discovered from his house – Theevidence of the circumstance, simpliciter, that the accused pointed out tothe police offi cer, the place where he had concealed the weapon of off encei.e. ice pick, would be admissible as conduct u/s. 8 irrespective of the factwhether the statement made by the appellant convict contemporaneouslywith or antecedent to such conduct falls within the purview of s.27 of theEvidence Act or not – There was no infirmity in the line of reasoning adoptedby the Trial Court as well as by the High Court in holding the appellantconvict guilty of the alleged crime.

[Para 35]Test Identifi cation Parade – Whether TIP violates the fundamentalright of an accused under Article 20(3) of the Constitution.Held: What is prohibited by Article 20(3) of the Constitution isprocuring by compulsion of the positive volitional evidentiary acts of anaccused – It is true that an accused may be said to be compelled to attend atest identifi cation parade, but this compulsion does not involve any positivevolitional evidentiary act – His mere attendance or the exhibition of hisbody at a test identifi cation parade even though compelled, does not resultin any evidentiary act until he is identifi ed by some other agency – Theidentifi cation of him by a witness is not his act, even though his body isexhibited for the purpose – If the coercion is sought to be imposed in gettingfrom an accused evidence which cannot be procured save through positivevolitional act on his part, the constitutional guarantee as enshrined underArticle 20(3) of the Constitution will step in to protect him – However, ifthat evidence can be procured without any positive volitional evidentiaryact on the part of the accused, Article 20(3) of the Constitution will haveno application. [Paras 26 and 35] Test Identifi cation Parade – The test identifi cation parade providescorroboration to the identifi cation of the witness in court:Held: It is well settled that the substantive evidence is the evidenceof identification in court and the test identification parade providescorroboration to the identifi cation of the witness in court, if required –However, what weight must be attached to the evidence of identifi cation incourt, which is not preceded by a test identifi cation parade, is a matter forthe courts of fact to examine. [Para 48]Test Identifi cation Parade – Where an accused himself refused toparticipate in the TIP:Held: In a case where an accused himself refused to participate in theTIP, it is not open to him to contend that the statement of the eye witnessesmade for the fi rst time in Court, wherein they specifi cally point towards himas a person who had taken part in the commission of the crime, should notbe relied upon – Such a plea is available provided the prosecution is itselfresponsible for not holding a TIP – However, in a case where the accusedhimself declines to participate in a TIP, the prosecution has no option but toproceed in a normal manner like all other cases and rely upon the testimonyof the witnesses, which is recorded in Court during the course of the trialof the case. [Para 70]Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 – s.54A – Test Identifi cationParade – Obligation u/s. 54A CrPC:Held: The introduction of Section 54A in the CrPC, an accused isunder an obligation to stand for identifi cation parade – An accused cannotresist subjecting himself to the TIP on the ground that he cannot be forcedor coerced for the same – If the coercion is sought to be imposed in gettingfrom an accused evidence which cannot be procured save through positivevolitional act on his part, the constitutional guarantee as enshrined underArticle 20(3) of the Constitution will step in to protect him – However, ifthat evidence can be procured without any positive volitional evidentiaryact on the part of the accused, Article 20(3) of the Constitution will haveno application – The accused while subjecting himself to the TIP does notproduce any evidence or perform any evidentiary act. [Para 35] Test Identifi cation Parade – Importance and Evidentiary valueof TIP:Held: Facts which establish the identity of any person or thing whoseidentity is relevant are, by virtue of Section 9 of the Evidence Act, alwaysrelevant – The term ‘identifi cation’ means proving that a person, subjector article before the Court is the very same that he or it is alleged, chargedor reputed to be – Identifi cation is almost always a matter of opinion orbelief. [Para 37]Test Identifi cation Parade – Object of:Held: Before the investigating authorities send up a case to Court, theymust be satisfi ed that the persons arrested by them are the persons accusedof having committed the crime – If they were known to the witnesses, thewitnesses would have given their names and that would have established theiridentity, but when they were not known, their identity could be establishedonly if the witnesses on seeing them say that they are the off enders – Sinceit would be very easy for a witness who has little regard for truth, to say thatthe person arrested on suspicion was the off ender, he is confronted with thesuspect mixed with innocent men – If he picks him out, that would add tothe credibility of his statement that he was the off ender – This is the primaryobject of identification proceeding. [Paras 40 and 41]Penal Code, 1860 – Trial Court convicted appellant-convict u/ss. 302, 392, 394, 397 and sentenced him imprisonment for life – HighCourt affirmed the conviction and sentence – Propriety:Held: Appellant-convict stated that the PW-1 was in a position toidentify him for the fi rst time before the Trial Court only because he had theopportunity to see him on 15.09.2008 – In such circumstances, it is arguedon behalf of the appellant convict that there is no evidence to hold him guiltyfor the alleged crime – However, the State stated that is not a suffi cient ora good ground to discard the substantive evidence of identifi cation beforethe Trial Court – Although the appellant convict in his further statementrecorded u/s. 313 CrPC stated that he had refused to participate in the TIPas the eye witnesses had already seen him, yet except a bald assertion, noother foundation was laid for offering such an explanation – It is a longsettled law that if a witness is trustworthy and reliable, the mere fact thatno identifi cation parade could be conducted and the appellant convict was identifi ed for the fi rst time before the Trial Court, would not be a reason todiscard the evidence of the witness – Further, in a case where the accusedhimself declines to participate in a TIP, the prosecution has no option but toproceed in a normal manner like all other cases and rely upon the testimonyof the witnesses, which is recorded in Court during the course of the trial ofthe case – In the instant case, the PW-1 in his fi rst statement had categoricallystated that he can identify assailants, if brought before him and while givingstatements he had identifi ed all four assailants in the Court and their roles inthe crime – Besides that, when the appellant was arrested, he is said to havemade a disclosure statement – The statement was one relating to the weaponof off ence i.e. ice pick which was ultimately discovered from his house – Theevidence of the circumstance, simpliciter, that the accused pointed out tothe police offi cer, the place where he had concealed the weapon of off encei.e. ice pick, would be admissible as conduct u/s. 8 irrespective of the factwhether the statement made by the appellant convict contemporaneouslywith or antecedent to such conduct falls within the purview of s.27 of theEvidence Act or not – There was no infirmity in the line of reasoning adoptedby the Trial Court as well as by the High Court in holding the appellantconvict guilty of the alleged crime.

To put it in other words, can an accuseddecline to subject himself to the TIP on the ground that the same violateshis fundamental right under Article 20(3) of the Constitution?;(iv) To what extent the Court can draw an adverse inference againstthe accused for having refused to participate in the TIP? Whether by virtueof drawing such adverse inference, is it open for the Court to accept thesubstantive evidence of identifi cation before the Trial Court without anycorroboration to such identifi cation?;(v) What is the true purport of Section 54A of the CrPC?; (vi) Whether the Courts below were justifi ed in placing reliance on thediscovery of weapon of off ence and the currency notes from the residenceof the appellant convict as one of the incriminating circumstances againstthe appellant convict?Test Identifi cation Parade – Whether an accused can decline toparticipate in the TIP on the ground that he was already shown to theeye witnesses prior to the conduct of the TIP:Held: The accused while subjecting himself to the TIP does notproduce any evidence or perform any evidentiary act – It may be a positiveact and even a volitional act, but only to a limited extent, when the accusedis brought to the place where the TIP is to be held – It is certainly not hisevidentiary act – The accused concerned may have a legitimate ground toresist facing the TIP saying that the witnesses had a chance to see him eitherat the police station or in the Court, as the case may be, however, on suchground alone he cannot refuse to face the TIP – It is always open for theaccused to raise any legal ground available to him relating to the legitimacyof the TIP or the evidentiary value of the same in the course of the trial –However, the accused cannot decline or refuse to join the TIP. [Para 35]Test Identifi cation Parade – Whether TIP violates the fundamentalright of an accused under Article 20(3) of the Constitution.Held: What is prohibited by Article 20(3) of the Constitution isprocuring by compulsion of the positive volitional evidentiary acts of anaccused – It is true that an accused may be said to be compelled to attend atest identifi cation parade, but this compulsion does not involve any positivevolitional evidentiary act – His mere attendance or the exhibition of hisbody at a test identifi cation parade even though compelled, does not resultin any evidentiary act until he is identifi ed by some other agency – Theidentifi cation of him by a witness is not his act, even though his body isexhibited for the purpose – If the coercion is sought to be imposed in gettingfrom an accused evidence which cannot be procured save through positivevolitional act on his part, the constitutional guarantee as enshrined underArticle 20(3) of the Constitution will step in to protect him – However, ifthat evidence can be procured without any positive volitional evidentiaryact on the part of the accused, Article 20(3) of the Constitution will haveno application. [Paras 26 and 35] Test Identifi cation Parade – The test identifi cation parade providescorroboration to the identifi cation of the witness in court:Held: It is well settled that the substantive evidence is the evidenceof identification in court and the test identification parade providescorroboration to the identifi cation of the witness in court, if required –However, what weight must be attached to the evidence of identifi cation incourt, which is not preceded by a test identifi cation parade, is a matter forthe courts of fact to examine. [Para 48]Test Identifi cation Parade – Where an accused himself refused toparticipate in the TIP:Held: In a case where an accused himself refused to participate in theTIP, it is not open to him to contend that the statement of the eye witnessesmade for the fi rst time in Court, wherein they specifi cally point towards himas a person who had taken part in the commission of the crime, should notbe relied upon – Such a plea is available provided the prosecution is itselfresponsible for not holding a TIP – However, in a case where the accusedhimself declines to participate in a TIP, the prosecution has no option but toproceed in a normal manner like all other cases and rely upon the testimonyof the witnesses, which is recorded in Court during the course of the trialof the case. [Para 70]Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 – s.54A – Test Identifi cationParade – Obligation u/s. 54A CrPC:Held: The introduction of Section 54A in the CrPC, an accused isunder an obligation to stand for identifi cation parade – An accused cannotresist subjecting himself to the TIP on the ground that he cannot be forcedor coerced for the same – If the coercion is sought to be imposed in gettingfrom an accused evidence which cannot be procured save through positivevolitional act on his part, the constitutional guarantee as enshrined underArticle 20(3) of the Constitution will step in to protect him – However, ifthat evidence can be procured without any positive volitional evidentiaryact on the part of the accused, Article 20(3) of the Constitution will haveno application – The accused while subjecting himself to the TIP does notproduce any evidence or perform any evidentiary act. [Para 35] Test Identifi cation Parade – Importance and Evidentiary valueof TIP:Held: Facts which establish the identity of any person or thing whoseidentity is relevant are, by virtue of Section 9 of the Evidence Act, alwaysrelevant – The term ‘identifi cation’ means proving that a person, subjector article before the Court is the very same that he or it is alleged, chargedor reputed to be – Identifi cation is almost always a matter of opinion orbelief. [Para 37]Test Identifi cation Parade – Object of:Held: Before the investigating authorities send up a case to Court, theymust be satisfi ed that the persons arrested by them are the persons accusedof having committed the crime – If they were known to the witnesses, thewitnesses would have given their names and that would have established theiridentity, but when they were not known, their identity could be establishedonly if the witnesses on seeing them say that they are the off enders – Sinceit would be very easy for a witness who has little regard for truth, to say thatthe person arrested on suspicion was the off ender, he is confronted with thesuspect mixed with innocent men – If he picks him out, that would add tothe credibility of his statement that he was the off ender – This is the primaryobject of identification proceeding. [Paras 40 and 41]Penal Code, 1860 – Trial Court convicted appellant-convict u/ss. 302, 392, 394, 397 and sentenced him imprisonment for life – HighCourt affirmed the conviction and sentence – Propriety:Held: Appellant-convict stated that the PW-1 was in a position toidentify him for the fi rst time before the Trial Court only because he had theopportunity to see him on 15.09.2008 – In such circumstances, it is arguedon behalf of the appellant convict that there is no evidence to hold him guiltyfor the alleged crime – However, the State stated that is not a suffi cient ora good ground to discard the substantive evidence of identifi cation beforethe Trial Court – Although the appellant convict in his further statementrecorded u/s. 313 CrPC stated that he had refused to participate in the TIPas the eye witnesses had already seen him, yet except a bald assertion, noother foundation was laid for offering such an explanation – It is a longsettled law that if a witness is trustworthy and reliable, the mere fact thatno identifi cation parade could be conducted and the appellant convict was identifi ed for the fi rst time before the Trial Court, would not be a reason todiscard the evidence of the witness – Further, in a case where the accusedhimself declines to participate in a TIP, the prosecution has no option but toproceed in a normal manner like all other cases and rely upon the testimonyof the witnesses, which is recorded in Court during the course of the trial ofthe case – In the instant case, the PW-1 in his fi rst statement had categoricallystated that he can identify assailants, if brought before him and while givingstatements he had identifi ed all four assailants in the Court and their roles inthe crime – Besides that, when the appellant was arrested, he is said to havemade a disclosure statement – The statement was one relating to the weaponof off ence i.e. ice pick which was ultimately discovered from his house – Theevidence of the circumstance, simpliciter, that the accused pointed out tothe police offi cer, the place where he had concealed the weapon of off encei.e. ice pick, would be admissible as conduct u/s. 8 irrespective of the factwhether the statement made by the appellant convict contemporaneouslywith or antecedent to such conduct falls within the purview of s.27 of theEvidence Act or not – There was no infirmity in the line of reasoning adoptedby the Trial Court as well as by the High Court in holding the appellantconvict guilty of the alleged crime.

[Para 35]Test Identifi cation Parade – Whether TIP violates the fundamentalright of an accused under Article 20(3) of the Constitution.Held: What is prohibited by Article 20(3) of the Constitution isprocuring by compulsion of the positive volitional evidentiary acts of anaccused – It is true that an accused may be said to be compelled to attend atest identifi cation parade, but this compulsion does not involve any positivevolitional evidentiary act – His mere attendance or the exhibition of hisbody at a test identifi cation parade even though compelled, does not resultin any evidentiary act until he is identifi ed by some other agency – Theidentifi cation of him by a witness is not his act, even though his body isexhibited for the purpose – If the coercion is sought to be imposed in gettingfrom an accused evidence which cannot be procured save through positivevolitional act on his part, the constitutional guarantee as enshrined underArticle 20(3) of the Constitution will step in to protect him – However, ifthat evidence can be procured without any positive volitional evidentiaryact on the part of the accused, Article 20(3) of the Constitution will haveno application. [Paras 26 and 35] Test Identifi cation Parade – The test identifi cation parade providescorroboration to the identifi cation of the witness in court:Held: It is well settled that the substantive evidence is the evidenceof identification in court and the test identification parade providescorroboration to the identifi cation of the witness in court, if required –However, what weight must be attached to the evidence of identifi cation incourt, which is not preceded by a test identifi cation parade, is a matter forthe courts of fact to examine. [Para 48]Test Identifi cation Parade – Where an accused himself refused toparticipate in the TIP:Held: In a case where an accused himself refused to participate in theTIP, it is not open to him to contend that the statement of the eye witnessesmade for the fi rst time in Court, wherein they specifi cally point towards himas a person who had taken part in the commission of the crime, should notbe relied upon – Such a plea is available provided the prosecution is itselfresponsible for not holding a TIP – However, in a case where the accusedhimself declines to participate in a TIP, the prosecution has no option but toproceed in a normal manner like all other cases and rely upon the testimonyof the witnesses, which is recorded in Court during the course of the trialof the case. [Para 70]Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 – s.54A – Test Identifi cationParade – Obligation u/s. 54A CrPC:Held: The introduction of Section 54A in the CrPC, an accused isunder an obligation to stand for identifi cation parade – An accused cannotresist subjecting himself to the TIP on the ground that he cannot be forcedor coerced for the same – If the coercion is sought to be imposed in gettingfrom an accused evidence which cannot be procured save through positivevolitional act on his part, the constitutional guarantee as enshrined underArticle 20(3) of the Constitution will step in to protect him – However, ifthat evidence can be procured without any positive volitional evidentiaryact on the part of the accused, Article 20(3) of the Constitution will haveno application – The accused while subjecting himself to the TIP does notproduce any evidence or perform any evidentiary act. [Para 35] Test Identifi cation Parade – Importance and Evidentiary valueof TIP:Held: Facts which establish the identity of any person or thing whoseidentity is relevant are, by virtue of Section 9 of the Evidence Act, alwaysrelevant – The term ‘identifi cation’ means proving that a person, subjector article before the Court is the very same that he or it is alleged, chargedor reputed to be – Identifi cation is almost always a matter of opinion orbelief. [Para 37]Test Identifi cation Parade – Object of:Held: Before the investigating authorities send up a case to Court, theymust be satisfi ed that the persons arrested by them are the persons accusedof having committed the crime – If they were known to the witnesses, thewitnesses would have given their names and that would have established theiridentity, but when they were not known, their identity could be establishedonly if the witnesses on seeing them say that they are the off enders – Sinceit would be very easy for a witness who has little regard for truth, to say thatthe person arrested on suspicion was the off ender, he is confronted with thesuspect mixed with innocent men – If he picks him out, that would add tothe credibility of his statement that he was the off ender – This is the primaryobject of identification proceeding. [Paras 40 and 41]Penal Code, 1860 – Trial Court convicted appellant-convict u/ss. 302, 392, 394, 397 and sentenced him imprisonment for life – HighCourt affirmed the conviction and sentence – Propriety:Held: Appellant-convict stated that the PW-1 was in a position toidentify him for the fi rst time before the Trial Court only because he had theopportunity to see him on 15.09.2008 – In such circumstances, it is arguedon behalf of the appellant convict that there is no evidence to hold him guiltyfor the alleged crime – However, the State stated that is not a suffi cient ora good ground to discard the substantive evidence of identifi cation beforethe Trial Court – Although the appellant convict in his further statementrecorded u/s. 313 CrPC stated that he had refused to participate in the TIPas the eye witnesses had already seen him, yet except a bald assertion, noother foundation was laid for offering such an explanation – It is a longsettled law that if a witness is trustworthy and reliable, the mere fact thatno identifi cation parade could be conducted and the appellant convict was identifi ed for the fi rst time before the Trial Court, would not be a reason todiscard the evidence of the witness – Further, in a case where the accusedhimself declines to participate in a TIP, the prosecution has no option but toproceed in a normal manner like all other cases and rely upon the testimonyof the witnesses, which is recorded in Court during the course of the trial ofthe case – In the instant case, the PW-1 in his fi rst statement had categoricallystated that he can identify assailants, if brought before him and while givingstatements he had identifi ed all four assailants in the Court and their roles inthe crime – Besides that, when the appellant was arrested, he is said to havemade a disclosure statement – The statement was one relating to the weaponof off ence i.e. ice pick which was ultimately discovered from his house – Theevidence of the circumstance, simpliciter, that the accused pointed out tothe police offi cer, the place where he had concealed the weapon of off encei.e. ice pick, would be admissible as conduct u/s. 8 irrespective of the factwhether the statement made by the appellant convict contemporaneouslywith or antecedent to such conduct falls within the purview of s.27 of theEvidence Act or not – There was no infirmity in the line of reasoning adoptedby the Trial Court as well as by the High Court in holding the appellantconvict guilty of the alleged crime.

[Para 35] Test Identifi cation Parade – Importance and Evidentiary valueof TIP:Held: Facts which establish the identity of any person or thing whoseidentity is relevant are, by virtue of Section 9 of the Evidence Act, alwaysrelevant – The term ‘identifi cation’ means proving that a person, subjector article before the Court is the very same that he or it is alleged, chargedor reputed to be – Identifi cation is almost always a matter of opinion orbelief. [Para 37]Test Identifi cation Parade – Object of:Held: Before the investigating authorities send up a case to Court, theymust be satisfi ed that the persons arrested by them are the persons accusedof having committed the crime – If they were known to the witnesses, thewitnesses would have given their names and that would have established theiridentity, but when they were not known, their identity could be establishedonly if the witnesses on seeing them say that they are the off enders – Sinceit would be very easy for a witness who has little regard for truth, to say thatthe person arrested on suspicion was the off ender, he is confronted with thesuspect mixed with innocent men – If he picks him out, that would add tothe credibility of his statement that he was the off ender – This is the primaryobject of identification proceeding. [Paras 40 and 41]Penal Code, 1860 – Trial Court convicted appellant-convict u/ss. 302, 392, 394, 397 and sentenced him imprisonment for life – HighCourt affirmed the conviction and sentence – Propriety:Held: Appellant-convict stated that the PW-1 was in a position toidentify him for the fi rst time before the Trial Court only because he had theopportunity to see him on 15.09.2008 – In such circumstances, it is arguedon behalf of the appellant convict that there is no evidence to hold him guiltyfor the alleged crime – However, the State stated that is not a suffi cient ora good ground to discard the substantive evidence of identifi cation beforethe Trial Court – Although the appellant convict in his further statementrecorded u/s. 313 CrPC stated that he had refused to participate in the TIPas the eye witnesses had already seen him, yet except a bald assertion, noother foundation was laid for offering such an explanation – It is a longsettled law that if a witness is trustworthy and reliable, the mere fact thatno identifi cation parade could be conducted and the appellant convict was identifi ed for the fi rst time before the Trial Court, would not be a reason todiscard the evidence of the witness – Further, in a case where the accusedhimself declines to participate in a TIP, the prosecution has no option but toproceed in a normal manner like all other cases and rely upon the testimonyof the witnesses, which is recorded in Court during the course of the trial ofthe case – In the instant case, the PW-1 in his fi rst statement had categoricallystated that he can identify assailants, if brought before him and while givingstatements he had identifi ed all four assailants in the Court and their roles inthe crime – Besides that, when the appellant was arrested, he is said to havemade a disclosure statement – The statement was one relating to the weaponof off ence i.e. ice pick which was ultimately discovered from his house – Theevidence of the circumstance, simpliciter, that the accused pointed out tothe police offi cer, the place where he had concealed the weapon of off encei.e. ice pick, would be admissible as conduct u/s. 8 irrespective of the factwhether the statement made by the appellant convict contemporaneouslywith or antecedent to such conduct falls within the purview of s.27 of theEvidence Act or not – There was no infirmity in the line of reasoning adoptedby the Trial Court as well as by the High Court in holding the appellantconvict guilty of the alleged crime.

To put it in other words, can an accuseddecline to subject himself to the TIP on the ground that the same violateshis fundamental right under Article 20(3) of the Constitution?;(iv) To what extent the Court can draw an adverse inference againstthe accused for having refused to participate in the TIP? Whether by virtueof drawing such adverse inference, is it open for the Court to accept thesubstantive evidence of identifi cation before the Trial Court without anycorroboration to such identifi cation?;(v) What is the true purport of Section 54A of the CrPC?; (vi) Whether the Courts below were justifi ed in placing reliance on thediscovery of weapon of off ence and the currency notes from the residenceof the appellant convict as one of the incriminating circumstances againstthe appellant convict?Test Identifi cation Parade – Whether an accused can decline toparticipate in the TIP on the ground that he was already shown to theeye witnesses prior to the conduct of the TIP:Held: The accused while subjecting himself to the TIP does notproduce any evidence or perform any evidentiary act – It may be a positiveact and even a volitional act, but only to a limited extent, when the accusedis brought to the place where the TIP is to be held – It is certainly not hisevidentiary act – The accused concerned may have a legitimate ground toresist facing the TIP saying that the witnesses had a chance to see him eitherat the police station or in the Court, as the case may be, however, on suchground alone he cannot refuse to face the TIP – It is always open for theaccused to raise any legal ground available to him relating to the legitimacyof the TIP or the evidentiary value of the same in the course of the trial –However, the accused cannot decline or refuse to join the TIP. [Para 35]Test Identifi cation Parade – Whether TIP violates the fundamentalright of an accused under Article 20(3) of the Constitution.Held: What is prohibited by Article 20(3) of the Constitution isprocuring by compulsion of the positive volitional evidentiary acts of anaccused – It is true that an accused may be said to be compelled to attend atest identifi cation parade, but this compulsion does not involve any positivevolitional evidentiary act – His mere attendance or the exhibition of hisbody at a test identifi cation parade even though compelled, does not resultin any evidentiary act until he is identifi ed by some other agency – Theidentifi cation of him by a witness is not his act, even though his body isexhibited for the purpose – If the coercion is sought to be imposed in gettingfrom an accused evidence which cannot be procured save through positivevolitional act on his part, the constitutional guarantee as enshrined underArticle 20(3) of the Constitution will step in to protect him – However, ifthat evidence can be procured without any positive volitional evidentiaryact on the part of the accused, Article 20(3) of the Constitution will haveno application. [Paras 26 and 35] Test Identifi cation Parade – The test identifi cation parade providescorroboration to the identifi cation of the witness in court:Held: It is well settled that the substantive evidence is the evidenceof identification in court and the test identification parade providescorroboration to the identifi cation of the witness in court, if required –However, what weight must be attached to the evidence of identifi cation incourt, which is not preceded by a test identifi cation parade, is a matter forthe courts of fact to examine. [Para 48]Test Identifi cation Parade – Where an accused himself refused toparticipate in the TIP:Held: In a case where an accused himself refused to participate in theTIP, it is not open to him to contend that the statement of the eye witnessesmade for the fi rst time in Court, wherein they specifi cally point towards himas a person who had taken part in the commission of the crime, should notbe relied upon – Such a plea is available provided the prosecution is itselfresponsible for not holding a TIP – However, in a case where the accusedhimself declines to participate in a TIP, the prosecution has no option but toproceed in a normal manner like all other cases and rely upon the testimonyof the witnesses, which is recorded in Court during the course of the trialof the case. [Para 70]Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 – s.54A – Test Identifi cationParade – Obligation u/s. 54A CrPC:Held: The introduction of Section 54A in the CrPC, an accused isunder an obligation to stand for identifi cation parade – An accused cannotresist subjecting himself to the TIP on the ground that he cannot be forcedor coerced for the same – If the coercion is sought to be imposed in gettingfrom an accused evidence which cannot be procured save through positivevolitional act on his part, the constitutional guarantee as enshrined underArticle 20(3) of the Constitution will step in to protect him – However, ifthat evidence can be procured without any positive volitional evidentiaryact on the part of the accused, Article 20(3) of the Constitution will haveno application – The accused while subjecting himself to the TIP does notproduce any evidence or perform any evidentiary act. [Para 35] Test Identifi cation Parade – Importance and Evidentiary valueof TIP:Held: Facts which establish the identity of any person or thing whoseidentity is relevant are, by virtue of Section 9 of the Evidence Act, alwaysrelevant – The term ‘identifi cation’ means proving that a person, subjector article before the Court is the very same that he or it is alleged, chargedor reputed to be – Identifi cation is almost always a matter of opinion orbelief.

To put it in other words, can an accuseddecline to subject himself to the TIP on the ground that the same violateshis fundamental right under Article 20(3) of the Constitution?;(iv) To what extent the Court can draw an adverse inference againstthe accused for having refused to participate in the TIP? Whether by virtueof drawing such adverse inference, is it open for the Court to accept thesubstantive evidence of identifi cation before the Trial Court without anycorroboration to such identifi cation?;(v) What is the true purport of Section 54A of the CrPC?; (vi) Whether the Courts below were justifi ed in placing reliance on thediscovery of weapon of off ence and the currency notes from the residenceof the appellant convict as one of the incriminating circumstances againstthe appellant convict?Test Identifi cation Parade – Whether an accused can decline toparticipate in the TIP on the ground that he was already shown to theeye witnesses prior to the conduct of the TIP:Held: The accused while subjecting himself to the TIP does notproduce any evidence or perform any evidentiary act – It may be a positiveact and even a volitional act, but only to a limited extent, when the accusedis brought to the place where the TIP is to be held – It is certainly not hisevidentiary act – The accused concerned may have a legitimate ground toresist facing the TIP saying that the witnesses had a chance to see him eitherat the police station or in the Court, as the case may be, however, on suchground alone he cannot refuse to face the TIP – It is always open for theaccused to raise any legal ground available to him relating to the legitimacyof the TIP or the evidentiary value of the same in the course of the trial –However, the accused cannot decline or refuse to join the TIP. [Para 35]Test Identifi cation Parade – Whether TIP violates the fundamentalright of an accused under Article 20(3) of the Constitution.Held: What is prohibited by Article 20(3) of the Constitution isprocuring by compulsion of the positive volitional evidentiary acts of anaccused – It is true that an accused may be said to be compelled to attend atest identifi cation parade, but this compulsion does not involve any positivevolitional evidentiary act – His mere attendance or the exhibition of hisbody at a test identifi cation parade even though compelled, does not resultin any evidentiary act until he is identifi ed by some other agency – Theidentifi cation of him by a witness is not his act, even though his body isexhibited for the purpose – If the coercion is sought to be imposed in gettingfrom an accused evidence which cannot be procured save through positivevolitional act on his part, the constitutional guarantee as enshrined underArticle 20(3) of the Constitution will step in to protect him – However, ifthat evidence can be procured without any positive volitional evidentiaryact on the part of the accused, Article 20(3) of the Constitution will haveno application. [Paras 26 and 35] Test Identifi cation Parade – The test identifi cation parade providescorroboration to the identifi cation of the witness in court:Held: It is well settled that the substantive evidence is the evidenceof identification in court and the test identification parade providescorroboration to the identifi cation of the witness in court, if required –However, what weight must be attached to the evidence of identifi cation incourt, which is not preceded by a test identifi cation parade, is a matter forthe courts of fact to examine. [Para 48]Test Identifi cation Parade – Where an accused himself refused toparticipate in the TIP:Held: In a case where an accused himself refused to participate in theTIP, it is not open to him to contend that the statement of the eye witnessesmade for the fi rst time in Court, wherein they specifi cally point towards himas a person who had taken part in the commission of the crime, should notbe relied upon – Such a plea is available provided the prosecution is itselfresponsible for not holding a TIP – However, in a case where the accusedhimself declines to participate in a TIP, the prosecution has no option but toproceed in a normal manner like all other cases and rely upon the testimonyof the witnesses, which is recorded in Court during the course of the trialof the case. [Para 70]Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 – s.54A – Test Identifi cationParade – Obligation u/s. 54A CrPC:Held: The introduction of Section 54A in the CrPC, an accused isunder an obligation to stand for identifi cation parade – An accused cannotresist subjecting himself to the TIP on the ground that he cannot be forcedor coerced for the same – If the coercion is sought to be imposed in gettingfrom an accused evidence which cannot be procured save through positivevolitional act on his part, the constitutional guarantee as enshrined underArticle 20(3) of the Constitution will step in to protect him – However, ifthat evidence can be procured without any positive volitional evidentiaryact on the part of the accused, Article 20(3) of the Constitution will haveno application – The accused while subjecting himself to the TIP does notproduce any evidence or perform any evidentiary act. [Para 35] Test Identifi cation Parade – Importance and Evidentiary valueof TIP:Held: Facts which establish the identity of any person or thing whoseidentity is relevant are, by virtue of Section 9 of the Evidence Act, alwaysrelevant – The term ‘identifi cation’ means proving that a person, subjector article before the Court is the very same that he or it is alleged, chargedor reputed to be – Identifi cation is almost always a matter of opinion orbelief. [Para 37]Test Identifi cation Parade – Object of:Held: Before the investigating authorities send up a case to Court, theymust be satisfi ed that the persons arrested by them are the persons accusedof having committed the crime – If they were known to the witnesses, thewitnesses would have given their names and that would have established theiridentity, but when they were not known, their identity could be establishedonly if the witnesses on seeing them say that they are the off enders – Sinceit would be very easy for a witness who has little regard for truth, to say thatthe person arrested on suspicion was the off ender, he is confronted with thesuspect mixed with innocent men – If he picks him out, that would add tothe credibility of his statement that he was the off ender – This is the primaryobject of identification proceeding. [Paras 40 and 41]Penal Code, 1860 – Trial Court convicted appellant-convict u/ss. 302, 392, 394, 397 and sentenced him imprisonment for life – HighCourt affirmed the conviction and sentence – Propriety:Held: Appellant-convict stated that the PW-1 was in a position toidentify him for the fi rst time before the Trial Court only because he had theopportunity to see him on 15.09.2008 – In such circumstances, it is arguedon behalf of the appellant convict that there is no evidence to hold him guiltyfor the alleged crime – However, the State stated that is not a suffi cient ora good ground to discard the substantive evidence of identifi cation beforethe Trial Court – Although the appellant convict in his further statementrecorded u/s. 313 CrPC stated that he had refused to participate in the TIPas the eye witnesses had already seen him, yet except a bald assertion, noother foundation was laid for offering such an explanation – It is a longsettled law that if a witness is trustworthy and reliable, the mere fact thatno identifi cation parade could be conducted and the appellant convict was identifi ed for the fi rst time before the Trial Court, would not be a reason todiscard the evidence of the witness – Further, in a case where the accusedhimself declines to participate in a TIP, the prosecution has no option but toproceed in a normal manner like all other cases and rely upon the testimonyof the witnesses, which is recorded in Court during the course of the trial ofthe case – In the instant case, the PW-1 in his fi rst statement had categoricallystated that he can identify assailants, if brought before him and while givingstatements he had identifi ed all four assailants in the Court and their roles inthe crime – Besides that, when the appellant was arrested, he is said to havemade a disclosure statement – The statement was one relating to the weaponof off ence i.e. ice pick which was ultimately discovered from his house – Theevidence of the circumstance, simpliciter, that the accused pointed out tothe police offi cer, the place where he had concealed the weapon of off encei.e. ice pick, would be admissible as conduct u/s. 8 irrespective of the factwhether the statement made by the appellant convict contemporaneouslywith or antecedent to such conduct falls within the purview of s.27 of theEvidence Act or not – There was no infirmity in the line of reasoning adoptedby the Trial Court as well as by the High Court in holding the appellantconvict guilty of the alleged crime.

[Paras 23, 26, and 39]Constitution of India – Art. 22(4)(a) – Relevance of Art. 22(4)(a):Held: Reading of Art. 22(4)(a) would clearly indicate that no lawproviding for preventive detention shall authorize the detention of a personfor a period beyond three months – Thus, an order of detention cannot be fora period longer than three months unless, the Advisory Board has reportedbefore the expiration of the said period of three months that there is, in its opinion such suffi cient cause for detention – If the Advisory Board does notgive its opinion within a period of three months from the date of detention, insuch a case, the order of detention beyond the period of three months wouldbecome illegal and not otherwise – If within the period of three months, theAdvisory Board opines that there was no suffi cient cause for such detentionthen, the State Government would have to release the detenu forthwith –Thus, Art. 22(4)(a) in substance deals with the order of detention and hasnothing to do with the delegation of the power of detention by the StateGovernment to an Offi cer as stipulated u/s. 3(2) – Period of three monthsstipulated in Art. 22(4)(a) is relatable to the initial period of detention upto the stage of receipt of report of the Advisory Board and does not haveany bearing on the period of detention, which is continued subsequent tothe confi rmatory order being passed by the State Government on receipt ofthe report of the Advisory Board – Continuation of the detention pursuantto the confi rmatory order passed by the State Government need not alsospecify the period of detention; neither is it restricted to a period of threemonths only – If any period is specifi ed in the confi rmatory order, then theperiod of detention would be upto such period, if no period is specifi ed,then it would be for a maximum period of twelve months from the date ofdetention – State Government need not review the orders of detention everythree months after it has passed the confi rmatory order.

[Paras 23, 38, 71 and 72]Andhra Pradesh Prevention of Dangerous Activities of Bootleggers,Dacoits, Drug Off enders, Goondas, Immoral Traffi c Off endersand Land Grabbers Act, 1986 – s. 3(2) – Interpretation:Held: s. 3(2) has nothing to do with the period of detention – s. 3(2)is with respect to the delegation of powers by the State Government uponthe District Magistrate or Commissioner of Police, as the case may be,for exercise of powers u/s. 3(2) – Period as mentioned in s. 3(2) refers tothe period of delegation of powers by the State Government and it has norelevance at all to the period for which a person may be detained – Thus, s.3(2) provides that if the State Government is satisfi ed having regard to thecircumstances prevailing in any area within the local limits of the jurisdictionof a District Magistrate or a Commissioner of Police, it is necessary toempower the District Magistrate or the Commissioner of Police, as the casemay be, to exercise the powers of the State Government to order detentionof a person as provided by sub-section (1), then the State Government mayby an order in writing direct that during such period as may be specifi ed inthe order, the District Magistrate or the Commissioner of Police may also,if satisfi ed as provided in sub-section (1) exercises the powers of the StateGovernment as conferred by sub-section (1) – Proviso to sub-section (2)thus, has nothing to do with the period of detention of a detenu – Maximumperiod of detention is prescribed u/s. 13 which lays down that the personmay be detained in pursuance of any detention order made under the Actwhich has been confi rmed u/s. 12. [Paras 23, 26, and 39]Constitution of India – Art. 22(4)(a) – Relevance of Art. 22(4)(a):Held: Reading of Art. 22(4)(a) would clearly indicate that no lawproviding for preventive detention shall authorize the detention of a personfor a period beyond three months – Thus, an order of detention cannot be fora period longer than three months unless, the Advisory Board has reportedbefore the expiration of the said period of three months that there is, in its opinion such suffi cient cause for detention – If the Advisory Board does notgive its opinion within a period of three months from the date of detention, insuch a case, the order of detention beyond the period of three months wouldbecome illegal and not otherwise – If within the period of three months, theAdvisory Board opines that there was no suffi cient cause for such detentionthen, the State Government would have to release the detenu forthwith –Thus, Art. 22(4)(a) in substance deals with the order of detention and hasnothing to do with the delegation of the power of detention by the StateGovernment to an Offi cer as stipulated u/s. 3(2) – Period of three monthsstipulated in Art. 22(4)(a) is relatable to the initial period of detention upto the stage of receipt of report of the Advisory Board and does not haveany bearing on the period of detention, which is continued subsequent tothe confi rmatory order being passed by the State Government on receipt ofthe report of the Advisory Board – Continuation of the detention pursuantto the confi rmatory order passed by the State Government need not alsospecify the period of detention; neither is it restricted to a period of threemonths only – If any period is specifi ed in the confi rmatory order, then theperiod of detention would be upto such period, if no period is specifi ed,then it would be for a maximum period of twelve months from the date ofdetention – State Government need not review the orders of detention everythree months after it has passed the confi rmatory order.

[Paras 23, 38, 71 and 72]Andhra Pradesh Prevention of Dangerous Activities of Bootleggers,Dacoits, Drug Off enders, Goondas, Immoral Traffi c Off endersand Land Grabbers Act, 1986 – s. 3(2) – Interpretation:Held: s. 3(2) has nothing to do with the period of detention – s. 3(2)is with respect to the delegation of powers by the State Government uponthe District Magistrate or Commissioner of Police, as the case may be,for exercise of powers u/s. 3(2) – Period as mentioned in s. 3(2) refers tothe period of delegation of powers by the State Government and it has norelevance at all to the period for which a person may be detained – Thus, s.3(2) provides that if the State Government is satisfi ed having regard to thecircumstances prevailing in any area within the local limits of the jurisdictionof a District Magistrate or a Commissioner of Police, it is necessary toempower the District Magistrate or the Commissioner of Police, as the casemay be, to exercise the powers of the State Government to order detentionof a person as provided by sub-section (1), then the State Government mayby an order in writing direct that during such period as may be specifi ed inthe order, the District Magistrate or the Commissioner of Police may also,if satisfi ed as provided in sub-section (1) exercises the powers of the StateGovernment as conferred by sub-section (1) – Proviso to sub-section (2)thus, has nothing to do with the period of detention of a detenu – Maximumperiod of detention is prescribed u/s. 13 which lays down that the personmay be detained in pursuance of any detention order made under the Actwhich has been confi rmed u/s. 12. [Paras 23, 26, and 39]Constitution of India – Art. 22(4)(a) – Relevance of Art. 22(4)(a):Held: Reading of Art. 22(4)(a) would clearly indicate that no lawproviding for preventive detention shall authorize the detention of a personfor a period beyond three months – Thus, an order of detention cannot be fora period longer than three months unless, the Advisory Board has reportedbefore the expiration of the said period of three months that there is, in its opinion such suffi cient cause for detention – If the Advisory Board does notgive its opinion within a period of three months from the date of detention, insuch a case, the order of detention beyond the period of three months wouldbecome illegal and not otherwise – If within the period of three months, theAdvisory Board opines that there was no suffi cient cause for such detentionthen, the State Government would have to release the detenu forthwith –Thus, Art. 22(4)(a) in substance deals with the order of detention and hasnothing to do with the delegation of the power of detention by the StateGovernment to an Offi cer as stipulated u/s. 3(2) – Period of three monthsstipulated in Art. 22(4)(a) is relatable to the initial period of detention upto the stage of receipt of report of the Advisory Board and does not haveany bearing on the period of detention, which is continued subsequent tothe confi rmatory order being passed by the State Government on receipt ofthe report of the Advisory Board – Continuation of the detention pursuantto the confi rmatory order passed by the State Government need not alsospecify the period of detention; neither is it restricted to a period of threemonths only – If any period is specifi ed in the confi rmatory order, then theperiod of detention would be upto such period, if no period is specifi ed,then it would be for a maximum period of twelve months from the date ofdetention – State Government need not review the orders of detention everythree months after it has passed the confi rmatory order.

[Paras 23, 38, 71 and 72]Andhra Pradesh Prevention of Dangerous Activities of Bootleggers,Dacoits, Drug Off enders, Goondas, Immoral Traffi c Off endersand Land Grabbers Act, 1986 – s. 3(2) – Interpretation:Held: s. 3(2) has nothing to do with the period of detention – s. 3(2)is with respect to the delegation of powers by the State Government uponthe District Magistrate or Commissioner of Police, as the case may be,for exercise of powers u/s. 3(2) – Period as mentioned in s. 3(2) refers tothe period of delegation of powers by the State Government and it has norelevance at all to the period for which a person may be detained – Thus, s.3(2) provides that if the State Government is satisfi ed having regard to thecircumstances prevailing in any area within the local limits of the jurisdictionof a District Magistrate or a Commissioner of Police, it is necessary toempower the District Magistrate or the Commissioner of Police, as the casemay be, to exercise the powers of the State Government to order detentionof a person as provided by sub-section (1), then the State Government mayby an order in writing direct that during such period as may be specifi ed inthe order, the District Magistrate or the Commissioner of Police may also,if satisfi ed as provided in sub-section (1) exercises the powers of the StateGovernment as conferred by sub-section (1) – Proviso to sub-section (2)thus, has nothing to do with the period of detention of a detenu – Maximumperiod of detention is prescribed u/s. 13 which lays down that the personmay be detained in pursuance of any detention order made under the Actwhich has been confi rmed u/s. 12. [Paras 23, 26, and 39]Constitution of India – Art. 22(4)(a) – Relevance of Art. 22(4)(a):Held: Reading of Art. 22(4)(a) would clearly indicate that no lawproviding for preventive detention shall authorize the detention of a personfor a period beyond three months – Thus, an order of detention cannot be fora period longer than three months unless, the Advisory Board has reportedbefore the expiration of the said period of three months that there is, in its opinion such suffi cient cause for detention – If the Advisory Board does notgive its opinion within a period of three months from the date of detention, insuch a case, the order of detention beyond the period of three months wouldbecome illegal and not otherwise – If within the period of three months, theAdvisory Board opines that there was no suffi cient cause for such detentionthen, the State Government would have to release the detenu forthwith –Thus, Art. 22(4)(a) in substance deals with the order of detention and hasnothing to do with the delegation of the power of detention by the StateGovernment to an Offi cer as stipulated u/s. 3(2) – Period of three monthsstipulated in Art. 22(4)(a) is relatable to the initial period of detention upto the stage of receipt of report of the Advisory Board and does not haveany bearing on the period of detention, which is continued subsequent tothe confi rmatory order being passed by the State Government on receipt ofthe report of the Advisory Board – Continuation of the detention pursuantto the confi rmatory order passed by the State Government need not alsospecify the period of detention; neither is it restricted to a period of threemonths only – If any period is specifi ed in the confi rmatory order, then theperiod of detention would be upto such period, if no period is specifi ed,then it would be for a maximum period of twelve months from the date ofdetention – State Government need not review the orders of detention everythree months after it has passed the confi rmatory order.

[Paras 23, 38, 71 and 72]Andhra Pradesh Prevention of Dangerous Activities of Bootleggers,Dacoits, Drug Off enders, Goondas, Immoral Traffi c Off endersand Land Grabbers Act, 1986 – s. 3(2) – Interpretation:Held: s. 3(2) has nothing to do with the period of detention – s. 3(2)is with respect to the delegation of powers by the State Government uponthe District Magistrate or Commissioner of Police, as the case may be,for exercise of powers u/s. 3(2) – Period as mentioned in s. 3(2) refers tothe period of delegation of powers by the State Government and it has norelevance at all to the period for which a person may be detained – Thus, s.3(2) provides that if the State Government is satisfi ed having regard to thecircumstances prevailing in any area within the local limits of the jurisdictionof a District Magistrate or a Commissioner of Police, it is necessary toempower the District Magistrate or the Commissioner of Police, as the casemay be, to exercise the powers of the State Government to order detentionof a person as provided by sub-section (1), then the State Government mayby an order in writing direct that during such period as may be specifi ed inthe order, the District Magistrate or the Commissioner of Police may also,if satisfi ed as provided in sub-section (1) exercises the powers of the StateGovernment as conferred by sub-section (1) – Proviso to sub-section (2)thus, has nothing to do with the period of detention of a detenu – Maximumperiod of detention is prescribed u/s. 13 which lays down that the personmay be detained in pursuance of any detention order made under the Actwhich has been confi rmed u/s. 12. [Paras 23, 26, and 39]Constitution of India – Art. 22(4)(a) – Relevance of Art. 22(4)(a):Held: Reading of Art. 22(4)(a) would clearly indicate that no lawproviding for preventive detention shall authorize the detention of a personfor a period beyond three months – Thus, an order of detention cannot be fora period longer than three months unless, the Advisory Board has reportedbefore the expiration of the said period of three months that there is, in its opinion such suffi cient cause for detention – If the Advisory Board does notgive its opinion within a period of three months from the date of detention, insuch a case, the order of detention beyond the period of three months wouldbecome illegal and not otherwise – If within the period of three months, theAdvisory Board opines that there was no suffi cient cause for such detentionthen, the State Government would have to release the detenu forthwith –Thus, Art. 22(4)(a) in substance deals with the order of detention and hasnothing to do with the delegation of the power of detention by the StateGovernment to an Offi cer as stipulated u/s. 3(2) – Period of three monthsstipulated in Art. 22(4)(a) is relatable to the initial period of detention upto the stage of receipt of report of the Advisory Board and does not haveany bearing on the period of detention, which is continued subsequent tothe confi rmatory order being passed by the State Government on receipt ofthe report of the Advisory Board – Continuation of the detention pursuantto the confi rmatory order passed by the State Government need not alsospecify the period of detention; neither is it restricted to a period of threemonths only – If any period is specifi ed in the confi rmatory order, then theperiod of detention would be upto such period, if no period is specifi ed,then it would be for a maximum period of twelve months from the date ofdetention – State Government need not review the orders of detention everythree months after it has passed the confi rmatory order. [Paras 41–44]Andhra Pradesh Prevention of Dangerous Activities of Bootleggers,Dacoits, Drug Off enders, Goondas, Immoral Traffi c Off endersand Land Grabbers Act, 1986 – Preventive detention – Appellantindulging in distributing, storing, transporting and selling ID Liquor– Four FIRs against detenu, if suffi cient to arrive at a subjectivesatisfaction that activities of detenu as a boot-legger is prejudicial tothe maintenance of public order:Held: For determining the connection of ground of detention with themaintenance of public order, the object of detention, is not an intrinsic qualityof the act but rather its latent potentiality – Thus, for determining whetherthe ground of detention is relevant for the purposes of public order or not,merely an objective test based on the intrinsic quality of an act would notbe a safe guide – Potentiality of the act has to be examined in the light ofthe surrounding circumstances, posterior and anterior for the off ences underthe Prohibition Act – Just because four cases have been registered against the detenu under the Prohibition Act, by itself, may not have any bearingon the maintenance of public order – If the liquor sold by the detenu isdangerous to public health then under the Act 1986, it becomes an activityprejudicial to the maintenance of public order, thus, it becomes necessaryfor the detaining authority to be satisfi ed on material available – Detainingauthority specifi cally stated in the grounds of detention that selling liquor bythe detenu and the consumption by the people of that locality was harmful totheir health – Such statement is an expression of his subjective satisfactionthat the activities of the detenu is prejudicial to the maintenance of publicorder – Not only that, the detaining authority also recorded his satisfactionthat it is necessary to prevent the detenu appellant from indulging furtherin such activities and this satisfaction has been drawn on the basis of thecredible material on record.

[Paras 23, 26, and 39]Constitution of India – Art. 22(4)(a) – Relevance of Art. 22(4)(a):Held: Reading of Art. 22(4)(a) would clearly indicate that no lawproviding for preventive detention shall authorize the detention of a personfor a period beyond three months – Thus, an order of detention cannot be fora period longer than three months unless, the Advisory Board has reportedbefore the expiration of the said period of three months that there is, in its opinion such suffi cient cause for detention – If the Advisory Board does notgive its opinion within a period of three months from the date of detention, insuch a case, the order of detention beyond the period of three months wouldbecome illegal and not otherwise – If within the period of three months, theAdvisory Board opines that there was no suffi cient cause for such detentionthen, the State Government would have to release the detenu forthwith –Thus, Art. 22(4)(a) in substance deals with the order of detention and hasnothing to do with the delegation of the power of detention by the StateGovernment to an Offi cer as stipulated u/s. 3(2) – Period of three monthsstipulated in Art. 22(4)(a) is relatable to the initial period of detention upto the stage of receipt of report of the Advisory Board and does not haveany bearing on the period of detention, which is continued subsequent tothe confi rmatory order being passed by the State Government on receipt ofthe report of the Advisory Board – Continuation of the detention pursuantto the confi rmatory order passed by the State Government need not alsospecify the period of detention; neither is it restricted to a period of threemonths only – If any period is specifi ed in the confi rmatory order, then theperiod of detention would be upto such period, if no period is specifi ed,then it would be for a maximum period of twelve months from the date ofdetention – State Government need not review the orders of detention everythree months after it has passed the confi rmatory order.

[Paras 23, 38, 71 and 72]Andhra Pradesh Prevention of Dangerous Activities of Bootleggers,Dacoits, Drug Off enders, Goondas, Immoral Traffi c Off endersand Land Grabbers Act, 1986 – s. 3(2) – Interpretation:Held: s. 3(2) has nothing to do with the period of detention – s. 3(2)is with respect to the delegation of powers by the State Government uponthe District Magistrate or Commissioner of Police, as the case may be,for exercise of powers u/s. 3(2) – Period as mentioned in s. 3(2) refers tothe period of delegation of powers by the State Government and it has norelevance at all to the period for which a person may be detained – Thus, s.3(2) provides that if the State Government is satisfi ed having regard to thecircumstances prevailing in any area within the local limits of the jurisdictionof a District Magistrate or a Commissioner of Police, it is necessary toempower the District Magistrate or the Commissioner of Police, as the casemay be, to exercise the powers of the State Government to order detentionof a person as provided by sub-section (1), then the State Government mayby an order in writing direct that during such period as may be specifi ed inthe order, the District Magistrate or the Commissioner of Police may also,if satisfi ed as provided in sub-section (1) exercises the powers of the StateGovernment as conferred by sub-section (1) – Proviso to sub-section (2)thus, has nothing to do with the period of detention of a detenu – Maximumperiod of detention is prescribed u/s. 13 which lays down that the personmay be detained in pursuance of any detention order made under the Actwhich has been confi rmed u/s. 12. [Paras 23, 26, and 39]Constitution of India – Art. 22(4)(a) – Relevance of Art. 22(4)(a):Held: Reading of Art. 22(4)(a) would clearly indicate that no lawproviding for preventive detention shall authorize the detention of a personfor a period beyond three months – Thus, an order of detention cannot be fora period longer than three months unless, the Advisory Board has reportedbefore the expiration of the said period of three months that there is, in its opinion such suffi cient cause for detention – If the Advisory Board does notgive its opinion within a period of three months from the date of detention, insuch a case, the order of detention beyond the period of three months wouldbecome illegal and not otherwise – If within the period of three months, theAdvisory Board opines that there was no suffi cient cause for such detentionthen, the State Government would have to release the detenu forthwith –Thus, Art. 22(4)(a) in substance deals with the order of detention and hasnothing to do with the delegation of the power of detention by the StateGovernment to an Offi cer as stipulated u/s. 3(2) – Period of three monthsstipulated in Art. 22(4)(a) is relatable to the initial period of detention upto the stage of receipt of report of the Advisory Board and does not haveany bearing on the period of detention, which is continued subsequent tothe confi rmatory order being passed by the State Government on receipt ofthe report of the Advisory Board – Continuation of the detention pursuantto the confi rmatory order passed by the State Government need not alsospecify the period of detention; neither is it restricted to a period of threemonths only – If any period is specifi ed in the confi rmatory order, then theperiod of detention would be upto such period, if no period is specifi ed,then it would be for a maximum period of twelve months from the date ofdetention – State Government need not review the orders of detention everythree months after it has passed the confi rmatory order.

[Paras 23, 38, 71 and 72]Andhra Pradesh Prevention of Dangerous Activities of Bootleggers,Dacoits, Drug Off enders, Goondas, Immoral Traffi c Off endersand Land Grabbers Act, 1986 – s. 3(2) – Interpretation:Held: s. 3(2) has nothing to do with the period of detention – s. 3(2)is with respect to the delegation of powers by the State Government uponthe District Magistrate or Commissioner of Police, as the case may be,for exercise of powers u/s. 3(2) – Period as mentioned in s. 3(2) refers tothe period of delegation of powers by the State Government and it has norelevance at all to the period for which a person may be detained – Thus, s.3(2) provides that if the State Government is satisfi ed having regard to thecircumstances prevailing in any area within the local limits of the jurisdictionof a District Magistrate or a Commissioner of Police, it is necessary toempower the District Magistrate or the Commissioner of Police, as the casemay be, to exercise the powers of the State Government to order detentionof a person as provided by sub-section (1), then the State Government mayby an order in writing direct that during such period as may be specifi ed inthe order, the District Magistrate or the Commissioner of Police may also,if satisfi ed as provided in sub-section (1) exercises the powers of the StateGovernment as conferred by sub-section (1) – Proviso to sub-section (2)thus, has nothing to do with the period of detention of a detenu – Maximumperiod of detention is prescribed u/s. 13 which lays down that the personmay be detained in pursuance of any detention order made under the Actwhich has been confi rmed u/s. 12. [Paras 23, 26, and 39]Constitution of India – Art. 22(4)(a) – Relevance of Art. 22(4)(a):Held: Reading of Art. 22(4)(a) would clearly indicate that no lawproviding for preventive detention shall authorize the detention of a personfor a period beyond three months – Thus, an order of detention cannot be fora period longer than three months unless, the Advisory Board has reportedbefore the expiration of the said period of three months that there is, in its opinion such suffi cient cause for detention – If the Advisory Board does notgive its opinion within a period of three months from the date of detention, insuch a case, the order of detention beyond the period of three months wouldbecome illegal and not otherwise – If within the period of three months, theAdvisory Board opines that there was no suffi cient cause for such detentionthen, the State Government would have to release the detenu forthwith –Thus, Art. 22(4)(a) in substance deals with the order of detention and hasnothing to do with the delegation of the power of detention by the StateGovernment to an Offi cer as stipulated u/s. 3(2) – Period of three monthsstipulated in Art. 22(4)(a) is relatable to the initial period of detention upto the stage of receipt of report of the Advisory Board and does not haveany bearing on the period of detention, which is continued subsequent tothe confi rmatory order being passed by the State Government on receipt ofthe report of the Advisory Board – Continuation of the detention pursuantto the confi rmatory order passed by the State Government need not alsospecify the period of detention; neither is it restricted to a period of threemonths only – If any period is specifi ed in the confi rmatory order, then theperiod of detention would be upto such period, if no period is specifi ed,then it would be for a maximum period of twelve months from the date ofdetention – State Government need not review the orders of detention everythree months after it has passed the confi rmatory order.

[Paras 23, 38, 71 and 72]Andhra Pradesh Prevention of Dangerous Activities of Bootleggers,Dacoits, Drug Off enders, Goondas, Immoral Traffi c Off endersand Land Grabbers Act, 1986 – s. 3(2) – Interpretation:Held: s. 3(2) has nothing to do with the period of detention – s. 3(2)is with respect to the delegation of powers by the State Government uponthe District Magistrate or Commissioner of Police, as the case may be,for exercise of powers u/s. 3(2) – Period as mentioned in s. 3(2) refers tothe period of delegation of powers by the State Government and it has norelevance at all to the period for which a person may be detained – Thus, s.3(2) provides that if the State Government is satisfi ed having regard to thecircumstances prevailing in any area within the local limits of the jurisdictionof a District Magistrate or a Commissioner of Police, it is necessary toempower the District Magistrate or the Commissioner of Police, as the casemay be, to exercise the powers of the State Government to order detentionof a person as provided by sub-section (1), then the State Government mayby an order in writing direct that during such period as may be specifi ed inthe order, the District Magistrate or the Commissioner of Police may also,if satisfi ed as provided in sub-section (1) exercises the powers of the StateGovernment as conferred by sub-section (1) – Proviso to sub-section (2)thus, has nothing to do with the period of detention of a detenu – Maximumperiod of detention is prescribed u/s. 13 which lays down that the personmay be detained in pursuance of any detention order made under the Actwhich has been confi rmed u/s. 12. [Paras 23, 26, and 39]Constitution of India – Art. 22(4)(a) – Relevance of Art. 22(4)(a):Held: Reading of Art. 22(4)(a) would clearly indicate that no lawproviding for preventive detention shall authorize the detention of a personfor a period beyond three months – Thus, an order of detention cannot be fora period longer than three months unless, the Advisory Board has reportedbefore the expiration of the said period of three months that there is, in its opinion such suffi cient cause for detention – If the Advisory Board does notgive its opinion within a period of three months from the date of detention, insuch a case, the order of detention beyond the period of three months wouldbecome illegal and not otherwise – If within the period of three months, theAdvisory Board opines that there was no suffi cient cause for such detentionthen, the State Government would have to release the detenu forthwith –Thus, Art. 22(4)(a) in substance deals with the order of detention and hasnothing to do with the delegation of the power of detention by the StateGovernment to an Offi cer as stipulated u/s. 3(2) – Period of three monthsstipulated in Art. 22(4)(a) is relatable to the initial period of detention upto the stage of receipt of report of the Advisory Board and does not haveany bearing on the period of detention, which is continued subsequent tothe confi rmatory order being passed by the State Government on receipt ofthe report of the Advisory Board – Continuation of the detention pursuantto the confi rmatory order passed by the State Government need not alsospecify the period of detention; neither is it restricted to a period of threemonths only – If any period is specifi ed in the confi rmatory order, then theperiod of detention would be upto such period, if no period is specifi ed,then it would be for a maximum period of twelve months from the date ofdetention – State Government need not review the orders of detention everythree months after it has passed the confi rmatory order. [Paras 41–44]Andhra Pradesh Prevention of Dangerous Activities of Bootleggers,Dacoits, Drug Off enders, Goondas, Immoral Traffi c Off endersand Land Grabbers Act, 1986 – Preventive detention – Appellantindulging in distributing, storing, transporting and selling ID Liquor– Four FIRs against detenu, if suffi cient to arrive at a subjectivesatisfaction that activities of detenu as a boot-legger is prejudicial tothe maintenance of public order:Held: For determining the connection of ground of detention with themaintenance of public order, the object of detention, is not an intrinsic qualityof the act but rather its latent potentiality – Thus, for determining whetherthe ground of detention is relevant for the purposes of public order or not,merely an objective test based on the intrinsic quality of an act would notbe a safe guide – Potentiality of the act has to be examined in the light ofthe surrounding circumstances, posterior and anterior for the off ences underthe Prohibition Act – Just because four cases have been registered against the detenu under the Prohibition Act, by itself, may not have any bearingon the maintenance of public order – If the liquor sold by the detenu isdangerous to public health then under the Act 1986, it becomes an activityprejudicial to the maintenance of public order, thus, it becomes necessaryfor the detaining authority to be satisfi ed on material available – Detainingauthority specifi cally stated in the grounds of detention that selling liquor bythe detenu and the consumption by the people of that locality was harmful totheir health – Such statement is an expression of his subjective satisfactionthat the activities of the detenu is prejudicial to the maintenance of publicorder – Not only that, the detaining authority also recorded his satisfactionthat it is necessary to prevent the detenu appellant from indulging furtherin such activities and this satisfaction has been drawn on the basis of thecredible material on record.

[Paras 29, 30, 35 and 36]Penal Code, 1860 – s. 395 – Punishment for Dacoity – FIR allegingthat to settle a land dispute the informant and his brother visitedthe house of the appellant wherein the appellant and the co-accusedassaulted the informant and his brother and forcibly took R. 2 lakh fromthe informants’ pocket – Registration of FIR for the off ence punishableu/s. 395, 504, 506 and 323 IPC – Correctness:Held: s. 395 is not applicable to the instant case – Prosecutionblindfoldedly and without understanding the true purport of the off enceof “dacoity” registered the FIR for the off ence punishable u/s. 395 – Noneof the ingredients to constitute the off ence of dacoity disclosed – Entirecase put up by the fi rst informant appears to be fabricated – At the time ofalleged incident, taking away of Rs. 2 Lakh from the pocket of the informantforcibly by the accused persons would not fall within the ambit of the words“for that end” occurring in s. 390 – Even according to the informant, witha view to settle the land dispute, the informant and his brother visited thehouse of the appellant on their own free will and volition – It is only afterreaching the house of the appellant that the entire incident is alleged to haveoccurred. [Paras 17 and 18]Penal Code, 1860 – s. 390 – Robbery – Theft when amounts torobbery:Held: Three ingredients mentioned in s.390 must always be satisfi edbefore theft can amount to robbery – Firstly, the off ender must havevoluntarily caused or attempted to cause to any person death or hurt orwrongful restraint, or fear of instant death or of instant hurt, or of instantwrongful restraint – Secondly this must be in order to the committing of thetheft, or in committing the theft, or in carrying away or attempting to carryaway property obtained by the theft – Thirdly the off ender must voluntarilycause or attempt to cause to any person hurt etc., for that end, that is, inorder to the committing of the theft or for the purpose of committing theftor for carrying away or attempting to carry away property obtained by thetheft. [Paras 14 and 15]Penal Code, 1860 – s. 504 – Intentional insult with intent to provokebreach of peace – Necessary ingredient u/s. 504: Held: Mere abuse, discourtesy, rudeness or insolence, may not amountto an intentional insult within the meaning of s. 504 if it does not have thenecessary element of being likely to incite the person insulted to commita breach of the peace of an off ence and the other element of the accusedintending to provoke the person insulted to commit a breach of the peace orknowing that the person insulted is likely to commit a breach of the peace– Each case of abusive language shall have to be decided in the light of thefacts and circumstances of that case – There cannot be a general propositionthat no one commits an off ence u/s. 504 if he merely uses abusive languageagainst the complainant. [Paras 25 and 26]Penal Code, 1860 – s. 506 – Off ence of criminal intimidation –When:Held: Before an off ence of criminal intimidation is made out, itmust be established that the accused had an intention to cause alarm tothe complainant – On facts, to settle a land dispute the informant and hisbrother visited the house of the appellant on their own free will wherein theappellant and the other co-accused assaulted the informant and his brother,forcibly took Rs. 2 lakh from the informants’ pocket and thereafter tooktheir signatures forcibly on a blank paper and FIR was registered u/ss. 395,504, 506 and 323 – Prima facie case to constitute the off ence punishableu/s. 506 may probably could be said to have been disclosed but not u/s.504 – In the FIR, all that the informant has stated is that abusive languagewas used by the accused persons – What exactly was uttered in the form ofabuses not stated in the FIR – One of the essential elements constituting anoff ence u/s. 504 is that there should have been an act or conduct amountingto intentional insult – Where that act is the use of the abusive words, it isnecessary to know what those words were in order to decide whether theuse of those words amounted to intentional insult – In the absence thereof,not possible to decide whether the ingredient of intentional insult present– Thus, case of criminal intimidation punishable u/ss. 504 and 506(2) notmade out. [Para 29]Interpretation of statutes – Penal statute – Interpretation of:Held: Must be strictly construed – Court must see that the thing chargedis an off ence within the plain meaning of the words used and must not strainthe words. [Paras 19 and 21] FIR – Quashing of – Invocation of inherent powers u/s. 482 CrPCor extraordinary jurisdiction u/Art. 226 of the Constitution – Duty ofthe court:Held: Whenever an accused seeks quashing of the FIR or thecriminal proceedings essentially on the ground that such proceedings aremanifestly frivolous or vexatious or instituted with the ulterior motivefor wreaking vengeance, in such circumstances the Court owes a dutyto look into the FIR with care and a little more closely – It would not bejust enough for the Court to look into the averments made in the FIR/complaint alone for the purpose of the alleged off ence are disclosed ornot – In frivolous or vexatious proceedings, the Court owes a duty tolook into many other attending circumstances emerging from the recordof the case over and above the averments and, if need be, with due careand circumspection try to read in between the lines – Court is empoweredto take into account the overall circumstances leading to the initiation/registration of the case as well as the materials collected in the courseof investigation. [Para 26]FIR – Importance and object of:Held: FIR in a criminal case is an extremely vital and valuable pieceof evidence for the purpose of corroborating the oral evidence adduced atthe trial – Object of insisting upon lodging of the FIR to the police in respectof commission of an off ence is to obtain early information regarding thecircumstances in which the crime was committed, the names of the actualculprits and the part played by them as well as names of the eye witnessespresent at the scene of occurrence. [Para 32]Delay/ Laches – Delay in lodging FIR – Ground to quash FIR:Held: Delay in the registration of the FIR, by itself, cannot be a groundfor quashing of the FIR – However, delay with other attending circumstancesrendering the entire case put up by the prosecution inherently improbable,may at times become a good ground to quash the FIR and consequentialproceedings – If the FIR, like the instant one, lodged after a period of morethan one year without disclosing the date and time of the alleged incidentand further without any plausible and convincing explanation for such delay,the accused cannot defend himself in the trial – Allegations are too vague and general – In the absence of all this material, the State cannot prove itscase against the accused persons. [Paras 32 and 33]Criminal Law – Criminal antecedents of the accused – Eff ect of,on the criminal proceedings:Held: Criminal antecedents of the accused cannot be the soleconsideration to decline to quash the criminal proceedings – An accused hasa legitimate right to say before the Court that howsoever bad his antecedentsmay be, still if the FIR fails to disclose commission of any off ence then thecourt should not decline to quash the criminal case – Initiation of prosecutionhas adverse and harsh consequence for the persons named as accused –Thus, the requirement and need to balance the law enforcement power andprotection of citizens from injustice and harassment must be maintained –State owes a duty to ensure that no crime goes unpunished as also owes aduty to ensure that none of its subjects are unnecessarily harassed.

Except in the rarest of rarecases, judicial notice of any fact is generally not taken in criminal mattersin the normal course of proceeding. The present matter falls in the categoryof rarest of rare cases. Certain inferences, observations and fi ndings arrivedat by the Division Bench of High Court in judgment dated 13.03.2007in the Habeas Corpus Petition, have a crucial impact on the merit of thepresent case, as it gives a complete picture as to how the prosecutionversion in the present case was being demolished brick by brick by usingpolitical authority and muscle power with the aid of not only the policeadministration but also with the aid of Public Prosecutor and, the PresidingOffi cer of the Trial Court also conducted himself in a manner unbecomingof a Judicial Offi cer, despite directions and continuous vigil by the HighCourt. The judgment dated 13.03.2007, which is a public document, iswell discussed and is based upon authoritative materials and was passedin consonance with the doctrine of audi alteram partem. Moreover, it hasa torch bearer eff ect over the facts of the case. Accordingly, judicial noticetaken by the Supreme Court of the inferences, observations and fi ndingsarrived at by the Division Bench and the directions issued in its judgmentdated 13.03.2007 to the extent of the subsequent conduct of the accused,deplorable functioning of the Public Prosecutor, Police Administrationand the Presiding Offi cer of the Trial Court to extend undesirable favourto the accused. [Paras 66, 67 and 68] Evidence Act, 1872 – s.8 – Subsequent conduct of accused – Adverseinference – Maxim “qui sentit commodom, sentire debit et onus.”:Held: In the case in hand, a double murder case, the conduct ofaccused-respondent no.2 was not only relevant u/s.8 of the Evidence Actbut also one of the major circumstances to arrive at a conclusion about hisguilt. Respondent No.2 was instrumental in making all possible eff orts towipe out the evidence against him. The tainted investigation shows thehighhandedness of the Respondent no.2, who was a powerful person, beinga sitting M.P. of the Ruling Party. The question is why the accused wasinstrumental, when he was not guilty of the off ence to which he was beingtried. The obvious answer would be that his guilty mind was fearful aboutthe result. [Paras 70, 72, 73 and 114]Evidence Act, 1872 – s.74 – Bayan Tahriri / Written Statement ofdeceased – Evidentiary value:Held: FIR is a public document defi ned u/s.74 of the Evidence Act. Anypublic document does not stand proven by the mere fact of its production.At the stage of exhibiting any document as a piece of evidence, the truthof what is stated in the document is not considered. It is left open to fi nalevaluation at the trial after cross-examination, and the entire testimony ofthe witness about the existence and contents of the document is weighedin conjunction with various other factors emerging during a trial. Themarking of a piece of evidence as ‘exhibit’ at the stage of evidence in a trialproceeding is only for the purpose of identifi cation of evidence adducedin the trial and for the convenience of the Court and other stakeholders inorder to get a clear picture of what is being produced as evidence in a trialproceeding. In the present case, considering the failure of State machineryand failure of the Trial Court to ensure a fair trial from the perspective ofthe victim side, the aspect of non-marking of the FIR and Bayan Tahririas an exhibit, non-production of the formal witnesses, i.e., the ConstableClerk and Investigating Offi cer to prove the lodging of FIR/Bayan Tahririand fl imsy rejection of application fi led by a person seeking his examinationas a witness along with examination of two persons (who had signed saidwritten statement/Bayan Tahriri as attesting persons) as witnesses in the Trialproceeding do not vitiate the genuineness of the FIR and Bayan Tahriri, andno discount can be given to the accused persons for non-exhibition thereof.[Paras 82, 83, 85, 87 and 89] Evidence Act, 1872 – s.32 – Treatment of FIR /Bayan Tahriri asdying declaration:Held: Statement by an injured person recorded as FIR can be treated asa dying declaration and such a statement is admissible u/s.32 of the EvidenceAct. On facts, the deceased gave his statement in the form of Bayan Tahririand narrated the entire incident and circumstances of the transaction whichresulted in his death. Subsequently, he died on account of injuries suff eredby him in the incident in question. FIR lodged on the basis of Bayan Tahrirof the injured is liable to be treated as a dying declaration, which itself is asubstantive piece of evidence and is admissible u/s.32(1) of the EvidenceAct. [Paras 91 and 95]Evidence – Ocular evidence – Testimony of deceased’s mother,an eyewitness, who was abducted by the accused side just before herexamination in the trial court.Held: The High Court ought to have considered the checkered historyof events that occurred in the case, resulting in the judgment of the DivisionBench of the High Court in the Habeas Corpus Petition containing seriousobservations about the conduct of all the stakeholders of the said criminaltrial. CW-1’s fi rst examination was scrapped by the High Court on theallegation of her kidnapping just a few days before that fi rst examinationdated 03.11.2006. She was under continuous threat and fear of facing direconsequence, which is apparent on the face of the record. Under thesecircumstances, in case she had stated in the end of her cross-examination thather son had asked her to take the name of the accused before the Trial Court,there is nothing so contradictory or surprising so as to treat the rest of thesubstantive ocular evidence as tutored one. There is no serious discrepancyor variation in the testimony of CW-1 with regard to the sequence of eventsthat occurred during the incident in question. When the entire family of CW-1was facing so many storms, it is quite natural for a son to say to her mother(who was old, illiterate, rustic woman having faced immense trauma) thatshe should not forget to disclose the name of accused persons, in as much asthe second occasion of her examination, as ordered by the Division Benchof High Court under Section 311 of CrPC, was the last opportunity for herto speak the truth before the Trial Court. There is nothing unusual in thestatement of CW-1. Her statement is found to be reliable, and the Courtsbelow wrongly discarded it on the ground that it was hearsay and tutored.[Paras 101, 102, 103, 104 and 114] Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 – s.311 – Power under – Scope:Held: s.311 CrPC confers wide powers on any court at any stage of anyinquiry, trial or other proceeding under this Code to summon material witnessor examine person present. Such person may not be a person summonedas a witness. Power to recall and re-examine is also vested. The concept isthat it should be essential for the just decision of the case. This power canbe exercised not only by the Trial Court but also by the appellate Court orrevisional Court. The logic behind this provision is that the endeavour of theCourts is to fi nd out the truth which would be essential for the just decisionof the case. [Para 112]Penal Code, 1860 – ss.302 and 307 – Double murder – Due toinjuries caused by fi re arm – Appeal against acquittal.Held: On facts, the post-mortem reports, show that the deaths werehomicidal in nature. The medico legal reports supported the prosecution’sstory to the extent that the injuries were caused by a fi re arm, which provedfatal for two out of the three injured. Fard Bayan registered on oral statementgiven by one of the injured (who died subsequently), which was laterconverted into an FIR, was admissible in evidence and is to be read as adying declaration or his last statement. The prosecution had established, eventhrough the hostile witnesses, that the date, time, and place of incidence asgiven in the Fard Bayan were fully established. Adverse inference againstthe accused is drawn in view of their subsequent conduct. Judicial notice istaken of judgment in the Habeas Corpus petition dated 13.07.2007 regardingthe conduct of the accused, the investigating agency, the Public Prosecutorand the Presiding Offi cer conducting the trial. Statement of CW-1 is foundto be reliable, and the Courts below wrongly discarded it on the groundthat it was hearsay and tutored. The dying declaration and the statement ofCW-1 fully establish that it was Respondent No.2 (accused no.1), who hadcaused the injuries from his fi rearm weapon, which proved to be fatal fortwo out of the three injured and also caused injury to the third survivinginjured. Respondent no.2 thus liable to be convicted under ss.302 and 307IPC. The rest of the accused, although named in the chargesheet after dueinvestigation, since their names were not refl ected either in the Fard Bayanof the deceased (dying declaration) or in the statement of CW1, therefore,their acquittal is not disturbed.

CW-1’s fi rst examination was scrapped by the High Court on theallegation of her kidnapping just a few days before that fi rst examinationdated 03.11.2006. She was under continuous threat and fear of facing direconsequence, which is apparent on the face of the record. Under thesecircumstances, in case she had stated in the end of her cross-examination thather son had asked her to take the name of the accused before the Trial Court,there is nothing so contradictory or surprising so as to treat the rest of thesubstantive ocular evidence as tutored one. There is no serious discrepancyor variation in the testimony of CW-1 with regard to the sequence of eventsthat occurred during the incident in question. When the entire family of CW-1was facing so many storms, it is quite natural for a son to say to her mother(who was old, illiterate, rustic woman having faced immense trauma) thatshe should not forget to disclose the name of accused persons, in as much asthe second occasion of her examination, as ordered by the Division Benchof High Court under Section 311 of CrPC, was the last opportunity for herto speak the truth before the Trial Court. There is nothing unusual in thestatement of CW-1. Her statement is found to be reliable, and the Courtsbelow wrongly discarded it on the ground that it was hearsay and tutored.[Paras 101, 102, 103, 104 and 114] Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 – s.311 – Power under – Scope:Held: s.311 CrPC confers wide powers on any court at any stage of anyinquiry, trial or other proceeding under this Code to summon material witnessor examine person present. Such person may not be a person summonedas a witness. Power to recall and re-examine is also vested. The concept isthat it should be essential for the just decision of the case. This power canbe exercised not only by the Trial Court but also by the appellate Court orrevisional Court. The logic behind this provision is that the endeavour of theCourts is to fi nd out the truth which would be essential for the just decisionof the case. [Para 112]Penal Code, 1860 – ss.302 and 307 – Double murder – Due toinjuries caused by fi re arm – Appeal against acquittal.Held: On facts, the post-mortem reports, show that the deaths werehomicidal in nature. The medico legal reports supported the prosecution’sstory to the extent that the injuries were caused by a fi re arm, which provedfatal for two out of the three injured. Fard Bayan registered on oral statementgiven by one of the injured (who died subsequently), which was laterconverted into an FIR, was admissible in evidence and is to be read as adying declaration or his last statement. The prosecution had established, eventhrough the hostile witnesses, that the date, time, and place of incidence asgiven in the Fard Bayan were fully established. Adverse inference againstthe accused is drawn in view of their subsequent conduct. Judicial notice istaken of judgment in the Habeas Corpus petition dated 13.07.2007 regardingthe conduct of the accused, the investigating agency, the Public Prosecutorand the Presiding Offi cer conducting the trial. Statement of CW-1 is foundto be reliable, and the Courts below wrongly discarded it on the groundthat it was hearsay and tutored. The dying declaration and the statement ofCW-1 fully establish that it was Respondent No.2 (accused no.1), who hadcaused the injuries from his fi rearm weapon, which proved to be fatal fortwo out of the three injured and also caused injury to the third survivinginjured. Respondent no.2 thus liable to be convicted under ss.302 and 307IPC. The rest of the accused, although named in the chargesheet after dueinvestigation, since their names were not refl ected either in the Fard Bayanof the deceased (dying declaration) or in the statement of CW1, therefore,their acquittal is not disturbed.

Except in the rarest of rarecases, judicial notice of any fact is generally not taken in criminal mattersin the normal course of proceeding. The present matter falls in the categoryof rarest of rare cases. Certain inferences, observations and fi ndings arrivedat by the Division Bench of High Court in judgment dated 13.03.2007in the Habeas Corpus Petition, have a crucial impact on the merit of thepresent case, as it gives a complete picture as to how the prosecutionversion in the present case was being demolished brick by brick by usingpolitical authority and muscle power with the aid of not only the policeadministration but also with the aid of Public Prosecutor and, the PresidingOffi cer of the Trial Court also conducted himself in a manner unbecomingof a Judicial Offi cer, despite directions and continuous vigil by the HighCourt. The judgment dated 13.03.2007, which is a public document, iswell discussed and is based upon authoritative materials and was passedin consonance with the doctrine of audi alteram partem. Moreover, it hasa torch bearer eff ect over the facts of the case. Accordingly, judicial noticetaken by the Supreme Court of the inferences, observations and fi ndingsarrived at by the Division Bench and the directions issued in its judgmentdated 13.03.2007 to the extent of the subsequent conduct of the accused,deplorable functioning of the Public Prosecutor, Police Administrationand the Presiding Offi cer of the Trial Court to extend undesirable favourto the accused. [Paras 66, 67 and 68] Evidence Act, 1872 – s.8 – Subsequent conduct of accused – Adverseinference – Maxim “qui sentit commodom, sentire debit et onus.”:Held: In the case in hand, a double murder case, the conduct ofaccused-respondent no.2 was not only relevant u/s.8 of the Evidence Actbut also one of the major circumstances to arrive at a conclusion about hisguilt. Respondent No.2 was instrumental in making all possible eff orts towipe out the evidence against him. The tainted investigation shows thehighhandedness of the Respondent no.2, who was a powerful person, beinga sitting M.P. of the Ruling Party. The question is why the accused wasinstrumental, when he was not guilty of the off ence to which he was beingtried. The obvious answer would be that his guilty mind was fearful aboutthe result. [Paras 70, 72, 73 and 114]Evidence Act, 1872 – s.74 – Bayan Tahriri / Written Statement ofdeceased – Evidentiary value:Held: FIR is a public document defi ned u/s.74 of the Evidence Act. Anypublic document does not stand proven by the mere fact of its production.At the stage of exhibiting any document as a piece of evidence, the truthof what is stated in the document is not considered. It is left open to fi nalevaluation at the trial after cross-examination, and the entire testimony ofthe witness about the existence and contents of the document is weighedin conjunction with various other factors emerging during a trial. Themarking of a piece of evidence as ‘exhibit’ at the stage of evidence in a trialproceeding is only for the purpose of identifi cation of evidence adducedin the trial and for the convenience of the Court and other stakeholders inorder to get a clear picture of what is being produced as evidence in a trialproceeding. In the present case, considering the failure of State machineryand failure of the Trial Court to ensure a fair trial from the perspective ofthe victim side, the aspect of non-marking of the FIR and Bayan Tahririas an exhibit, non-production of the formal witnesses, i.e., the ConstableClerk and Investigating Offi cer to prove the lodging of FIR/Bayan Tahririand fl imsy rejection of application fi led by a person seeking his examinationas a witness along with examination of two persons (who had signed saidwritten statement/Bayan Tahriri as attesting persons) as witnesses in the Trialproceeding do not vitiate the genuineness of the FIR and Bayan Tahriri, andno discount can be given to the accused persons for non-exhibition thereof.[Paras 82, 83, 85, 87 and 89] Evidence Act, 1872 – s.32 – Treatment of FIR /Bayan Tahriri asdying declaration:Held: Statement by an injured person recorded as FIR can be treated asa dying declaration and such a statement is admissible u/s.32 of the EvidenceAct. On facts, the deceased gave his statement in the form of Bayan Tahririand narrated the entire incident and circumstances of the transaction whichresulted in his death. Subsequently, he died on account of injuries suff eredby him in the incident in question. FIR lodged on the basis of Bayan Tahrirof the injured is liable to be treated as a dying declaration, which itself is asubstantive piece of evidence and is admissible u/s.32(1) of the EvidenceAct.

Except in the rarest of rarecases, judicial notice of any fact is generally not taken in criminal mattersin the normal course of proceeding. The present matter falls in the categoryof rarest of rare cases. Certain inferences, observations and fi ndings arrivedat by the Division Bench of High Court in judgment dated 13.03.2007in the Habeas Corpus Petition, have a crucial impact on the merit of thepresent case, as it gives a complete picture as to how the prosecutionversion in the present case was being demolished brick by brick by usingpolitical authority and muscle power with the aid of not only the policeadministration but also with the aid of Public Prosecutor and, the PresidingOffi cer of the Trial Court also conducted himself in a manner unbecomingof a Judicial Offi cer, despite directions and continuous vigil by the HighCourt. The judgment dated 13.03.2007, which is a public document, iswell discussed and is based upon authoritative materials and was passedin consonance with the doctrine of audi alteram partem. Moreover, it hasa torch bearer eff ect over the facts of the case. Accordingly, judicial noticetaken by the Supreme Court of the inferences, observations and fi ndingsarrived at by the Division Bench and the directions issued in its judgmentdated 13.03.2007 to the extent of the subsequent conduct of the accused,deplorable functioning of the Public Prosecutor, Police Administrationand the Presiding Offi cer of the Trial Court to extend undesirable favourto the accused. [Paras 66, 67 and 68] Evidence Act, 1872 – s.8 – Subsequent conduct of accused – Adverseinference – Maxim “qui sentit commodom, sentire debit et onus.”:Held: In the case in hand, a double murder case, the conduct ofaccused-respondent no.2 was not only relevant u/s.8 of the Evidence Actbut also one of the major circumstances to arrive at a conclusion about hisguilt. Respondent No.2 was instrumental in making all possible eff orts towipe out the evidence against him. The tainted investigation shows thehighhandedness of the Respondent no.2, who was a powerful person, beinga sitting M.P. of the Ruling Party. The question is why the accused wasinstrumental, when he was not guilty of the off ence to which he was beingtried. The obvious answer would be that his guilty mind was fearful aboutthe result. [Paras 70, 72, 73 and 114]Evidence Act, 1872 – s.74 – Bayan Tahriri / Written Statement ofdeceased – Evidentiary value:Held: FIR is a public document defi ned u/s.74 of the Evidence Act. Anypublic document does not stand proven by the mere fact of its production.At the stage of exhibiting any document as a piece of evidence, the truthof what is stated in the document is not considered. It is left open to fi nalevaluation at the trial after cross-examination, and the entire testimony ofthe witness about the existence and contents of the document is weighedin conjunction with various other factors emerging during a trial. Themarking of a piece of evidence as ‘exhibit’ at the stage of evidence in a trialproceeding is only for the purpose of identifi cation of evidence adducedin the trial and for the convenience of the Court and other stakeholders inorder to get a clear picture of what is being produced as evidence in a trialproceeding. In the present case, considering the failure of State machineryand failure of the Trial Court to ensure a fair trial from the perspective ofthe victim side, the aspect of non-marking of the FIR and Bayan Tahririas an exhibit, non-production of the formal witnesses, i.e., the ConstableClerk and Investigating Offi cer to prove the lodging of FIR/Bayan Tahririand fl imsy rejection of application fi led by a person seeking his examinationas a witness along with examination of two persons (who had signed saidwritten statement/Bayan Tahriri as attesting persons) as witnesses in the Trialproceeding do not vitiate the genuineness of the FIR and Bayan Tahriri, andno discount can be given to the accused persons for non-exhibition thereof.[Paras 82, 83, 85, 87 and 89] Evidence Act, 1872 – s.32 – Treatment of FIR /Bayan Tahriri asdying declaration:Held: Statement by an injured person recorded as FIR can be treated asa dying declaration and such a statement is admissible u/s.32 of the EvidenceAct. On facts, the deceased gave his statement in the form of Bayan Tahririand narrated the entire incident and circumstances of the transaction whichresulted in his death. Subsequently, he died on account of injuries suff eredby him in the incident in question. FIR lodged on the basis of Bayan Tahrirof the injured is liable to be treated as a dying declaration, which itself is asubstantive piece of evidence and is admissible u/s.32(1) of the EvidenceAct. [Paras 91 and 95]Evidence – Ocular evidence – Testimony of deceased’s mother,an eyewitness, who was abducted by the accused side just before herexamination in the trial court.Held: The High Court ought to have considered the checkered historyof events that occurred in the case, resulting in the judgment of the DivisionBench of the High Court in the Habeas Corpus Petition containing seriousobservations about the conduct of all the stakeholders of the said criminaltrial. CW-1’s fi rst examination was scrapped by the High Court on theallegation of her kidnapping just a few days before that fi rst examinationdated 03.11.2006. She was under continuous threat and fear of facing direconsequence, which is apparent on the face of the record. Under thesecircumstances, in case she had stated in the end of her cross-examination thather son had asked her to take the name of the accused before the Trial Court,there is nothing so contradictory or surprising so as to treat the rest of thesubstantive ocular evidence as tutored one. There is no serious discrepancyor variation in the testimony of CW-1 with regard to the sequence of eventsthat occurred during the incident in question. When the entire family of CW-1was facing so many storms, it is quite natural for a son to say to her mother(who was old, illiterate, rustic woman having faced immense trauma) thatshe should not forget to disclose the name of accused persons, in as much asthe second occasion of her examination, as ordered by the Division Benchof High Court under Section 311 of CrPC, was the last opportunity for herto speak the truth before the Trial Court. There is nothing unusual in thestatement of CW-1. Her statement is found to be reliable, and the Courtsbelow wrongly discarded it on the ground that it was hearsay and tutored.[Paras 101, 102, 103, 104 and 114] Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 – s.311 – Power under – Scope:Held: s.311 CrPC confers wide powers on any court at any stage of anyinquiry, trial or other proceeding under this Code to summon material witnessor examine person present. Such person may not be a person summonedas a witness. Power to recall and re-examine is also vested. The concept isthat it should be essential for the just decision of the case. This power canbe exercised not only by the Trial Court but also by the appellate Court orrevisional Court. The logic behind this provision is that the endeavour of theCourts is to fi nd out the truth which would be essential for the just decisionof the case. [Para 112]Penal Code, 1860 – ss.302 and 307 – Double murder – Due toinjuries caused by fi re arm – Appeal against acquittal.Held: On facts, the post-mortem reports, show that the deaths werehomicidal in nature. The medico legal reports supported the prosecution’sstory to the extent that the injuries were caused by a fi re arm, which provedfatal for two out of the three injured. Fard Bayan registered on oral statementgiven by one of the injured (who died subsequently), which was laterconverted into an FIR, was admissible in evidence and is to be read as adying declaration or his last statement. The prosecution had established, eventhrough the hostile witnesses, that the date, time, and place of incidence asgiven in the Fard Bayan were fully established. Adverse inference againstthe accused is drawn in view of their subsequent conduct. Judicial notice istaken of judgment in the Habeas Corpus petition dated 13.07.2007 regardingthe conduct of the accused, the investigating agency, the Public Prosecutorand the Presiding Offi cer conducting the trial. Statement of CW-1 is foundto be reliable, and the Courts below wrongly discarded it on the groundthat it was hearsay and tutored. The dying declaration and the statement ofCW-1 fully establish that it was Respondent No.2 (accused no.1), who hadcaused the injuries from his fi rearm weapon, which proved to be fatal fortwo out of the three injured and also caused injury to the third survivinginjured. Respondent no.2 thus liable to be convicted under ss.302 and 307IPC. The rest of the accused, although named in the chargesheet after dueinvestigation, since their names were not refl ected either in the Fard Bayanof the deceased (dying declaration) or in the statement of CW1, therefore,their acquittal is not disturbed.

She was under continuous threat and fear of facing direconsequence, which is apparent on the face of the record. Under thesecircumstances, in case she had stated in the end of her cross-examination thather son had asked her to take the name of the accused before the Trial Court,there is nothing so contradictory or surprising so as to treat the rest of thesubstantive ocular evidence as tutored one. There is no serious discrepancyor variation in the testimony of CW-1 with regard to the sequence of eventsthat occurred during the incident in question. When the entire family of CW-1was facing so many storms, it is quite natural for a son to say to her mother(who was old, illiterate, rustic woman having faced immense trauma) thatshe should not forget to disclose the name of accused persons, in as much asthe second occasion of her examination, as ordered by the Division Benchof High Court under Section 311 of CrPC, was the last opportunity for herto speak the truth before the Trial Court. There is nothing unusual in thestatement of CW-1. Her statement is found to be reliable, and the Courtsbelow wrongly discarded it on the ground that it was hearsay and tutored.[Paras 101, 102, 103, 104 and 114] Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 – s.311 – Power under – Scope:Held: s.311 CrPC confers wide powers on any court at any stage of anyinquiry, trial or other proceeding under this Code to summon material witnessor examine person present. Such person may not be a person summonedas a witness. Power to recall and re-examine is also vested. The concept isthat it should be essential for the just decision of the case. This power canbe exercised not only by the Trial Court but also by the appellate Court orrevisional Court. The logic behind this provision is that the endeavour of theCourts is to fi nd out the truth which would be essential for the just decisionof the case. [Para 112]Penal Code, 1860 – ss.302 and 307 – Double murder – Due toinjuries caused by fi re arm – Appeal against acquittal.Held: On facts, the post-mortem reports, show that the deaths werehomicidal in nature. The medico legal reports supported the prosecution’sstory to the extent that the injuries were caused by a fi re arm, which provedfatal for two out of the three injured. Fard Bayan registered on oral statementgiven by one of the injured (who died subsequently), which was laterconverted into an FIR, was admissible in evidence and is to be read as adying declaration or his last statement. The prosecution had established, eventhrough the hostile witnesses, that the date, time, and place of incidence asgiven in the Fard Bayan were fully established. Adverse inference againstthe accused is drawn in view of their subsequent conduct. Judicial notice istaken of judgment in the Habeas Corpus petition dated 13.07.2007 regardingthe conduct of the accused, the investigating agency, the Public Prosecutorand the Presiding Offi cer conducting the trial. Statement of CW-1 is foundto be reliable, and the Courts below wrongly discarded it on the groundthat it was hearsay and tutored. The dying declaration and the statement ofCW-1 fully establish that it was Respondent No.2 (accused no.1), who hadcaused the injuries from his fi rearm weapon, which proved to be fatal fortwo out of the three injured and also caused injury to the third survivinginjured. Respondent no.2 thus liable to be convicted under ss.302 and 307IPC. The rest of the accused, although named in the chargesheet after dueinvestigation, since their names were not refl ected either in the Fard Bayanof the deceased (dying declaration) or in the statement of CW1, therefore,their acquittal is not disturbed.

Except in the rarest of rarecases, judicial notice of any fact is generally not taken in criminal mattersin the normal course of proceeding. The present matter falls in the categoryof rarest of rare cases. Certain inferences, observations and fi ndings arrivedat by the Division Bench of High Court in judgment dated 13.03.2007in the Habeas Corpus Petition, have a crucial impact on the merit of thepresent case, as it gives a complete picture as to how the prosecutionversion in the present case was being demolished brick by brick by usingpolitical authority and muscle power with the aid of not only the policeadministration but also with the aid of Public Prosecutor and, the PresidingOffi cer of the Trial Court also conducted himself in a manner unbecomingof a Judicial Offi cer, despite directions and continuous vigil by the HighCourt. The judgment dated 13.03.2007, which is a public document, iswell discussed and is based upon authoritative materials and was passedin consonance with the doctrine of audi alteram partem. Moreover, it hasa torch bearer eff ect over the facts of the case. Accordingly, judicial noticetaken by the Supreme Court of the inferences, observations and fi ndingsarrived at by the Division Bench and the directions issued in its judgmentdated 13.03.2007 to the extent of the subsequent conduct of the accused,deplorable functioning of the Public Prosecutor, Police Administrationand the Presiding Offi cer of the Trial Court to extend undesirable favourto the accused. [Paras 66, 67 and 68] Evidence Act, 1872 – s.8 – Subsequent conduct of accused – Adverseinference – Maxim “qui sentit commodom, sentire debit et onus.”:Held: In the case in hand, a double murder case, the conduct ofaccused-respondent no.2 was not only relevant u/s.8 of the Evidence Actbut also one of the major circumstances to arrive at a conclusion about hisguilt. Respondent No.2 was instrumental in making all possible eff orts towipe out the evidence against him. The tainted investigation shows thehighhandedness of the Respondent no.2, who was a powerful person, beinga sitting M.P. of the Ruling Party. The question is why the accused wasinstrumental, when he was not guilty of the off ence to which he was beingtried. The obvious answer would be that his guilty mind was fearful aboutthe result. [Paras 70, 72, 73 and 114]Evidence Act, 1872 – s.74 – Bayan Tahriri / Written Statement ofdeceased – Evidentiary value:Held: FIR is a public document defi ned u/s.74 of the Evidence Act. Anypublic document does not stand proven by the mere fact of its production.At the stage of exhibiting any document as a piece of evidence, the truthof what is stated in the document is not considered. It is left open to fi nalevaluation at the trial after cross-examination, and the entire testimony ofthe witness about the existence and contents of the document is weighedin conjunction with various other factors emerging during a trial. Themarking of a piece of evidence as ‘exhibit’ at the stage of evidence in a trialproceeding is only for the purpose of identifi cation of evidence adducedin the trial and for the convenience of the Court and other stakeholders inorder to get a clear picture of what is being produced as evidence in a trialproceeding. In the present case, considering the failure of State machineryand failure of the Trial Court to ensure a fair trial from the perspective ofthe victim side, the aspect of non-marking of the FIR and Bayan Tahririas an exhibit, non-production of the formal witnesses, i.e., the ConstableClerk and Investigating Offi cer to prove the lodging of FIR/Bayan Tahririand fl imsy rejection of application fi led by a person seeking his examinationas a witness along with examination of two persons (who had signed saidwritten statement/Bayan Tahriri as attesting persons) as witnesses in the Trialproceeding do not vitiate the genuineness of the FIR and Bayan Tahriri, andno discount can be given to the accused persons for non-exhibition thereof.[Paras 82, 83, 85, 87 and 89] Evidence Act, 1872 – s.32 – Treatment of FIR /Bayan Tahriri asdying declaration:Held: Statement by an injured person recorded as FIR can be treated asa dying declaration and such a statement is admissible u/s.32 of the EvidenceAct. On facts, the deceased gave his statement in the form of Bayan Tahririand narrated the entire incident and circumstances of the transaction whichresulted in his death. Subsequently, he died on account of injuries suff eredby him in the incident in question. FIR lodged on the basis of Bayan Tahrirof the injured is liable to be treated as a dying declaration, which itself is asubstantive piece of evidence and is admissible u/s.32(1) of the EvidenceAct. [Paras 91 and 95]Evidence – Ocular evidence – Testimony of deceased’s mother,an eyewitness, who was abducted by the accused side just before herexamination in the trial court.Held: The High Court ought to have considered the checkered historyof events that occurred in the case, resulting in the judgment of the DivisionBench of the High Court in the Habeas Corpus Petition containing seriousobservations about the conduct of all the stakeholders of the said criminaltrial.

Except in the rarest of rarecases, judicial notice of any fact is generally not taken in criminal mattersin the normal course of proceeding. The present matter falls in the categoryof rarest of rare cases. Certain inferences, observations and fi ndings arrivedat by the Division Bench of High Court in judgment dated 13.03.2007in the Habeas Corpus Petition, have a crucial impact on the merit of thepresent case, as it gives a complete picture as to how the prosecutionversion in the present case was being demolished brick by brick by usingpolitical authority and muscle power with the aid of not only the policeadministration but also with the aid of Public Prosecutor and, the PresidingOffi cer of the Trial Court also conducted himself in a manner unbecomingof a Judicial Offi cer, despite directions and continuous vigil by the HighCourt. The judgment dated 13.03.2007, which is a public document, iswell discussed and is based upon authoritative materials and was passedin consonance with the doctrine of audi alteram partem. Moreover, it hasa torch bearer eff ect over the facts of the case. Accordingly, judicial noticetaken by the Supreme Court of the inferences, observations and fi ndingsarrived at by the Division Bench and the directions issued in its judgmentdated 13.03.2007 to the extent of the subsequent conduct of the accused,deplorable functioning of the Public Prosecutor, Police Administrationand the Presiding Offi cer of the Trial Court to extend undesirable favourto the accused. [Paras 66, 67 and 68] Evidence Act, 1872 – s.8 – Subsequent conduct of accused – Adverseinference – Maxim “qui sentit commodom, sentire debit et onus.”:Held: In the case in hand, a double murder case, the conduct ofaccused-respondent no.2 was not only relevant u/s.8 of the Evidence Actbut also one of the major circumstances to arrive at a conclusion about hisguilt. Respondent No.2 was instrumental in making all possible eff orts towipe out the evidence against him. The tainted investigation shows thehighhandedness of the Respondent no.2, who was a powerful person, beinga sitting M.P. of the Ruling Party. The question is why the accused wasinstrumental, when he was not guilty of the off ence to which he was beingtried. The obvious answer would be that his guilty mind was fearful aboutthe result. [Paras 70, 72, 73 and 114]Evidence Act, 1872 – s.74 – Bayan Tahriri / Written Statement ofdeceased – Evidentiary value:Held: FIR is a public document defi ned u/s.74 of the Evidence Act. Anypublic document does not stand proven by the mere fact of its production.At the stage of exhibiting any document as a piece of evidence, the truthof what is stated in the document is not considered. It is left open to fi nalevaluation at the trial after cross-examination, and the entire testimony ofthe witness about the existence and contents of the document is weighedin conjunction with various other factors emerging during a trial. Themarking of a piece of evidence as ‘exhibit’ at the stage of evidence in a trialproceeding is only for the purpose of identifi cation of evidence adducedin the trial and for the convenience of the Court and other stakeholders inorder to get a clear picture of what is being produced as evidence in a trialproceeding. In the present case, considering the failure of State machineryand failure of the Trial Court to ensure a fair trial from the perspective ofthe victim side, the aspect of non-marking of the FIR and Bayan Tahririas an exhibit, non-production of the formal witnesses, i.e., the ConstableClerk and Investigating Offi cer to prove the lodging of FIR/Bayan Tahririand fl imsy rejection of application fi led by a person seeking his examinationas a witness along with examination of two persons (who had signed saidwritten statement/Bayan Tahriri as attesting persons) as witnesses in the Trialproceeding do not vitiate the genuineness of the FIR and Bayan Tahriri, andno discount can be given to the accused persons for non-exhibition thereof.[Paras 82, 83, 85, 87 and 89] Evidence Act, 1872 – s.32 – Treatment of FIR /Bayan Tahriri asdying declaration:Held: Statement by an injured person recorded as FIR can be treated asa dying declaration and such a statement is admissible u/s.32 of the EvidenceAct. On facts, the deceased gave his statement in the form of Bayan Tahririand narrated the entire incident and circumstances of the transaction whichresulted in his death. Subsequently, he died on account of injuries suff eredby him in the incident in question. FIR lodged on the basis of Bayan Tahrirof the injured is liable to be treated as a dying declaration, which itself is asubstantive piece of evidence and is admissible u/s.32(1) of the EvidenceAct. [Paras 91 and 95]Evidence – Ocular evidence – Testimony of deceased’s mother,an eyewitness, who was abducted by the accused side just before herexamination in the trial court.Held: The High Court ought to have considered the checkered historyof events that occurred in the case, resulting in the judgment of the DivisionBench of the High Court in the Habeas Corpus Petition containing seriousobservations about the conduct of all the stakeholders of the said criminaltrial. CW-1’s fi rst examination was scrapped by the High Court on theallegation of her kidnapping just a few days before that fi rst examinationdated 03.11.2006. She was under continuous threat and fear of facing direconsequence, which is apparent on the face of the record. Under thesecircumstances, in case she had stated in the end of her cross-examination thather son had asked her to take the name of the accused before the Trial Court,there is nothing so contradictory or surprising so as to treat the rest of thesubstantive ocular evidence as tutored one. There is no serious discrepancyor variation in the testimony of CW-1 with regard to the sequence of eventsthat occurred during the incident in question. When the entire family of CW-1was facing so many storms, it is quite natural for a son to say to her mother(who was old, illiterate, rustic woman having faced immense trauma) thatshe should not forget to disclose the name of accused persons, in as much asthe second occasion of her examination, as ordered by the Division Benchof High Court under Section 311 of CrPC, was the last opportunity for herto speak the truth before the Trial Court. There is nothing unusual in thestatement of CW-1. Her statement is found to be reliable, and the Courtsbelow wrongly discarded it on the ground that it was hearsay and tutored.[Paras 101, 102, 103, 104 and 114] Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 – s.311 – Power under – Scope:Held: s.311 CrPC confers wide powers on any court at any stage of anyinquiry, trial or other proceeding under this Code to summon material witnessor examine person present. Such person may not be a person summonedas a witness. Power to recall and re-examine is also vested. The concept isthat it should be essential for the just decision of the case. This power canbe exercised not only by the Trial Court but also by the appellate Court orrevisional Court. The logic behind this provision is that the endeavour of theCourts is to fi nd out the truth which would be essential for the just decisionof the case. [Para 112]Penal Code, 1860 – ss.302 and 307 – Double murder – Due toinjuries caused by fi re arm – Appeal against acquittal.Held: On facts, the post-mortem reports, show that the deaths werehomicidal in nature. The medico legal reports supported the prosecution’sstory to the extent that the injuries were caused by a fi re arm, which provedfatal for two out of the three injured. Fard Bayan registered on oral statementgiven by one of the injured (who died subsequently), which was laterconverted into an FIR, was admissible in evidence and is to be read as adying declaration or his last statement. The prosecution had established, eventhrough the hostile witnesses, that the date, time, and place of incidence asgiven in the Fard Bayan were fully established. Adverse inference againstthe accused is drawn in view of their subsequent conduct. Judicial notice istaken of judgment in the Habeas Corpus petition dated 13.07.2007 regardingthe conduct of the accused, the investigating agency, the Public Prosecutorand the Presiding Offi cer conducting the trial. Statement of CW-1 is foundto be reliable, and the Courts below wrongly discarded it on the groundthat it was hearsay and tutored. The dying declaration and the statement ofCW-1 fully establish that it was Respondent No.2 (accused no.1), who hadcaused the injuries from his fi rearm weapon, which proved to be fatal fortwo out of the three injured and also caused injury to the third survivinginjured. Respondent no.2 thus liable to be convicted under ss.302 and 307IPC. The rest of the accused, although named in the chargesheet after dueinvestigation, since their names were not refl ected either in the Fard Bayanof the deceased (dying declaration) or in the statement of CW1, therefore,their acquittal is not disturbed.

Her statement is found to be reliable, and the Courtsbelow wrongly discarded it on the ground that it was hearsay and tutored.[Paras 101, 102, 103, 104 and 114] Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 – s.311 – Power under – Scope:Held: s.311 CrPC confers wide powers on any court at any stage of anyinquiry, trial or other proceeding under this Code to summon material witnessor examine person present. Such person may not be a person summonedas a witness. Power to recall and re-examine is also vested. The concept isthat it should be essential for the just decision of the case. This power canbe exercised not only by the Trial Court but also by the appellate Court orrevisional Court. The logic behind this provision is that the endeavour of theCourts is to fi nd out the truth which would be essential for the just decisionof the case. [Para 112]Penal Code, 1860 – ss.302 and 307 – Double murder – Due toinjuries caused by fi re arm – Appeal against acquittal.Held: On facts, the post-mortem reports, show that the deaths werehomicidal in nature. The medico legal reports supported the prosecution’sstory to the extent that the injuries were caused by a fi re arm, which provedfatal for two out of the three injured. Fard Bayan registered on oral statementgiven by one of the injured (who died subsequently), which was laterconverted into an FIR, was admissible in evidence and is to be read as adying declaration or his last statement. The prosecution had established, eventhrough the hostile witnesses, that the date, time, and place of incidence asgiven in the Fard Bayan were fully established. Adverse inference againstthe accused is drawn in view of their subsequent conduct. Judicial notice istaken of judgment in the Habeas Corpus petition dated 13.07.2007 regardingthe conduct of the accused, the investigating agency, the Public Prosecutorand the Presiding Offi cer conducting the trial. Statement of CW-1 is foundto be reliable, and the Courts below wrongly discarded it on the groundthat it was hearsay and tutored. The dying declaration and the statement ofCW-1 fully establish that it was Respondent No.2 (accused no.1), who hadcaused the injuries from his fi rearm weapon, which proved to be fatal fortwo out of the three injured and also caused injury to the third survivinginjured. Respondent no.2 thus liable to be convicted under ss.302 and 307IPC. The rest of the accused, although named in the chargesheet after dueinvestigation, since their names were not refl ected either in the Fard Bayanof the deceased (dying declaration) or in the statement of CW1, therefore,their acquittal is not disturbed.

Except in the rarest of rarecases, judicial notice of any fact is generally not taken in criminal mattersin the normal course of proceeding. The present matter falls in the categoryof rarest of rare cases. Certain inferences, observations and fi ndings arrivedat by the Division Bench of High Court in judgment dated 13.03.2007in the Habeas Corpus Petition, have a crucial impact on the merit of thepresent case, as it gives a complete picture as to how the prosecutionversion in the present case was being demolished brick by brick by usingpolitical authority and muscle power with the aid of not only the policeadministration but also with the aid of Public Prosecutor and, the PresidingOffi cer of the Trial Court also conducted himself in a manner unbecomingof a Judicial Offi cer, despite directions and continuous vigil by the HighCourt. The judgment dated 13.03.2007, which is a public document, iswell discussed and is based upon authoritative materials and was passedin consonance with the doctrine of audi alteram partem. Moreover, it hasa torch bearer eff ect over the facts of the case. Accordingly, judicial noticetaken by the Supreme Court of the inferences, observations and fi ndingsarrived at by the Division Bench and the directions issued in its judgmentdated 13.03.2007 to the extent of the subsequent conduct of the accused,deplorable functioning of the Public Prosecutor, Police Administrationand the Presiding Offi cer of the Trial Court to extend undesirable favourto the accused. [Paras 66, 67 and 68] Evidence Act, 1872 – s.8 – Subsequent conduct of accused – Adverseinference – Maxim “qui sentit commodom, sentire debit et onus.”:Held: In the case in hand, a double murder case, the conduct ofaccused-respondent no.2 was not only relevant u/s.8 of the Evidence Actbut also one of the major circumstances to arrive at a conclusion about hisguilt. Respondent No.2 was instrumental in making all possible eff orts towipe out the evidence against him. The tainted investigation shows thehighhandedness of the Respondent no.2, who was a powerful person, beinga sitting M.P. of the Ruling Party. The question is why the accused wasinstrumental, when he was not guilty of the off ence to which he was beingtried. The obvious answer would be that his guilty mind was fearful aboutthe result. [Paras 70, 72, 73 and 114]Evidence Act, 1872 – s.74 – Bayan Tahriri / Written Statement ofdeceased – Evidentiary value:Held: FIR is a public document defi ned u/s.74 of the Evidence Act. Anypublic document does not stand proven by the mere fact of its production.At the stage of exhibiting any document as a piece of evidence, the truthof what is stated in the document is not considered. It is left open to fi nalevaluation at the trial after cross-examination, and the entire testimony ofthe witness about the existence and contents of the document is weighedin conjunction with various other factors emerging during a trial. Themarking of a piece of evidence as ‘exhibit’ at the stage of evidence in a trialproceeding is only for the purpose of identifi cation of evidence adducedin the trial and for the convenience of the Court and other stakeholders inorder to get a clear picture of what is being produced as evidence in a trialproceeding. In the present case, considering the failure of State machineryand failure of the Trial Court to ensure a fair trial from the perspective ofthe victim side, the aspect of non-marking of the FIR and Bayan Tahririas an exhibit, non-production of the formal witnesses, i.e., the ConstableClerk and Investigating Offi cer to prove the lodging of FIR/Bayan Tahririand fl imsy rejection of application fi led by a person seeking his examinationas a witness along with examination of two persons (who had signed saidwritten statement/Bayan Tahriri as attesting persons) as witnesses in the Trialproceeding do not vitiate the genuineness of the FIR and Bayan Tahriri, andno discount can be given to the accused persons for non-exhibition thereof.[Paras 82, 83, 85, 87 and 89] Evidence Act, 1872 – s.32 – Treatment of FIR /Bayan Tahriri asdying declaration:Held: Statement by an injured person recorded as FIR can be treated asa dying declaration and such a statement is admissible u/s.32 of the EvidenceAct. On facts, the deceased gave his statement in the form of Bayan Tahririand narrated the entire incident and circumstances of the transaction whichresulted in his death. Subsequently, he died on account of injuries suff eredby him in the incident in question. FIR lodged on the basis of Bayan Tahrirof the injured is liable to be treated as a dying declaration, which itself is asubstantive piece of evidence and is admissible u/s.32(1) of the EvidenceAct. [Paras 91 and 95]Evidence – Ocular evidence – Testimony of deceased’s mother,an eyewitness, who was abducted by the accused side just before herexamination in the trial court.Held: The High Court ought to have considered the checkered historyof events that occurred in the case, resulting in the judgment of the DivisionBench of the High Court in the Habeas Corpus Petition containing seriousobservations about the conduct of all the stakeholders of the said criminaltrial. CW-1’s fi rst examination was scrapped by the High Court on theallegation of her kidnapping just a few days before that fi rst examinationdated 03.11.2006. She was under continuous threat and fear of facing direconsequence, which is apparent on the face of the record. Under thesecircumstances, in case she had stated in the end of her cross-examination thather son had asked her to take the name of the accused before the Trial Court,there is nothing so contradictory or surprising so as to treat the rest of thesubstantive ocular evidence as tutored one. There is no serious discrepancyor variation in the testimony of CW-1 with regard to the sequence of eventsthat occurred during the incident in question. When the entire family of CW-1was facing so many storms, it is quite natural for a son to say to her mother(who was old, illiterate, rustic woman having faced immense trauma) thatshe should not forget to disclose the name of accused persons, in as much asthe second occasion of her examination, as ordered by the Division Benchof High Court under Section 311 of CrPC, was the last opportunity for herto speak the truth before the Trial Court. There is nothing unusual in thestatement of CW-1. Her statement is found to be reliable, and the Courtsbelow wrongly discarded it on the ground that it was hearsay and tutored.[Paras 101, 102, 103, 104 and 114] Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 – s.311 – Power under – Scope:Held: s.311 CrPC confers wide powers on any court at any stage of anyinquiry, trial or other proceeding under this Code to summon material witnessor examine person present.

[Para 112]Penal Code, 1860 – ss.302 and 307 – Double murder – Due toinjuries caused by fi re arm – Appeal against acquittal.Held: On facts, the post-mortem reports, show that the deaths werehomicidal in nature. The medico legal reports supported the prosecution’sstory to the extent that the injuries were caused by a fi re arm, which provedfatal for two out of the three injured. Fard Bayan registered on oral statementgiven by one of the injured (who died subsequently), which was laterconverted into an FIR, was admissible in evidence and is to be read as adying declaration or his last statement.

Except in the rarest of rarecases, judicial notice of any fact is generally not taken in criminal mattersin the normal course of proceeding. The present matter falls in the categoryof rarest of rare cases. Certain inferences, observations and fi ndings arrivedat by the Division Bench of High Court in judgment dated 13.03.2007in the Habeas Corpus Petition, have a crucial impact on the merit of thepresent case, as it gives a complete picture as to how the prosecutionversion in the present case was being demolished brick by brick by usingpolitical authority and muscle power with the aid of not only the policeadministration but also with the aid of Public Prosecutor and, the PresidingOffi cer of the Trial Court also conducted himself in a manner unbecomingof a Judicial Offi cer, despite directions and continuous vigil by the HighCourt. The judgment dated 13.03.2007, which is a public document, iswell discussed and is based upon authoritative materials and was passedin consonance with the doctrine of audi alteram partem. Moreover, it hasa torch bearer eff ect over the facts of the case. Accordingly, judicial noticetaken by the Supreme Court of the inferences, observations and fi ndingsarrived at by the Division Bench and the directions issued in its judgmentdated 13.03.2007 to the extent of the subsequent conduct of the accused,deplorable functioning of the Public Prosecutor, Police Administrationand the Presiding Offi cer of the Trial Court to extend undesirable favourto the accused. [Paras 66, 67 and 68] Evidence Act, 1872 – s.8 – Subsequent conduct of accused – Adverseinference – Maxim “qui sentit commodom, sentire debit et onus.”:Held: In the case in hand, a double murder case, the conduct ofaccused-respondent no.2 was not only relevant u/s.8 of the Evidence Actbut also one of the major circumstances to arrive at a conclusion about hisguilt. Respondent No.2 was instrumental in making all possible eff orts towipe out the evidence against him. The tainted investigation shows thehighhandedness of the Respondent no.2, who was a powerful person, beinga sitting M.P. of the Ruling Party. The question is why the accused wasinstrumental, when he was not guilty of the off ence to which he was beingtried. The obvious answer would be that his guilty mind was fearful aboutthe result. [Paras 70, 72, 73 and 114]Evidence Act, 1872 – s.74 – Bayan Tahriri / Written Statement ofdeceased – Evidentiary value:Held: FIR is a public document defi ned u/s.74 of the Evidence Act. Anypublic document does not stand proven by the mere fact of its production.At the stage of exhibiting any document as a piece of evidence, the truthof what is stated in the document is not considered. It is left open to fi nalevaluation at the trial after cross-examination, and the entire testimony ofthe witness about the existence and contents of the document is weighedin conjunction with various other factors emerging during a trial. Themarking of a piece of evidence as ‘exhibit’ at the stage of evidence in a trialproceeding is only for the purpose of identifi cation of evidence adducedin the trial and for the convenience of the Court and other stakeholders inorder to get a clear picture of what is being produced as evidence in a trialproceeding. In the present case, considering the failure of State machineryand failure of the Trial Court to ensure a fair trial from the perspective ofthe victim side, the aspect of non-marking of the FIR and Bayan Tahririas an exhibit, non-production of the formal witnesses, i.e., the ConstableClerk and Investigating Offi cer to prove the lodging of FIR/Bayan Tahririand fl imsy rejection of application fi led by a person seeking his examinationas a witness along with examination of two persons (who had signed saidwritten statement/Bayan Tahriri as attesting persons) as witnesses in the Trialproceeding do not vitiate the genuineness of the FIR and Bayan Tahriri, andno discount can be given to the accused persons for non-exhibition thereof.[Paras 82, 83, 85, 87 and 89] Evidence Act, 1872 – s.32 – Treatment of FIR /Bayan Tahriri asdying declaration:Held: Statement by an injured person recorded as FIR can be treated asa dying declaration and such a statement is admissible u/s.32 of the EvidenceAct. On facts, the deceased gave his statement in the form of Bayan Tahririand narrated the entire incident and circumstances of the transaction whichresulted in his death. Subsequently, he died on account of injuries suff eredby him in the incident in question. FIR lodged on the basis of Bayan Tahrirof the injured is liable to be treated as a dying declaration, which itself is asubstantive piece of evidence and is admissible u/s.32(1) of the EvidenceAct. [Paras 91 and 95]Evidence – Ocular evidence – Testimony of deceased’s mother,an eyewitness, who was abducted by the accused side just before herexamination in the trial court.Held: The High Court ought to have considered the checkered historyof events that occurred in the case, resulting in the judgment of the DivisionBench of the High Court in the Habeas Corpus Petition containing seriousobservations about the conduct of all the stakeholders of the said criminaltrial. CW-1’s fi rst examination was scrapped by the High Court on theallegation of her kidnapping just a few days before that fi rst examinationdated 03.11.2006. She was under continuous threat and fear of facing direconsequence, which is apparent on the face of the record. Under thesecircumstances, in case she had stated in the end of her cross-examination thather son had asked her to take the name of the accused before the Trial Court,there is nothing so contradictory or surprising so as to treat the rest of thesubstantive ocular evidence as tutored one. There is no serious discrepancyor variation in the testimony of CW-1 with regard to the sequence of eventsthat occurred during the incident in question. When the entire family of CW-1was facing so many storms, it is quite natural for a son to say to her mother(who was old, illiterate, rustic woman having faced immense trauma) thatshe should not forget to disclose the name of accused persons, in as much asthe second occasion of her examination, as ordered by the Division Benchof High Court under Section 311 of CrPC, was the last opportunity for herto speak the truth before the Trial Court. There is nothing unusual in thestatement of CW-1. Her statement is found to be reliable, and the Courtsbelow wrongly discarded it on the ground that it was hearsay and tutored.[Paras 101, 102, 103, 104 and 114] Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 – s.311 – Power under – Scope:Held: s.311 CrPC confers wide powers on any court at any stage of anyinquiry, trial or other proceeding under this Code to summon material witnessor examine person present. Such person may not be a person summonedas a witness. Power to recall and re-examine is also vested. The concept isthat it should be essential for the just decision of the case. This power canbe exercised not only by the Trial Court but also by the appellate Court orrevisional Court. The logic behind this provision is that the endeavour of theCourts is to fi nd out the truth which would be essential for the just decisionof the case. [Para 112]Penal Code, 1860 – ss.302 and 307 – Double murder – Due toinjuries caused by fi re arm – Appeal against acquittal.Held: On facts, the post-mortem reports, show that the deaths werehomicidal in nature. The medico legal reports supported the prosecution’sstory to the extent that the injuries were caused by a fi re arm, which provedfatal for two out of the three injured. Fard Bayan registered on oral statementgiven by one of the injured (who died subsequently), which was laterconverted into an FIR, was admissible in evidence and is to be read as adying declaration or his last statement. The prosecution had established, eventhrough the hostile witnesses, that the date, time, and place of incidence asgiven in the Fard Bayan were fully established. Adverse inference againstthe accused is drawn in view of their subsequent conduct. Judicial notice istaken of judgment in the Habeas Corpus petition dated 13.07.2007 regardingthe conduct of the accused, the investigating agency, the Public Prosecutorand the Presiding Offi cer conducting the trial. Statement of CW-1 is foundto be reliable, and the Courts below wrongly discarded it on the groundthat it was hearsay and tutored. The dying declaration and the statement ofCW-1 fully establish that it was Respondent No.2 (accused no.1), who hadcaused the injuries from his fi rearm weapon, which proved to be fatal fortwo out of the three injured and also caused injury to the third survivinginjured. Respondent no.2 thus liable to be convicted under ss.302 and 307IPC. The rest of the accused, although named in the chargesheet after dueinvestigation, since their names were not refl ected either in the Fard Bayanof the deceased (dying declaration) or in the statement of CW1, therefore,their acquittal is not disturbed.

[Paras 91 and 95]Evidence – Ocular evidence – Testimony of deceased’s mother,an eyewitness, who was abducted by the accused side just before herexamination in the trial court.Held: The High Court ought to have considered the checkered historyof events that occurred in the case, resulting in the judgment of the DivisionBench of the High Court in the Habeas Corpus Petition containing seriousobservations about the conduct of all the stakeholders of the said criminaltrial. CW-1’s fi rst examination was scrapped by the High Court on theallegation of her kidnapping just a few days before that fi rst examinationdated 03.11.2006. She was under continuous threat and fear of facing direconsequence, which is apparent on the face of the record. Under thesecircumstances, in case she had stated in the end of her cross-examination thather son had asked her to take the name of the accused before the Trial Court,there is nothing so contradictory or surprising so as to treat the rest of thesubstantive ocular evidence as tutored one. There is no serious discrepancyor variation in the testimony of CW-1 with regard to the sequence of eventsthat occurred during the incident in question. When the entire family of CW-1was facing so many storms, it is quite natural for a son to say to her mother(who was old, illiterate, rustic woman having faced immense trauma) thatshe should not forget to disclose the name of accused persons, in as much asthe second occasion of her examination, as ordered by the Division Benchof High Court under Section 311 of CrPC, was the last opportunity for herto speak the truth before the Trial Court. There is nothing unusual in thestatement of CW-1. Her statement is found to be reliable, and the Courtsbelow wrongly discarded it on the ground that it was hearsay and tutored.[Paras 101, 102, 103, 104 and 114] Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 – s.311 – Power under – Scope:Held: s.311 CrPC confers wide powers on any court at any stage of anyinquiry, trial or other proceeding under this Code to summon material witnessor examine person present. Such person may not be a person summonedas a witness. Power to recall and re-examine is also vested. The concept isthat it should be essential for the just decision of the case. This power canbe exercised not only by the Trial Court but also by the appellate Court orrevisional Court. The logic behind this provision is that the endeavour of theCourts is to fi nd out the truth which would be essential for the just decisionof the case. [Para 112]Penal Code, 1860 – ss.302 and 307 – Double murder – Due toinjuries caused by fi re arm – Appeal against acquittal.Held: On facts, the post-mortem reports, show that the deaths werehomicidal in nature. The medico legal reports supported the prosecution’sstory to the extent that the injuries were caused by a fi re arm, which provedfatal for two out of the three injured. Fard Bayan registered on oral statementgiven by one of the injured (who died subsequently), which was laterconverted into an FIR, was admissible in evidence and is to be read as adying declaration or his last statement. The prosecution had established, eventhrough the hostile witnesses, that the date, time, and place of incidence asgiven in the Fard Bayan were fully established. Adverse inference againstthe accused is drawn in view of their subsequent conduct. Judicial notice istaken of judgment in the Habeas Corpus petition dated 13.07.2007 regardingthe conduct of the accused, the investigating agency, the Public Prosecutorand the Presiding Offi cer conducting the trial. Statement of CW-1 is foundto be reliable, and the Courts below wrongly discarded it on the groundthat it was hearsay and tutored. The dying declaration and the statement ofCW-1 fully establish that it was Respondent No.2 (accused no.1), who hadcaused the injuries from his fi rearm weapon, which proved to be fatal fortwo out of the three injured and also caused injury to the third survivinginjured. Respondent no.2 thus liable to be convicted under ss.302 and 307IPC. The rest of the accused, although named in the chargesheet after dueinvestigation, since their names were not refl ected either in the Fard Bayanof the deceased (dying declaration) or in the statement of CW1, therefore,their acquittal is not disturbed.

        "HeadNote": "Issues for consideration: In a double murder case, wherein it wasalleged that accused no.1-respondent no.2 had opened fi re from his rifl eresulting in injury to three persons, out of which two died, and the trial courthad acquitted accused-respondent nos. 2 to 8 of all the charges, which wasconfi rmed by the High Court in criminal revision, the issues before thisCourt were:(i) Whether the Supreme Court, in appeal against acquittal, couldconsider the High Court’s judgment dated 13.03.2007 passed in a HabeasCorpus Writ Petition (fi led pursuant to abduction of CW1, mother of oneof the deceased, ten days before the date fi xed for recording her statement),which was not part of the evidence produced (although it was part of theTrial Court record) and was not relied upon by the prosecution before theTrial Court, as a piece of incriminating evidence in the nature of a PublicDocument and, if yes, up to what extent.(ii) Whether the previous or subsequent conduct of the accused,established on record, can be treated as a circumstance against the accusedin view of Section 8 of the Evidence Act.(iii) Whether the FIR or Bayan Tahriri can be said to be proved as apiece of reliable prosecution evidence and if so, what would be the position oflaw on the issue of treating the FIR or Bayan Tahriri as the Dying Declaration.(iv) Whether the testimony of CW1 (an old feeble, rustic, illiteratelady and mother of the deceased and an eyewitness of the incident), who stated in the end of her cross-examination that “her son (another alive son)had asked her to take the name of accused before the Court,” can be treatedto be a reliable evidence against such accused, especially in view of thecheckered and abnormal history of the case.Evidence Act, 1872 – s.56 – Doctrine of judicial notice – JudicialNotice of fact in criminal matters – Maxim “res judicata pro veritateaccipitur”.Administration of Criminal Justice – Failure of three mainstakeholders in a criminal trial – Undesirable favour to accused – Pathdiff erent from the normal adopted to determine guilt of the accused.Held: Doctrine of judicial notice, as provided u/s.56 of the EvidenceAct, is an exception to general rules of evidence applicable for proving anyfact by adducing evidence in the Court of law. Except in the rarest of rarecases, judicial notice of any fact is generally not taken in criminal mattersin the normal course of proceeding. The present matter falls in the categoryof rarest of rare cases. Certain inferences, observations and fi ndings arrivedat by the Division Bench of High Court in judgment dated 13.03.2007in the Habeas Corpus Petition, have a crucial impact on the merit of thepresent case, as it gives a complete picture as to how the prosecutionversion in the present case was being demolished brick by brick by usingpolitical authority and muscle power with the aid of not only the policeadministration but also with the aid of Public Prosecutor and, the PresidingOffi cer of the Trial Court also conducted himself in a manner unbecomingof a Judicial Offi cer, despite directions and continuous vigil by the HighCourt. The judgment dated 13.03.2007, which is a public document, iswell discussed and is based upon authoritative materials and was passedin consonance with the doctrine of audi alteram partem. Moreover, it hasa torch bearer eff ect over the facts of the case. Accordingly, judicial noticetaken by the Supreme Court of the inferences, observations and fi ndingsarrived at by the Division Bench and the directions issued in its judgmentdated 13.03.2007 to the extent of the subsequent conduct of the accused,deplorable functioning of the Public Prosecutor, Police Administrationand the Presiding Offi cer of the Trial Court to extend undesirable favourto the accused. [Paras 66, 67 and 68] Evidence Act, 1872 – s.8 – Subsequent conduct of accused – Adverseinference – Maxim “qui sentit commodom, sentire debit et onus.”:Held: In the case in hand, a double murder case, the conduct ofaccused-respondent no.2 was not only relevant u/s.8 of the Evidence Actbut also one of the major circumstances to arrive at a conclusion about hisguilt. Respondent No.2 was instrumental in making all possible eff orts towipe out the evidence against him. The tainted investigation shows thehighhandedness of the Respondent no.2, who was a powerful person, beinga sitting M.P. of the Ruling Party. The question is why the accused wasinstrumental, when he was not guilty of the off ence to which he was beingtried. The obvious answer would be that his guilty mind was fearful aboutthe result. [Paras 70, 72, 73 and 114]Evidence Act, 1872 – s.74 – Bayan Tahriri / Written Statement ofdeceased – Evidentiary value:Held: FIR is a public document defi ned u/s.74 of the Evidence Act. Anypublic document does not stand proven by the mere fact of its production.At the stage of exhibiting any document as a piece of evidence, the truthof what is stated in the document is not considered. It is left open to fi nalevaluation at the trial after cross-examination, and the entire testimony ofthe witness about the existence and contents of the document is weighedin conjunction with various other factors emerging during a trial. Themarking of a piece of evidence as ‘exhibit’ at the stage of evidence in a trialproceeding is only for the purpose of identifi cation of evidence adducedin the trial and for the convenience of the Court and other stakeholders inorder to get a clear picture of what is being produced as evidence in a trialproceeding. In the present case, considering the failure of State machineryand failure of the Trial Court to ensure a fair trial from the perspective ofthe victim side, the aspect of non-marking of the FIR and Bayan Tahririas an exhibit, non-production of the formal witnesses, i.e., the ConstableClerk and Investigating Offi cer to prove the lodging of FIR/Bayan Tahririand fl imsy rejection of application fi led by a person seeking his examinationas a witness along with examination of two persons (who had signed saidwritten statement/Bayan Tahriri as attesting persons) as witnesses in the Trialproceeding do not vitiate the genuineness of the FIR and Bayan Tahriri, andno discount can be given to the accused persons for non-exhibition thereof.[Paras 82, 83, 85, 87 and 89] Evidence Act, 1872 – s.32 – Treatment of FIR /Bayan Tahriri asdying declaration:Held: Statement by an injured person recorded as FIR can be treated asa dying declaration and such a statement is admissible u/s.32 of the EvidenceAct. On facts, the deceased gave his statement in the form of Bayan Tahririand narrated the entire incident and circumstances of the transaction whichresulted in his death. Subsequently, he died on account of injuries suff eredby him in the incident in question. FIR lodged on the basis of Bayan Tahrirof the injured is liable to be treated as a dying declaration, which itself is asubstantive piece of evidence and is admissible u/s.32(1) of the EvidenceAct.

Except in the rarest of rarecases, judicial notice of any fact is generally not taken in criminal mattersin the normal course of proceeding. The present matter falls in the categoryof rarest of rare cases. Certain inferences, observations and fi ndings arrivedat by the Division Bench of High Court in judgment dated 13.03.2007in the Habeas Corpus Petition, have a crucial impact on the merit of thepresent case, as it gives a complete picture as to how the prosecutionversion in the present case was being demolished brick by brick by usingpolitical authority and muscle power with the aid of not only the policeadministration but also with the aid of Public Prosecutor and, the PresidingOffi cer of the Trial Court also conducted himself in a manner unbecomingof a Judicial Offi cer, despite directions and continuous vigil by the HighCourt. The judgment dated 13.03.2007, which is a public document, iswell discussed and is based upon authoritative materials and was passedin consonance with the doctrine of audi alteram partem. Moreover, it hasa torch bearer eff ect over the facts of the case. Accordingly, judicial noticetaken by the Supreme Court of the inferences, observations and fi ndingsarrived at by the Division Bench and the directions issued in its judgmentdated 13.03.2007 to the extent of the subsequent conduct of the accused,deplorable functioning of the Public Prosecutor, Police Administrationand the Presiding Offi cer of the Trial Court to extend undesirable favourto the accused. [Paras 66, 67 and 68] Evidence Act, 1872 – s.8 – Subsequent conduct of accused – Adverseinference – Maxim “qui sentit commodom, sentire debit et onus.”:Held: In the case in hand, a double murder case, the conduct ofaccused-respondent no.2 was not only relevant u/s.8 of the Evidence Actbut also one of the major circumstances to arrive at a conclusion about hisguilt. Respondent No.2 was instrumental in making all possible eff orts towipe out the evidence against him. The tainted investigation shows thehighhandedness of the Respondent no.2, who was a powerful person, beinga sitting M.P. of the Ruling Party. The question is why the accused wasinstrumental, when he was not guilty of the off ence to which he was beingtried. The obvious answer would be that his guilty mind was fearful aboutthe result. [Paras 70, 72, 73 and 114]Evidence Act, 1872 – s.74 – Bayan Tahriri / Written Statement ofdeceased – Evidentiary value:Held: FIR is a public document defi ned u/s.74 of the Evidence Act. Anypublic document does not stand proven by the mere fact of its production.At the stage of exhibiting any document as a piece of evidence, the truthof what is stated in the document is not considered. It is left open to fi nalevaluation at the trial after cross-examination, and the entire testimony ofthe witness about the existence and contents of the document is weighedin conjunction with various other factors emerging during a trial. Themarking of a piece of evidence as ‘exhibit’ at the stage of evidence in a trialproceeding is only for the purpose of identifi cation of evidence adducedin the trial and for the convenience of the Court and other stakeholders inorder to get a clear picture of what is being produced as evidence in a trialproceeding. In the present case, considering the failure of State machineryand failure of the Trial Court to ensure a fair trial from the perspective ofthe victim side, the aspect of non-marking of the FIR and Bayan Tahririas an exhibit, non-production of the formal witnesses, i.e., the ConstableClerk and Investigating Offi cer to prove the lodging of FIR/Bayan Tahririand fl imsy rejection of application fi led by a person seeking his examinationas a witness along with examination of two persons (who had signed saidwritten statement/Bayan Tahriri as attesting persons) as witnesses in the Trialproceeding do not vitiate the genuineness of the FIR and Bayan Tahriri, andno discount can be given to the accused persons for non-exhibition thereof.[Paras 82, 83, 85, 87 and 89] Evidence Act, 1872 – s.32 – Treatment of FIR /Bayan Tahriri asdying declaration:Held: Statement by an injured person recorded as FIR can be treated asa dying declaration and such a statement is admissible u/s.32 of the EvidenceAct. On facts, the deceased gave his statement in the form of Bayan Tahririand narrated the entire incident and circumstances of the transaction whichresulted in his death. Subsequently, he died on account of injuries suff eredby him in the incident in question. FIR lodged on the basis of Bayan Tahrirof the injured is liable to be treated as a dying declaration, which itself is asubstantive piece of evidence and is admissible u/s.32(1) of the EvidenceAct. [Paras 91 and 95]Evidence – Ocular evidence – Testimony of deceased’s mother,an eyewitness, who was abducted by the accused side just before herexamination in the trial court.Held: The High Court ought to have considered the checkered historyof events that occurred in the case, resulting in the judgment of the DivisionBench of the High Court in the Habeas Corpus Petition containing seriousobservations about the conduct of all the stakeholders of the said criminaltrial. CW-1’s fi rst examination was scrapped by the High Court on theallegation of her kidnapping just a few days before that fi rst examinationdated 03.11.2006. She was under continuous threat and fear of facing direconsequence, which is apparent on the face of the record. Under thesecircumstances, in case she had stated in the end of her cross-examination thather son had asked her to take the name of the accused before the Trial Court,there is nothing so contradictory or surprising so as to treat the rest of thesubstantive ocular evidence as tutored one. There is no serious discrepancyor variation in the testimony of CW-1 with regard to the sequence of eventsthat occurred during the incident in question. When the entire family of CW-1was facing so many storms, it is quite natural for a son to say to her mother(who was old, illiterate, rustic woman having faced immense trauma) thatshe should not forget to disclose the name of accused persons, in as much asthe second occasion of her examination, as ordered by the Division Benchof High Court under Section 311 of CrPC, was the last opportunity for herto speak the truth before the Trial Court. There is nothing unusual in thestatement of CW-1. Her statement is found to be reliable, and the Courtsbelow wrongly discarded it on the ground that it was hearsay and tutored.[Paras 101, 102, 103, 104 and 114] Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 – s.311 – Power under – Scope:Held: s.311 CrPC confers wide powers on any court at any stage of anyinquiry, trial or other proceeding under this Code to summon material witnessor examine person present. Such person may not be a person summonedas a witness. Power to recall and re-examine is also vested. The concept isthat it should be essential for the just decision of the case. This power canbe exercised not only by the Trial Court but also by the appellate Court orrevisional Court. The logic behind this provision is that the endeavour of theCourts is to fi nd out the truth which would be essential for the just decisionof the case. [Para 112]Penal Code, 1860 – ss.302 and 307 – Double murder – Due toinjuries caused by fi re arm – Appeal against acquittal.Held: On facts, the post-mortem reports, show that the deaths werehomicidal in nature. The medico legal reports supported the prosecution’sstory to the extent that the injuries were caused by a fi re arm, which provedfatal for two out of the three injured. Fard Bayan registered on oral statementgiven by one of the injured (who died subsequently), which was laterconverted into an FIR, was admissible in evidence and is to be read as adying declaration or his last statement. The prosecution had established, eventhrough the hostile witnesses, that the date, time, and place of incidence asgiven in the Fard Bayan were fully established. Adverse inference againstthe accused is drawn in view of their subsequent conduct. Judicial notice istaken of judgment in the Habeas Corpus petition dated 13.07.2007 regardingthe conduct of the accused, the investigating agency, the Public Prosecutorand the Presiding Offi cer conducting the trial. Statement of CW-1 is foundto be reliable, and the Courts below wrongly discarded it on the groundthat it was hearsay and tutored. The dying declaration and the statement ofCW-1 fully establish that it was Respondent No.2 (accused no.1), who hadcaused the injuries from his fi rearm weapon, which proved to be fatal fortwo out of the three injured and also caused injury to the third survivinginjured. Respondent no.2 thus liable to be convicted under ss.302 and 307IPC. The rest of the accused, although named in the chargesheet after dueinvestigation, since their names were not refl ected either in the Fard Bayanof the deceased (dying declaration) or in the statement of CW1, therefore,their acquittal is not disturbed.

        "HeadNote": "Issues for consideration: In a double murder case, wherein it wasalleged that accused no.1-respondent no.2 had opened fi re from his rifl eresulting in injury to three persons, out of which two died, and the trial courthad acquitted accused-respondent nos. 2 to 8 of all the charges, which wasconfi rmed by the High Court in criminal revision, the issues before thisCourt were:(i) Whether the Supreme Court, in appeal against acquittal, couldconsider the High Court’s judgment dated 13.03.2007 passed in a HabeasCorpus Writ Petition (fi led pursuant to abduction of CW1, mother of oneof the deceased, ten days before the date fi xed for recording her statement),which was not part of the evidence produced (although it was part of theTrial Court record) and was not relied upon by the prosecution before theTrial Court, as a piece of incriminating evidence in the nature of a PublicDocument and, if yes, up to what extent.(ii) Whether the previous or subsequent conduct of the accused,established on record, can be treated as a circumstance against the accusedin view of Section 8 of the Evidence Act.(iii) Whether the FIR or Bayan Tahriri can be said to be proved as apiece of reliable prosecution evidence and if so, what would be the position oflaw on the issue of treating the FIR or Bayan Tahriri as the Dying Declaration.(iv) Whether the testimony of CW1 (an old feeble, rustic, illiteratelady and mother of the deceased and an eyewitness of the incident), who stated in the end of her cross-examination that “her son (another alive son)had asked her to take the name of accused before the Court,” can be treatedto be a reliable evidence against such accused, especially in view of thecheckered and abnormal history of the case.Evidence Act, 1872 – s.56 – Doctrine of judicial notice – JudicialNotice of fact in criminal matters – Maxim “res judicata pro veritateaccipitur”.Administration of Criminal Justice – Failure of three mainstakeholders in a criminal trial – Undesirable favour to accused – Pathdiff erent from the normal adopted to determine guilt of the accused.Held: Doctrine of judicial notice, as provided u/s.56 of the EvidenceAct, is an exception to general rules of evidence applicable for proving anyfact by adducing evidence in the Court of law. Except in the rarest of rarecases, judicial notice of any fact is generally not taken in criminal mattersin the normal course of proceeding. The present matter falls in the categoryof rarest of rare cases. Certain inferences, observations and fi ndings arrivedat by the Division Bench of High Court in judgment dated 13.03.2007in the Habeas Corpus Petition, have a crucial impact on the merit of thepresent case, as it gives a complete picture as to how the prosecutionversion in the present case was being demolished brick by brick by usingpolitical authority and muscle power with the aid of not only the policeadministration but also with the aid of Public Prosecutor and, the PresidingOffi cer of the Trial Court also conducted himself in a manner unbecomingof a Judicial Offi cer, despite directions and continuous vigil by the HighCourt. The judgment dated 13.03.2007, which is a public document, iswell discussed and is based upon authoritative materials and was passedin consonance with the doctrine of audi alteram partem. Moreover, it hasa torch bearer eff ect over the facts of the case. Accordingly, judicial noticetaken by the Supreme Court of the inferences, observations and fi ndingsarrived at by the Division Bench and the directions issued in its judgmentdated 13.03.2007 to the extent of the subsequent conduct of the accused,deplorable functioning of the Public Prosecutor, Police Administrationand the Presiding Offi cer of the Trial Court to extend undesirable favourto the accused. [Paras 66, 67 and 68] Evidence Act, 1872 – s.8 – Subsequent conduct of accused – Adverseinference – Maxim “qui sentit commodom, sentire debit et onus.”:Held: In the case in hand, a double murder case, the conduct ofaccused-respondent no.2 was not only relevant u/s.8 of the Evidence Actbut also one of the major circumstances to arrive at a conclusion about hisguilt. Respondent No.2 was instrumental in making all possible eff orts towipe out the evidence against him. The tainted investigation shows thehighhandedness of the Respondent no.2, who was a powerful person, beinga sitting M.P. of the Ruling Party. The question is why the accused wasinstrumental, when he was not guilty of the off ence to which he was beingtried. The obvious answer would be that his guilty mind was fearful aboutthe result. [Paras 70, 72, 73 and 114]Evidence Act, 1872 – s.74 – Bayan Tahriri / Written Statement ofdeceased – Evidentiary value:Held: FIR is a public document defi ned u/s.74 of the Evidence Act. Anypublic document does not stand proven by the mere fact of its production.At the stage of exhibiting any document as a piece of evidence, the truthof what is stated in the document is not considered. It is left open to fi nalevaluation at the trial after cross-examination, and the entire testimony ofthe witness about the existence and contents of the document is weighedin conjunction with various other factors emerging during a trial. Themarking of a piece of evidence as ‘exhibit’ at the stage of evidence in a trialproceeding is only for the purpose of identifi cation of evidence adducedin the trial and for the convenience of the Court and other stakeholders inorder to get a clear picture of what is being produced as evidence in a trialproceeding. In the present case, considering the failure of State machineryand failure of the Trial Court to ensure a fair trial from the perspective ofthe victim side, the aspect of non-marking of the FIR and Bayan Tahririas an exhibit, non-production of the formal witnesses, i.e., the ConstableClerk and Investigating Offi cer to prove the lodging of FIR/Bayan Tahririand fl imsy rejection of application fi led by a person seeking his examinationas a witness along with examination of two persons (who had signed saidwritten statement/Bayan Tahriri as attesting persons) as witnesses in the Trialproceeding do not vitiate the genuineness of the FIR and Bayan Tahriri, andno discount can be given to the accused persons for non-exhibition thereof.[Paras 82, 83, 85, 87 and 89] Evidence Act, 1872 – s.32 – Treatment of FIR /Bayan Tahriri asdying declaration:Held: Statement by an injured person recorded as FIR can be treated asa dying declaration and such a statement is admissible u/s.32 of the EvidenceAct. On facts, the deceased gave his statement in the form of Bayan Tahririand narrated the entire incident and circumstances of the transaction whichresulted in his death. Subsequently, he died on account of injuries suff eredby him in the incident in question. FIR lodged on the basis of Bayan Tahrirof the injured is liable to be treated as a dying declaration, which itself is asubstantive piece of evidence and is admissible u/s.32(1) of the EvidenceAct. [Paras 91 and 95]Evidence – Ocular evidence – Testimony of deceased’s mother,an eyewitness, who was abducted by the accused side just before herexamination in the trial court.Held: The High Court ought to have considered the checkered historyof events that occurred in the case, resulting in the judgment of the DivisionBench of the High Court in the Habeas Corpus Petition containing seriousobservations about the conduct of all the stakeholders of the said criminaltrial. CW-1’s fi rst examination was scrapped by the High Court on theallegation of her kidnapping just a few days before that fi rst examinationdated 03.11.2006. She was under continuous threat and fear of facing direconsequence, which is apparent on the face of the record. Under thesecircumstances, in case she had stated in the end of her cross-examination thather son had asked her to take the name of the accused before the Trial Court,there is nothing so contradictory or surprising so as to treat the rest of thesubstantive ocular evidence as tutored one. There is no serious discrepancyor variation in the testimony of CW-1 with regard to the sequence of eventsthat occurred during the incident in question. When the entire family of CW-1was facing so many storms, it is quite natural for a son to say to her mother(who was old, illiterate, rustic woman having faced immense trauma) thatshe should not forget to disclose the name of accused persons, in as much asthe second occasion of her examination, as ordered by the Division Benchof High Court under Section 311 of CrPC, was the last opportunity for herto speak the truth before the Trial Court. There is nothing unusual in thestatement of CW-1. Her statement is found to be reliable, and the Courtsbelow wrongly discarded it on the ground that it was hearsay and tutored.[Paras 101, 102, 103, 104 and 114] Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 – s.311 – Power under – Scope:Held: s.311 CrPC confers wide powers on any court at any stage of anyinquiry, trial or other proceeding under this Code to summon material witnessor examine person present. Such person may not be a person summonedas a witness. Power to recall and re-examine is also vested. The concept isthat it should be essential for the just decision of the case. This power canbe exercised not only by the Trial Court but also by the appellate Court orrevisional Court. The logic behind this provision is that the endeavour of theCourts is to fi nd out the truth which would be essential for the just decisionof the case. [Para 112]Penal Code, 1860 – ss.302 and 307 – Double murder – Due toinjuries caused by fi re arm – Appeal against acquittal.Held: On facts, the post-mortem reports, show that the deaths werehomicidal in nature. The medico legal reports supported the prosecution’sstory to the extent that the injuries were caused by a fi re arm, which provedfatal for two out of the three injured. Fard Bayan registered on oral statementgiven by one of the injured (who died subsequently), which was laterconverted into an FIR, was admissible in evidence and is to be read as adying declaration or his last statement. The prosecution had established, eventhrough the hostile witnesses, that the date, time, and place of incidence asgiven in the Fard Bayan were fully established. Adverse inference againstthe accused is drawn in view of their subsequent conduct. Judicial notice istaken of judgment in the Habeas Corpus petition dated 13.07.2007 regardingthe conduct of the accused, the investigating agency, the Public Prosecutorand the Presiding Offi cer conducting the trial. Statement of CW-1 is foundto be reliable, and the Courts below wrongly discarded it on the groundthat it was hearsay and tutored. The dying declaration and the statement ofCW-1 fully establish that it was Respondent No.2 (accused no.1), who hadcaused the injuries from his fi rearm weapon, which proved to be fatal fortwo out of the three injured and also caused injury to the third survivinginjured. Respondent no.2 thus liable to be convicted under ss.302 and 307IPC. The rest of the accused, although named in the chargesheet after dueinvestigation, since their names were not refl ected either in the Fard Bayanof the deceased (dying declaration) or in the statement of CW1, therefore,their acquittal is not disturbed.

        "HeadNote": "Issues for consideration: In a double murder case, wherein it wasalleged that accused no.1-respondent no.2 had opened fi re from his rifl eresulting in injury to three persons, out of which two died, and the trial courthad acquitted accused-respondent nos. 2 to 8 of all the charges, which wasconfi rmed by the High Court in criminal revision, the issues before thisCourt were:(i) Whether the Supreme Court, in appeal against acquittal, couldconsider the High Court’s judgment dated 13.03.2007 passed in a HabeasCorpus Writ Petition (fi led pursuant to abduction of CW1, mother of oneof the deceased, ten days before the date fi xed for recording her statement),which was not part of the evidence produced (although it was part of theTrial Court record) and was not relied upon by the prosecution before theTrial Court, as a piece of incriminating evidence in the nature of a PublicDocument and, if yes, up to what extent.(ii) Whether the previous or subsequent conduct of the accused,established on record, can be treated as a circumstance against the accusedin view of Section 8 of the Evidence Act.(iii) Whether the FIR or Bayan Tahriri can be said to be proved as apiece of reliable prosecution evidence and if so, what would be the position oflaw on the issue of treating the FIR or Bayan Tahriri as the Dying Declaration.(iv) Whether the testimony of CW1 (an old feeble, rustic, illiteratelady and mother of the deceased and an eyewitness of the incident), who stated in the end of her cross-examination that “her son (another alive son)had asked her to take the name of accused before the Court,” can be treatedto be a reliable evidence against such accused, especially in view of thecheckered and abnormal history of the case.Evidence Act, 1872 – s.56 – Doctrine of judicial notice – JudicialNotice of fact in criminal matters – Maxim “res judicata pro veritateaccipitur”.Administration of Criminal Justice – Failure of three mainstakeholders in a criminal trial – Undesirable favour to accused – Pathdiff erent from the normal adopted to determine guilt of the accused.Held: Doctrine of judicial notice, as provided u/s.56 of the EvidenceAct, is an exception to general rules of evidence applicable for proving anyfact by adducing evidence in the Court of law. Except in the rarest of rarecases, judicial notice of any fact is generally not taken in criminal mattersin the normal course of proceeding. The present matter falls in the categoryof rarest of rare cases. Certain inferences, observations and fi ndings arrivedat by the Division Bench of High Court in judgment dated 13.03.2007in the Habeas Corpus Petition, have a crucial impact on the merit of thepresent case, as it gives a complete picture as to how the prosecutionversion in the present case was being demolished brick by brick by usingpolitical authority and muscle power with the aid of not only the policeadministration but also with the aid of Public Prosecutor and, the PresidingOffi cer of the Trial Court also conducted himself in a manner unbecomingof a Judicial Offi cer, despite directions and continuous vigil by the HighCourt. The judgment dated 13.03.2007, which is a public document, iswell discussed and is based upon authoritative materials and was passedin consonance with the doctrine of audi alteram partem. Moreover, it hasa torch bearer eff ect over the facts of the case. Accordingly, judicial noticetaken by the Supreme Court of the inferences, observations and fi ndingsarrived at by the Division Bench and the directions issued in its judgmentdated 13.03.2007 to the extent of the subsequent conduct of the accused,deplorable functioning of the Public Prosecutor, Police Administrationand the Presiding Offi cer of the Trial Court to extend undesirable favourto the accused. [Paras 66, 67 and 68] Evidence Act, 1872 – s.8 – Subsequent conduct of accused – Adverseinference – Maxim “qui sentit commodom, sentire debit et onus.”:Held: In the case in hand, a double murder case, the conduct ofaccused-respondent no.2 was not only relevant u/s.8 of the Evidence Actbut also one of the major circumstances to arrive at a conclusion about hisguilt. Respondent No.2 was instrumental in making all possible eff orts towipe out the evidence against him. The tainted investigation shows thehighhandedness of the Respondent no.2, who was a powerful person, beinga sitting M.P. of the Ruling Party. The question is why the accused wasinstrumental, when he was not guilty of the off ence to which he was beingtried. The obvious answer would be that his guilty mind was fearful aboutthe result. [Paras 70, 72, 73 and 114]Evidence Act, 1872 – s.74 – Bayan Tahriri / Written Statement ofdeceased – Evidentiary value:Held: FIR is a public document defi ned u/s.74 of the Evidence Act. Anypublic document does not stand proven by the mere fact of its production.At the stage of exhibiting any document as a piece of evidence, the truthof what is stated in the document is not considered. It is left open to fi nalevaluation at the trial after cross-examination, and the entire testimony ofthe witness about the existence and contents of the document is weighedin conjunction with various other factors emerging during a trial. Themarking of a piece of evidence as ‘exhibit’ at the stage of evidence in a trialproceeding is only for the purpose of identifi cation of evidence adducedin the trial and for the convenience of the Court and other stakeholders inorder to get a clear picture of what is being produced as evidence in a trialproceeding. In the present case, considering the failure of State machineryand failure of the Trial Court to ensure a fair trial from the perspective ofthe victim side, the aspect of non-marking of the FIR and Bayan Tahririas an exhibit, non-production of the formal witnesses, i.e., the ConstableClerk and Investigating Offi cer to prove the lodging of FIR/Bayan Tahririand fl imsy rejection of application fi led by a person seeking his examinationas a witness along with examination of two persons (who had signed saidwritten statement/Bayan Tahriri as attesting persons) as witnesses in the Trialproceeding do not vitiate the genuineness of the FIR and Bayan Tahriri, andno discount can be given to the accused persons for non-exhibition thereof.[Paras 82, 83, 85, 87 and 89] Evidence Act, 1872 – s.32 – Treatment of FIR /Bayan Tahriri asdying declaration:Held: Statement by an injured person recorded as FIR can be treated asa dying declaration and such a statement is admissible u/s.32 of the EvidenceAct. On facts, the deceased gave his statement in the form of Bayan Tahririand narrated the entire incident and circumstances of the transaction whichresulted in his death. Subsequently, he died on account of injuries suff eredby him in the incident in question. FIR lodged on the basis of Bayan Tahrirof the injured is liable to be treated as a dying declaration, which itself is asubstantive piece of evidence and is admissible u/s.32(1) of the EvidenceAct. [Paras 91 and 95]Evidence – Ocular evidence – Testimony of deceased’s mother,an eyewitness, who was abducted by the accused side just before herexamination in the trial court.Held: The High Court ought to have considered the checkered historyof events that occurred in the case, resulting in the judgment of the DivisionBench of the High Court in the Habeas Corpus Petition containing seriousobservations about the conduct of all the stakeholders of the said criminaltrial. CW-1’s fi rst examination was scrapped by the High Court on theallegation of her kidnapping just a few days before that fi rst examinationdated 03.11.2006. She was under continuous threat and fear of facing direconsequence, which is apparent on the face of the record. Under thesecircumstances, in case she had stated in the end of her cross-examination thather son had asked her to take the name of the accused before the Trial Court,there is nothing so contradictory or surprising so as to treat the rest of thesubstantive ocular evidence as tutored one. There is no serious discrepancyor variation in the testimony of CW-1 with regard to the sequence of eventsthat occurred during the incident in question. When the entire family of CW-1was facing so many storms, it is quite natural for a son to say to her mother(who was old, illiterate, rustic woman having faced immense trauma) thatshe should not forget to disclose the name of accused persons, in as much asthe second occasion of her examination, as ordered by the Division Benchof High Court under Section 311 of CrPC, was the last opportunity for herto speak the truth before the Trial Court. There is nothing unusual in thestatement of CW-1. Her statement is found to be reliable, and the Courtsbelow wrongly discarded it on the ground that it was hearsay and tutored.[Paras 101, 102, 103, 104 and 114] Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 – s.311 – Power under – Scope:Held: s.311 CrPC confers wide powers on any court at any stage of anyinquiry, trial or other proceeding under this Code to summon material witnessor examine person present. Such person may not be a person summonedas a witness. Power to recall and re-examine is also vested. The concept isthat it should be essential for the just decision of the case. This power canbe exercised not only by the Trial Court but also by the appellate Court orrevisional Court. The logic behind this provision is that the endeavour of theCourts is to fi nd out the truth which would be essential for the just decisionof the case. [Para 112]Penal Code, 1860 – ss.302 and 307 – Double murder – Due toinjuries caused by fi re arm – Appeal against acquittal.Held: On facts, the post-mortem reports, show that the deaths werehomicidal in nature. The medico legal reports supported the prosecution’sstory to the extent that the injuries were caused by a fi re arm, which provedfatal for two out of the three injured. Fard Bayan registered on oral statementgiven by one of the injured (who died subsequently), which was laterconverted into an FIR, was admissible in evidence and is to be read as adying declaration or his last statement. The prosecution had established, eventhrough the hostile witnesses, that the date, time, and place of incidence asgiven in the Fard Bayan were fully established. Adverse inference againstthe accused is drawn in view of their subsequent conduct. Judicial notice istaken of judgment in the Habeas Corpus petition dated 13.07.2007 regardingthe conduct of the accused, the investigating agency, the Public Prosecutorand the Presiding Offi cer conducting the trial. Statement of CW-1 is foundto be reliable, and the Courts below wrongly discarded it on the groundthat it was hearsay and tutored. The dying declaration and the statement ofCW-1 fully establish that it was Respondent No.2 (accused no.1), who hadcaused the injuries from his fi rearm weapon, which proved to be fatal fortwo out of the three injured and also caused injury to the third survivinginjured. Respondent no.2 thus liable to be convicted under ss.302 and 307IPC. The rest of the accused, although named in the chargesheet after dueinvestigation, since their names were not refl ected either in the Fard Bayanof the deceased (dying declaration) or in the statement of CW1, therefore,their acquittal is not disturbed.

Except in the rarest of rarecases, judicial notice of any fact is generally not taken in criminal mattersin the normal course of proceeding. The present matter falls in the categoryof rarest of rare cases. Certain inferences, observations and fi ndings arrivedat by the Division Bench of High Court in judgment dated 13.03.2007in the Habeas Corpus Petition, have a crucial impact on the merit of thepresent case, as it gives a complete picture as to how the prosecutionversion in the present case was being demolished brick by brick by usingpolitical authority and muscle power with the aid of not only the policeadministration but also with the aid of Public Prosecutor and, the PresidingOffi cer of the Trial Court also conducted himself in a manner unbecomingof a Judicial Offi cer, despite directions and continuous vigil by the HighCourt. The judgment dated 13.03.2007, which is a public document, iswell discussed and is based upon authoritative materials and was passedin consonance with the doctrine of audi alteram partem. Moreover, it hasa torch bearer eff ect over the facts of the case. Accordingly, judicial noticetaken by the Supreme Court of the inferences, observations and fi ndingsarrived at by the Division Bench and the directions issued in its judgmentdated 13.03.2007 to the extent of the subsequent conduct of the accused,deplorable functioning of the Public Prosecutor, Police Administrationand the Presiding Offi cer of the Trial Court to extend undesirable favourto the accused. [Paras 66, 67 and 68] Evidence Act, 1872 – s.8 – Subsequent conduct of accused – Adverseinference – Maxim “qui sentit commodom, sentire debit et onus.”:Held: In the case in hand, a double murder case, the conduct ofaccused-respondent no.2 was not only relevant u/s.8 of the Evidence Actbut also one of the major circumstances to arrive at a conclusion about hisguilt. Respondent No.2 was instrumental in making all possible eff orts towipe out the evidence against him. The tainted investigation shows thehighhandedness of the Respondent no.2, who was a powerful person, beinga sitting M.P. of the Ruling Party. The question is why the accused wasinstrumental, when he was not guilty of the off ence to which he was beingtried. The obvious answer would be that his guilty mind was fearful aboutthe result. [Paras 70, 72, 73 and 114]Evidence Act, 1872 – s.74 – Bayan Tahriri / Written Statement ofdeceased – Evidentiary value:Held: FIR is a public document defi ned u/s.74 of the Evidence Act. Anypublic document does not stand proven by the mere fact of its production.At the stage of exhibiting any document as a piece of evidence, the truthof what is stated in the document is not considered. It is left open to fi nalevaluation at the trial after cross-examination, and the entire testimony ofthe witness about the existence and contents of the document is weighedin conjunction with various other factors emerging during a trial. Themarking of a piece of evidence as ‘exhibit’ at the stage of evidence in a trialproceeding is only for the purpose of identifi cation of evidence adducedin the trial and for the convenience of the Court and other stakeholders inorder to get a clear picture of what is being produced as evidence in a trialproceeding. In the present case, considering the failure of State machineryand failure of the Trial Court to ensure a fair trial from the perspective ofthe victim side, the aspect of non-marking of the FIR and Bayan Tahririas an exhibit, non-production of the formal witnesses, i.e., the ConstableClerk and Investigating Offi cer to prove the lodging of FIR/Bayan Tahririand fl imsy rejection of application fi led by a person seeking his examinationas a witness along with examination of two persons (who had signed saidwritten statement/Bayan Tahriri as attesting persons) as witnesses in the Trialproceeding do not vitiate the genuineness of the FIR and Bayan Tahriri, andno discount can be given to the accused persons for non-exhibition thereof.[Paras 82, 83, 85, 87 and 89] Evidence Act, 1872 – s.32 – Treatment of FIR /Bayan Tahriri asdying declaration:Held: Statement by an injured person recorded as FIR can be treated asa dying declaration and such a statement is admissible u/s.32 of the EvidenceAct. On facts, the deceased gave his statement in the form of Bayan Tahririand narrated the entire incident and circumstances of the transaction whichresulted in his death. Subsequently, he died on account of injuries suff eredby him in the incident in question. FIR lodged on the basis of Bayan Tahrirof the injured is liable to be treated as a dying declaration, which itself is asubstantive piece of evidence and is admissible u/s.32(1) of the EvidenceAct. [Paras 91 and 95]Evidence – Ocular evidence – Testimony of deceased’s mother,an eyewitness, who was abducted by the accused side just before herexamination in the trial court.Held: The High Court ought to have considered the checkered historyof events that occurred in the case, resulting in the judgment of the DivisionBench of the High Court in the Habeas Corpus Petition containing seriousobservations about the conduct of all the stakeholders of the said criminaltrial. CW-1’s fi rst examination was scrapped by the High Court on theallegation of her kidnapping just a few days before that fi rst examinationdated 03.11.2006. She was under continuous threat and fear of facing direconsequence, which is apparent on the face of the record. Under thesecircumstances, in case she had stated in the end of her cross-examination thather son had asked her to take the name of the accused before the Trial Court,there is nothing so contradictory or surprising so as to treat the rest of thesubstantive ocular evidence as tutored one. There is no serious discrepancyor variation in the testimony of CW-1 with regard to the sequence of eventsthat occurred during the incident in question. When the entire family of CW-1was facing so many storms, it is quite natural for a son to say to her mother(who was old, illiterate, rustic woman having faced immense trauma) thatshe should not forget to disclose the name of accused persons, in as much asthe second occasion of her examination, as ordered by the Division Benchof High Court under Section 311 of CrPC, was the last opportunity for herto speak the truth before the Trial Court. There is nothing unusual in thestatement of CW-1. Her statement is found to be reliable, and the Courtsbelow wrongly discarded it on the ground that it was hearsay and tutored.[Paras 101, 102, 103, 104 and 114] Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 – s.311 – Power under – Scope:Held: s.311 CrPC confers wide powers on any court at any stage of anyinquiry, trial or other proceeding under this Code to summon material witnessor examine person present. Such person may not be a person summonedas a witness. Power to recall and re-examine is also vested. The concept isthat it should be essential for the just decision of the case. This power canbe exercised not only by the Trial Court but also by the appellate Court orrevisional Court. The logic behind this provision is that the endeavour of theCourts is to fi nd out the truth which would be essential for the just decisionof the case. [Para 112]Penal Code, 1860 – ss.302 and 307 – Double murder – Due toinjuries caused by fi re arm – Appeal against acquittal.Held: On facts, the post-mortem reports, show that the deaths werehomicidal in nature. The medico legal reports supported the prosecution’sstory to the extent that the injuries were caused by a fi re arm, which provedfatal for two out of the three injured. Fard Bayan registered on oral statementgiven by one of the injured (who died subsequently), which was laterconverted into an FIR, was admissible in evidence and is to be read as adying declaration or his last statement. The prosecution had established, eventhrough the hostile witnesses, that the date, time, and place of incidence asgiven in the Fard Bayan were fully established. Adverse inference againstthe accused is drawn in view of their subsequent conduct. Judicial notice istaken of judgment in the Habeas Corpus petition dated 13.07.2007 regardingthe conduct of the accused, the investigating agency, the Public Prosecutorand the Presiding Offi cer conducting the trial. Statement of CW-1 is foundto be reliable, and the Courts below wrongly discarded it on the groundthat it was hearsay and tutored. The dying declaration and the statement ofCW-1 fully establish that it was Respondent No.2 (accused no.1), who hadcaused the injuries from his fi rearm weapon, which proved to be fatal fortwo out of the three injured and also caused injury to the third survivinginjured. Respondent no.2 thus liable to be convicted under ss.302 and 307IPC. The rest of the accused, although named in the chargesheet after dueinvestigation, since their names were not refl ected either in the Fard Bayanof the deceased (dying declaration) or in the statement of CW1, therefore,their acquittal is not disturbed.
