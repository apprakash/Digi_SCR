        "HeadNote": "Environment Protection Act, 1986 – 2011 Notification issuedunder the 1986 Act – Respondent No.1 granted ex post factoclearance to the appellant purportedly invoking paragraph-4.3 ofthe aforesaid Notification, for laying of pipeline for the transfer ofedible oil from the Chennai Port to the storage terminal tank andfor the establishment of the storage transit terminal – NGT heldthat the activity of putting up a storage tank transit terminal beingcontrary to the 2011 Notification was illegal as the storage terminalwas not located ‘in’ the Chennai Port, in which case alone, it wouldhave been permissible under the permitted activities of CoastalRegulation Zone II – Construction of the storage facility and thepipeline were directed to be removed, environmental compensationimposed – Appellant inter alia contended that CRZ-II being lesssensitive than CRZ-I, in CRZ-I, the “storage of edible oil inter aliais permitted within the notified ports” while, in CRZ-II, storage ofnon-hazardous cargo such as edible oil, fertilizers and foodgrainis permitted ‘in notified ports’ – And since the word ‘within’ which isused in CRZ-I is not employed in regard to the similar activity inCRZ-II and instead the word ‘in’ is used, they must receive a differentmeaning – Held: Objects of the notification include guarding againstthe dangers of natural hazards in coastal areas and the sea levelrise due to global warming – The coastal regulation appears to bebased on considerations which appear to accommodate conflictinginterests premised on considerations of what is felt as indispensablynecessary and the nature of the zone in question – Words ‘within’and ‘in’ cannot include what is outside the port – The maker of thenotification has not even contemplated the activities in question ina ‘port area’ – A storage tank cannot be permitted outside the portlimits – If the same is allowed, it will introduce chaos – Questionwould arise as to up to what distance from the port area it would be considered as the ‘in the port area’ – The 2011 Notification cannotreceive an interpretation which would leave matters of moment tobe afflicted with the vice of uncertainty – As far as the pipeline isconcerned, it is located in a zone where it is permitted activity – Asto whether the pipeline can continue to be used if the storage tanksare demolished is a matter which must engage the attention of theauthorities – Appellants may approach the relevant District CoastalZonal Management Authority – Appellants given six months periodto demolish the storage tanks to comply with the impugned order ofthe NGT – Appellant in the first appeal to pay the compensationordered within a month – Major Port Trust Act, 1964 – s. 35 –Customs Act – ss.2(11), (12), (13), 7(a), 57 – Indian Ports Act, 1908– National Green Tribunal Act, 2010.Customs Act – ss.7(a), 57 – Indian Ports Act, 1908 – MajorPort Trust Act, 1964 – s. 35 – Held: Every port falling under theIndian Port Act and the Major Port Act may not be on their ownbecome a customs port – A customs port u/s.2(12) comes into beingon a port being appointed as such u/s.7(a) – The case of the appellantbased on the license u/s.57 of the Customs Act may make it a customsarea as it includes a warehouse but, it is inconceivable as to how itwould transform it into ‘in a notified port’ – Environment ProtectionAct, 1986.",

        "HeadNote": " Assam Rural Health Regulatory Authority Act, 2004 – Constitutionality of – Legislative Competency of the State – Assam State legislature enacted the Assam Rural Health Regulatory Authority Act, 2004 – Said Act provides for the establishment of a regulatory authority to register the Diploma holders and to regulate their practice – State Act in conflict with Central Act (Indian Medical Council Act, 1956) – Writ Petition challenging the Constitutionality of the Act – High Court allowed the Writ petition by holding that the Act, 2004 was unconstitutional as the State Act was in conflict with the Central Act – High Court observed that the power and scope of the State to legislate under Entry 25 of List III of the Seventh Schedule is very limited and is only in respect of a field unoccupied by a Central Act – Held: Prescription of minimum standards for medical education, authority to recognise or de-recognise an institution etc., are areas over which exclusive legislative competence lies with the Parliament, under Entry 66 of List I – The State Legislatures, on the other hand, under Entry 25 of List III, possess legislative competence to legislate with respect to all other aspects of education, except determination of minimum standards and co-ordination – In view of the Indian Medical Council Act, 1956 and the Rules and Regulations made thereunder, the Assam Rural Health Regulatory Authority Act, 2004, declared to be null and void as State Legislature not having the legislative competence to enact the said Law – The State Legislature has no legislative competence to enact a law which is in conflict with the law setting the standards of medical education in the context of modern medicine or allopathic medicine, which has been determined by Parliamentary Legislation as well as the Rules – Constitution of India – Seventh Schedule – List I, Entry 66 and List III, Entry 25.\n\nAssam Community Professionals (Registration and Competency) Act, 2015 – Constitutionality of – Power of Legislature – To overrule a Judicial Decision – High Court vide the impugned order allowed Writ petition holding that the Assam Rural Health Regulatory Authority Act, 2004 enacted by the State legislature was unconstitutional as the Act was in conflict with the Central Act (Indian Medical Council Act, 1956) and State Legislature not having the legislative competence to enact the said Law – Meanwhile, the State passed the Assam Community Professionals (Registration and Competency) Act, 2015 – Held: The Legislature cannot directly overrule a judicial decision – But when a competent Legislature retrospectively removes the substratum or foundation of a judgment to make the decision ineffective, the said exercise is a valid legislative exercise provided it does not transgress on any other constitutional limitation – The power of the sovereign legislature to legislate within its field, both prospectively and retrospectively cannot be questioned – It would be permissible for the legislature to remove a defect in earlier legislation pointed out by a constitutional court in exercise of its powers by way of judicial review – The Assam Community Professionals (Registration and Competency) Act, 2015, enacted pursuant to the judgment of the High Court, is a valid piece of Legislation as it removed the basis of the impugned judgment passed by the High Court – The 2015 Act is also not in conflict with the IMC, Act, 1956 – This is because the Central Act namely, IMC, Act, 1956 does not deal with Community Health Professionals who would practise as allopathic practitioners in the manner as they were permitted to practise under the Assam Rural Health Regulatory Authority Act, 2004, in rural areas of the State of Assam – Hence, by a separate legislation the Community Health Professionals have been permitted to practise as such professionals – The said legislation of 2015 is not in conflict with IMC, Act, 1956 and the rules and regulations made thereunder – Hence, the Act of 2015 is not hit by Entry 66 of List I of the Constitution and is within the legislative competence of the State Legislature under the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution.\n\nConstitution of India: Seventh Schedule – Art. 245, 246 & 254 – Interplay between Entry 66 of List I and Entry 25 of List III – Held: The question of invasion into another legislative territory has to be determined by substance and not by degree – Where one Entry is made ‘subject to’ another Entry, all that it means is that out of the scope of the former Entry, a field of legislation covered by the latter Entry has been reserved to be specially dealt with by the appropriate Legislature – The field of legislation covered under Entry 25 of List III is subject to Entries 63, 64, 65 and 66 of List I – Dual restrictions operate in the legislative competence of a State Legislature to enact any law under Entry 25 of List III – First is, if such a law is to be made by the State Legislature, it is always subject to Entries 63, 64, 65 and 66 of List I or the Union List, in respect of which only the Parliament has the power to enact a law – The second restriction is with regard to the subject of the Entry as a whole – When any law is made under Entry 25 of List III by a State Legislature, the same is always subject to Entry 66 of List I – Modern scientific medicine or allopathic medicine is within the scope of Entry 66 of List I and not under Entry 25 of List III – In the instant case the law made by the State Legislature is hit by the first

legislative competence to enact the said Law – Meanwhile, the State passed the Assam Community Professionals (Registration and Competency) Act, 2015 – Held: The Legislature cannot directly overrule a judicial decision – But when a competent Legislature retrospectively removes the substratum or foundation of a judgment to make the decision ineffective, the said exercise is a valid legislative exercise provided it does not transgress on any other constitutional limitation – The power of the sovereign legislature to legislate within its field, both prospectively and retrospectively cannot be questioned – It would be permissible for the legislature to remove a defect in earlier legislation pointed out by a constitutional court in exercise of its powers by way of judicial review – The Assam Community Professionals (Registration and Competency) Act, 2015, enacted pursuant to the judgment of the High Court, is a valid piece of Legislation as it removed the basis of the impugned judgment passed by the High Court – The 2015 Act is also not in conflict with the IMC, Act, 1956 – This is because the Central Act namely, IMC, Act, 1956 does not deal with Community Health Professionals who

Transfer of Property Act, 1882 – s.100 – Charge – Whetherarrears of electricity can become a charge or encumbrance overthe premise – Effect of statutory regulations or rules enacted by aregulatory commission – Held: A charge cannot be enforced againsta transferee if they have no notice of the same, unless the requirementof such notice has been dispensed with by law – The provisions ofthe 1910 Act, 1948 Act, and the 2003 Act do not provide that thearrears of electricity dues would constitute a charge on the propertyor that such a charge shall be enforceable against a transfereewithout notice – In Isha Marbles, the Supreme Court observed thatunder the provisions of 1910 Act r/w. 1948 Act, electricity arrearsdo not create a charge over the property – Consequently, in generallaw, a transferee of the premises cannot be made liable for theoutstanding dues of the previous owner since electricity arrears donot automatically become a charge over the premises – The rulemaking power contained u/s. 181 r/w. s. 50 of Electricity Act, 2003is wide enough to enable the regulatory commission to provide fora statutory charge in the absence of a provision in the plenary statuteproviding for creation of such a charge – The electricity utilitiescan create a charge by framing subordinate legislation or statutoryconditions of supply enabling recovery of electricity arrears from asubsequent transferee – Such a condition is rooted in the importanceof protecting electricity which is a public good – Public utilitiesinvest huge amounts of capital and infrastructure in providingelectricity supply – The failure or inability to recover outstandingelectricity dues of the premises would negatively impact thefunctioning of such public utilities and licensees – Electricity Act,2003 – ss. 50 and 181– Maharashtra Electrici ty RegulatoryCommission (Electricity Supply Code and other Conditions ofSupply) Regulations, 2005 – Regulation 10.5.Electricity Act, 2003 – s. 43 – Whether the duty to supplyelectricity is absolute – Held: s.43 begins with the words “Save asotherwise provided in this Act” – Hence, the operation of s.43 willalso be subject to compliance with the other provisions of the 2003Act – Under s.43, the distribution licensee is obligated to supplyelectricity to the premises of an owner or occupier, provided thatthe owner or occupier pays all charges and complies with allconditions stipulated by the distribution licensee – The proviso tos.43(2) further refers to the “price” payable by an applicant to demand or to continue to receive the supply of electricity from adistribution licensee – The term “price” has to be given a broadmeaning to include all the ‘tariffs’ and ‘charges’ that may bedetermined by the appropriate commission – Thus, the duty to supplyelectricity u/s.43 is not absolute, and is subject to the such chargesand compliances stipulated by the distribution licensees as part ofthe application.Electricity Act, 2003 – ss.2(15) and 43 – Whether duty tosupply electricity is with respect to the premises or to the consumer– Held: The definition of ‘supply’ specifically states that supplymeans the sale of electricity to a consumer – Considering the overallscheme of the 2003 Act, the supply of electricity is to the consumerand not the premises – It is the owner or occupier who has thestatutory right to “demand” electricity for the premises under theiruse or occupation – Thus, it is always the consumer who is suppliedelectricity and is held liable for defaulting on payment of dues orcharges for supply of electricityAuction – Auction sale of premises on “as in where is” basis– With or without reference to electricity arrears-Implication – Held:When a property is sold on an “as is where is” basis, encumbranceson the property stand transferred to the purchaser upon the sale –All prospective auction purchasers are put on notice of the liabilityto pay the pending dues when an appropriate “as is where is” clauseis incorporated in the auction sale agreement – While examiningthe effect of an “as is where is” clause, the facts and circumstancesof each case individually, along with the terminology of the clausesgoverning the auction sales must be taken into consideration, toarrive at an equitable decision.Interpretation of Statutes – Principle of Ejusdem Generis –Rule of Construction – Applicability of – Ingredients – Discussed.",

M. Joseph, J. (for himself and forAniruddha Bose, J.)] : An instrument, which is exigible to stampduty, may contain an Arbitration Clause and which is not stamped,cannot be said to be a contract, which is enforceable in law withinthe meaning of s.2(h) of the Contract Act and is not enforceableunder s.2(g) of the Contract Act – An unstamped instrument, whenit is required to be stamped, being not a contract and not enforceablein law, cannot, therefore, exist in law – The true intention behindthe insertion of s.11(6A) in the Act was to confine the Court, actingunder s.11, to examine and ascertain about the existence of anArbitration Agreement – The Scheme permits the Court, under s.11of the Act, acting on the basis of the original agreement or on acertified copy –The certified copy must, however, clearly indicatethe stamp duty paid – If it does not do so, the Court should not acton such a certified copy – If the original of the instrument isproduced and it is unstamped, the Court, acting under s.11, is dutyboundto act under s.33 of the Stamp Act – When it does so, theother provisions, which, in the case of the payment of the duty andpenalty would culminate in the certificate under s.42(2) of the Stamp Act, would also apply – When such a stage arises, the Court will befree to process the Application as per law – An Arbi trationAgreement, within the meaning of s.7 of the Act, which attracts stampduty and which is not stamped or insufficiently stamped, cannot beacted upon, in view of s.35 of the Stamp Act, unless followingimpounding and payment of the requisite duty, necessary certificateis provided under s.42 of the Stamp Act – The provisions of s.33and the bar under s.35 of the Stamp Act, applicable to instrumentschargeable to stamp duty under s.3 read with the Schedule to theStamp Act, would render the Arbitration Agreement contained insuch instrument as being non-existent in law unless the instrumentis validated under the Stamp Act – Held (per C. T. Ravikumar, J.)(concurring): Being unstamped or insufficiently stamped, theagreement would not be available to be ‘admitted in evidence’ and‘to be acted upon’, till it is validated following the proceduresprescribed under the provisions of the Stamp Act and till then, itwould not exist ‘in law’ – When the original document carrying thearbitration clause is produced and if it is found that it is unstampedor insufficiently stamped, the Court acting under s.11 is duty boundto act u/s.33 of the Indian Stamp Act – Held (per Ajay Rastogi, J.)(dissenting): The existence of a copy/certified copy of an arbitrationagreement whether unstamped/insufficiently stamped at the prereferralstage is an enforceable document for purposes ofappointment of an Arbitrator under s.11(6A) of the Act, 1996 wherethe judicial intervention shall be minimal confined only to the primafacie examination of “existence of an arbitration agreement” alonekeeping in view the object of 2015 amendment and the courts muststrictly adhere to the time schedule for appointment of Arbitratorprescribed under s.11(13) of the Act, 1996 – All the preliminary /debatable issues including insufficiently stamped/unduly stampedor validity of the arbitration agreement etc. are referrable to theArbitrator/Arbitral Tribunal under s.16 of the Act, 1996 which, byvirtue of the Doctrine of Kompetenz - Kompetenz has the power todo so – Held (per Hrishikesh Roy, J.) (dissenting): The examinationof stamping and impounding need not be done at the threshold by aCourt, at the pre-reference stage under s.11 of the Arbitration Act,1996 – Non-stamping /insufficient stamping of the substantivecontract/instrument would not render the arbitration agreement nonexistentin law and unenforceable /void, for the purpose of referring a matter for arbitration – An arbitration agreement should not berendered void if it is suffering stamp deficiency which is a curabledefect..",

M. Joseph, J. (for himself and forAniruddha Bose, J.)] : An instrument, which is exigible to stampduty, may contain an Arbitration Clause and which is not stamped,cannot be said to be a contract, which is enforceable in law withinthe meaning of s.2(h) of the Contract Act and is not enforceableunder s.2(g) of the Contract Act – An unstamped instrument, whenit is required to be stamped, being not a contract and not enforceablein law, cannot, therefore, exist in law – The true intention behindthe insertion of s.11(6A) in the Act was to confine the Court, actingunder s.11, to examine and ascertain about the existence of anArbitration Agreement – The Scheme permits the Court, under s.11of the Act, acting on the basis of the original agreement or on acertified copy –The certified copy must, however, clearly indicatethe stamp duty paid – If it does not do so, the Court should not acton such a certified copy – If the original of the instrument isproduced and it is unstamped, the Court, acting under s.11, is dutyboundto act under s.33 of the Stamp Act – When it does so, theother provisions, which, in the case of the payment of the duty andpenalty would culminate in the certificate under s.42(2) of the Stamp Act, would also apply – When such a stage arises, the Court will befree to process the Application as per law – An Arbi trationAgreement, within the meaning of s.7 of the Act, which attracts stampduty and which is not stamped or insufficiently stamped, cannot beacted upon, in view of s.35 of the Stamp Act, unless followingimpounding and payment of the requisite duty, necessary certificateis provided under s.42 of the Stamp Act – The provisions of s.33and the bar under s.35 of the Stamp Act, applicable to instrumentschargeable to stamp duty under s.3 read with the Schedule to theStamp Act, would render the Arbitration Agreement contained insuch instrument as being non-existent in law unless the instrumentis validated under the Stamp Act – Held (per C. T. Ravikumar, J.)(concurring): Being unstamped or insufficiently stamped, theagreement would not be available to be ‘admitted in evidence’ and‘to be acted upon’, till it is validated following the proceduresprescribed under the provisions of the Stamp Act and till then, itwould not exist ‘in law’ – When the original document carrying thearbitration clause is produced and if it is found that it is unstampedor insufficiently stamped, the Court acting under s.11 is duty boundto act u/s.33 of the Indian Stamp Act – Held (per Ajay Rastogi, J.)(dissenting): The existence of a copy/certified copy of an arbitrationagreement whether unstamped/insufficiently stamped at the prereferralstage is an enforceable document for purposes ofappointment of an Arbitrator under s.11(6A) of the Act, 1996 wherethe judicial intervention shall be minimal confined only to the primafacie examination of “existence of an arbitration agreement” alonekeeping in view the object of 2015 amendment and the courts muststrictly adhere to the time schedule for appointment of Arbitratorprescribed under s.11(13) of the Act, 1996 – All the preliminary /debatable issues including insufficiently stamped/unduly stampedor validity of the arbitration agreement etc. are referrable to theArbitrator/Arbitral Tribunal under s.16 of the Act, 1996 which, byvirtue of the Doctrine of Kompetenz - Kompetenz has the power todo so – Held (per Hrishikesh Roy, J.) (dissenting): The examinationof stamping and impounding need not be done at the threshold by aCourt, at the pre-reference stage under s.11 of the Arbitration Act,1996 – Non-stamping /insufficient stamping of the substantivecontract/instrument would not render the arbitration agreement nonexistentin law and unenforceable /void, for the purpose of referring a matter for arbitration – An arbitration agreement should not berendered void if it is suffering stamp deficiency which is a curabledefect..",

M. Joseph, J.) (for himself, Aniruddha Bose, Hrishikesh Roy and C. T. Ravikumar, JJ.): Second proviso to Article 324(5) onlyenacts the protection that the Election Commissioner or RegionalCommissioner shall not be removed from Office except on therecommendation of the Chief Election Commissioner – There isequality otherwise, which exists between the Chief ElectionCommissioner and the Election Commissioners in various matters –The argument that the Election Commissioner must be accorded thesame protection as is given to the Chief Election Commissioner,appears to be untenable, on a plain reading of Article 324(5) – Inthe context of the said provision, the words ‘provided further’ cannotbe perceived as an additional protect ion to the ElectionCommissioner – It is for Parliament acting in the constituent capacityto consider whether it would be advisable to extend the protectionto the Election Commissioners so as to safeguard and ensure theindependence of the Election Commissioners as well – Held (perAjay Rastogi, J.) Various reports have recommended that theprotection against removal available to the Chief ElectionCommissioner should be made available to the other ElectionCommissioners to ensure the independence of the ElectionCommission – Keeping in view the importance of maintaining theneutrality and independence of the office of the Election Commissionto hold free and fair election which is a sine qua non for upholdingthe democracy as enshrined in our Constitut ion, it becomesimperative to shield the appointment of Election Commissioners andto be insulated from the executive interference – It is the need of thehour and advisable, to extend the protection available to the ChiefElection Commissioner under the first proviso to Article 324(5) toother Election Commissioners as well until any law is being framedby the Parliament – The conditions of service of the ElectionCommissioners shall not be varied to his disadvantage afterappointment – Election Commission (Conditions of Service ofElection Commissioners and Transaction of Business) Act, 1991.Election Laws: Independent Permanent Secretariat forElection Commission – Expenditure on the Consolidated Fund ofIndia – Held (per K. M. Joseph, J.) (for himself, Aniruddha Bose,Hrishikesh Roy and C. T. Ravikumar): It is a matter of policy – TheElection Commission of India is to perform the arduous andunenviable task of remaining aloof from all forms of subjugationby and interference from the Executive – The Executive can bringan otherwise independent Body to its knees, by starving it off or cutting off the requisite financial wherewithal and resources requiredfor its efficient and independent functioning – One cannot beoblivious to the need for articulation of details in regard to theexpenditure, which is a matter of policy - Urgent need to providefor a permanent Secretariat and also to provide that the expenditurebe charged on the Consolidated Fund of India – It is for the Unionof India to seriously consider bringing in the much-needed change– Union of India /Parliament may consider bringing in the necessarychanges so that the Election Commission of India becomes trulyindependent.Constitution of India – Art. 326 – Representation of the PeopleAct, 1951 – s.62 – Right to Vote – Nature of Right – Whether StatutoryRight or Constitutional Right – Held (per K. M. Joseph, J.) (for himself,Aniruddha Bose, Hrishikesh Roy and C.T. Ravikumar, JJ.): The rightto vote is not a civil right – The Right to Vote inevitably follows fromthe inclusion of a person in the electoral roll – According to Art.326, where the citizen is not less than eighteen years and does nothave the disqualifications, he becomes entitled to be entered in theelectoral roll – Such person, as is indicated in Article 326, indeed,has a right, which can be said to be a Constitutional Right, whichmay be right subject to the restriction – Held (Ajay Rastogi, J.) – Byvirtue of Article 326, the right to vote became a constitutional rightgranted to citizens – The said right was given effect by s.62 ofRepresentation of the People (ROP) Act, 1951 – The right to vote isnot just a statutory right – The right to vote is an expression of thechoice of the citizen, which is a fundamental right under Art.19(1)(a)– The right to vote is not limited only to Art.326, but flows throughArts.15, 17, 19, 21 – The right to vote in direct elections is afundamental right, subject to limitations laid down in Art. 326 –The right to vote is not merely a constitutional right, but a componentof Part III of the Constitution.Election Laws: Constitution of India – Art.14 – Rule of Law –Role of Election Commission – Held (per K. M. Joseph, J.) (for himself,Aniruddha Bose, Hrishikesh Roy and C. T. Ravikumar, JJ.): Rule oflaw is the very bedrock of a democratic form of governance – AnElection Commission which does not ensure free and fair poll asper the rules of the game, guarantees the breakdown of thefoundation of the rule of law – Any action or omission by the Election Commission in holding the poll which treats political partieswith an uneven hand and in an unfair or arbitrary manner wouldbe anathema to the mandate of Article 14, and therefore, cause itsbreach.Constitution of India – Art. 142 – Power of the Court to laydown guidelines in order to fill legislative gaps – Held (per AjayRastogi, J.): The Supreme Court has plenary power under Article142 to issue directions to do “complete justice” – The Court hascreated a jurisprudence, where it has exercised its power underArticle 142 to fill legislative gaps – Supreme Court has laid downguidelines in order to fill the legislative gap on a number ofoccasions – Series of case laws authoritatively demonstrate thecommitment of Supreme Court to intervene to preserve and promotethe “Rule of Law”, by supplementing the legislative gaps till theLegislature steps in.",

        "HeadNote": "Election Laws: Constitution of India – Arts. 324(2), 32 and142 –Appointment of Chief Election Commissioner and ElectionCommissioners – Method of – Independence of Election Commission– Constitutional validity of the practice of Union of India to appointthe members of the Election Commission – Held: The vacuum in thecase of Art.324(2) is the absence of the law which Parliament wascontemplated to enact – This Court is concerned with the devastatingeffect of continuing to leave appointments in the sole hands of theExecutive on fundamental values and also fundamental rights –Time is ripe for the Court to lay down norms – Imperative need forthe Court to step in – Vacuum exists on the basis that unlike otherappointments, it was intended all throughout that appointmentexclusively by the Executive was to be a mere transient or stop gaparrangement and it was to be replaced by a law made by theParliament taking away the exclusive power of the Executive – Thisconclusion is clear and inevitable and the absence of law evenafter seven decades points to the vacuum –As far as appointment tothe posts of Chief Election Commissioner and the ElectionCommissioners are concerned, the same shall be done by thePresident of India on the basis of the advice tendered by a Committeeconsisting of the Prime Minister of India, the Leader of theOpposition in the Lok Sabha and, in case, there is no such Leader,the Leader of the largest Party in the Opposition in the Lok Sabhahaving the largest numerical strength, and the Chief Justice of India– This norm will continue to hold good till a law is made by theParliament.Election Laws: Constitution of India – Art.324(5) – Protectionof Election Commissioner – Whether the Election Commissioner isentitled to same protection as given to Chief Election Commissioner– Held (per K. M. Joseph, J.) (for himself, Aniruddha Bose, Hrishikesh Roy and C. T. Ravikumar, JJ.): Second proviso to Article 324(5) onlyenacts the protection that the Election Commissioner or RegionalCommissioner shall not be removed from Office except on therecommendation of the Chief Election Commissioner – There isequality otherwise, which exists between the Chief ElectionCommissioner and the Election Commissioners in various matters –The argument that the Election Commissioner must be accorded thesame protection as is given to the Chief Election Commissioner,appears to be untenable, on a plain reading of Article 324(5) – Inthe context of the said provision, the words ‘provided further’ cannotbe perceived as an additional protect ion to the ElectionCommissioner – It is for Parliament acting in the constituent capacityto consider whether it would be advisable to extend the protectionto the Election Commissioners so as to safeguard and ensure theindependence of the Election Commissioners as well – Held (perAjay Rastogi, J.) Various reports have recommended that theprotection against removal available to the Chief ElectionCommissioner should be made available to the other ElectionCommissioners to ensure the independence of the ElectionCommission – Keeping in view the importance of maintaining theneutrality and independence of the office of the Election Commissionto hold free and fair election which is a sine qua non for upholdingthe democracy as enshrined in our Constitut ion, it becomesimperative to shield the appointment of Election Commissioners andto be insulated from the executive interference – It is the need of thehour and advisable, to extend the protection available to the ChiefElection Commissioner under the first proviso to Article 324(5) toother Election Commissioners as well until any law is being framedby the Parliament – The conditions of service of the ElectionCommissioners shall not be varied to his disadvantage afterappointment – Election Commission (Conditions of Service ofElection Commissioners and Transaction of Business) Act, 1991.Election Laws: Independent Permanent Secretariat forElection Commission – Expenditure on the Consolidated Fund ofIndia – Held (per K. M. Joseph, J.) (for himself, Aniruddha Bose,Hrishikesh Roy and C. T. Ravikumar): It is a matter of policy – TheElection Commission of India is to perform the arduous andunenviable task of remaining aloof from all forms of subjugationby and interference from the Executive – The Executive can bringan otherwise independent Body to its knees, by starving it off or cutting off the requisite financial wherewithal and resources requiredfor its efficient and independent functioning – One cannot beoblivious to the need for articulation of details in regard to theexpenditure, which is a matter of policy - Urgent need to providefor a permanent Secretariat and also to provide that the expenditurebe charged on the Consolidated Fund of India – It is for the Unionof India to seriously consider bringing in the much-needed change– Union of India /Parliament may consider bringing in the necessarychanges so that the Election Commission of India becomes trulyindependent.Constitution of India – Art. 326 – Representation of the PeopleAct, 1951 – s.62 – Right to Vote – Nature of Right – Whether StatutoryRight or Constitutional Right – Held (per K. M. Joseph, J.) (for himself,Aniruddha Bose, Hrishikesh Roy and C.T. Ravikumar, JJ.): The rightto vote is not a civil right – The Right to Vote inevitably follows fromthe inclusion of a person in the electoral roll – According to Art.326, where the citizen is not less than eighteen years and does nothave the disqualifications, he becomes entitled to be entered in theelectoral roll – Such person, as is indicated in Article 326, indeed,has a right, which can be said to be a Constitutional Right, whichmay be right subject to the restriction – Held (Ajay Rastogi, J.) – Byvirtue of Article 326, the right to vote became a constitutional rightgranted to citizens – The said right was given effect by s.62 ofRepresentation of the People (ROP) Act, 1951 – The right to vote isnot just a statutory right – The right to vote is an expression of thechoice of the citizen, which is a fundamental right under Art.19(1)(a)– The right to vote is not limited only to Art.326, but flows throughArts.15, 17, 19, 21 – The right to vote in direct elections is afundamental right, subject to limitations laid down in Art. 326 –The right to vote is not merely a constitutional right, but a componentof Part III of the Constitution.Election Laws: Constitution of India – Art.14 – Rule of Law –Role of Election Commission – Held (per K. M. Joseph, J.) (for himself,Aniruddha Bose, Hrishikesh Roy and C. T. Ravikumar, JJ.): Rule oflaw is the very bedrock of a democratic form of governance – AnElection Commission which does not ensure free and fair poll asper the rules of the game, guarantees the breakdown of thefoundation of the rule of law – Any action or omission by the Election Commission in holding the poll which treats political partieswith an uneven hand and in an unfair or arbitrary manner wouldbe anathema to the mandate of Article 14, and therefore, cause itsbreach.Constitution of India – Art. 142 – Power of the Court to laydown guidelines in order to fill legislative gaps – Held (per AjayRastogi, J.): The Supreme Court has plenary power under Article142 to issue directions to do “complete justice” – The Court hascreated a jurisprudence, where it has exercised its power underArticle 142 to fill legislative gaps – Supreme Court has laid downguidelines in order to fill the legislative gap on a number ofoccasions – Series of case laws authoritatively demonstrate thecommitment of Supreme Court to intervene to preserve and promotethe “Rule of Law”, by supplementing the legislative gaps till theLegislature steps in.",

M. Joseph, J.) (for himself, Aniruddha Bose, Hrishikesh Roy and C. T. Ravikumar, JJ.): Second proviso to Article 324(5) onlyenacts the protection that the Election Commissioner or RegionalCommissioner shall not be removed from Office except on therecommendation of the Chief Election Commissioner – There isequality otherwise, which exists between the Chief ElectionCommissioner and the Election Commissioners in various matters –The argument that the Election Commissioner must be accorded thesame protection as is given to the Chief Election Commissioner,appears to be untenable, on a plain reading of Article 324(5) – Inthe context of the said provision, the words ‘provided further’ cannotbe perceived as an additional protect ion to the ElectionCommissioner – It is for Parliament acting in the constituent capacityto consider whether it would be advisable to extend the protectionto the Election Commissioners so as to safeguard and ensure theindependence of the Election Commissioners as well – Held (perAjay Rastogi, J.) Various reports have recommended that theprotection against removal available to the Chief ElectionCommissioner should be made available to the other ElectionCommissioners to ensure the independence of the ElectionCommission – Keeping in view the importance of maintaining theneutrality and independence of the office of the Election Commissionto hold free and fair election which is a sine qua non for upholdingthe democracy as enshrined in our Constitut ion, it becomesimperative to shield the appointment of Election Commissioners andto be insulated from the executive interference – It is the need of thehour and advisable, to extend the protection available to the ChiefElection Commissioner under the first proviso to Article 324(5) toother Election Commissioners as well until any law is being framedby the Parliament – The conditions of service of the ElectionCommissioners shall not be varied to his disadvantage afterappointment – Election Commission (Conditions of Service ofElection Commissioners and Transaction of Business) Act, 1991.Election Laws: Independent Permanent Secretariat forElection Commission – Expenditure on the Consolidated Fund ofIndia – Held (per K. M. Joseph, J.) (for himself, Aniruddha Bose,Hrishikesh Roy and C. T. Ravikumar): It is a matter of policy – TheElection Commission of India is to perform the arduous andunenviable task of remaining aloof from all forms of subjugationby and interference from the Executive – The Executive can bringan otherwise independent Body to its knees, by starving it off or cutting off the requisite financial wherewithal and resources requiredfor its efficient and independent functioning – One cannot beoblivious to the need for articulation of details in regard to theexpenditure, which is a matter of policy - Urgent need to providefor a permanent Secretariat and also to provide that the expenditurebe charged on the Consolidated Fund of India – It is for the Unionof India to seriously consider bringing in the much-needed change– Union of India /Parliament may consider bringing in the necessarychanges so that the Election Commission of India becomes trulyindependent.Constitution of India – Art. 326 – Representation of the PeopleAct, 1951 – s.62 – Right to Vote – Nature of Right – Whether StatutoryRight or Constitutional Right – Held (per K. M. Joseph, J.) (for himself,Aniruddha Bose, Hrishikesh Roy and C.T. Ravikumar, JJ.): The rightto vote is not a civil right – The Right to Vote inevitably follows fromthe inclusion of a person in the electoral roll – According to Art.326, where the citizen is not less than eighteen years and does nothave the disqualifications, he becomes entitled to be entered in theelectoral roll – Such person, as is indicated in Article 326, indeed,has a right, which can be said to be a Constitutional Right, whichmay be right subject to the restriction – Held (Ajay Rastogi, J.) – Byvirtue of Article 326, the right to vote became a constitutional rightgranted to citizens – The said right was given effect by s.62 ofRepresentation of the People (ROP) Act, 1951 – The right to vote isnot just a statutory right – The right to vote is an expression of thechoice of the citizen, which is a fundamental right under Art.19(1)(a)– The right to vote is not limited only to Art.326, but flows throughArts.15, 17, 19, 21 – The right to vote in direct elections is afundamental right, subject to limitations laid down in Art. 326 –The right to vote is not merely a constitutional right, but a componentof Part III of the Constitution.Election Laws: Constitution of India – Art.14 – Rule of Law –Role of Election Commission – Held (per K. M. Joseph, J.) (for himself,Aniruddha Bose, Hrishikesh Roy and C. T. Ravikumar, JJ.): Rule oflaw is the very bedrock of a democratic form of governance – AnElection Commission which does not ensure free and fair poll asper the rules of the game, guarantees the breakdown of thefoundation of the rule of law – Any action or omission by the Election Commission in holding the poll which treats political partieswith an uneven hand and in an unfair or arbitrary manner wouldbe anathema to the mandate of Article 14, and therefore, cause itsbreach.Constitution of India – Art. 142 – Power of the Court to laydown guidelines in order to fill legislative gaps – Held (per AjayRastogi, J.): The Supreme Court has plenary power under Article142 to issue directions to do “complete justice” – The Court hascreated a jurisprudence, where it has exercised its power underArticle 142 to fill legislative gaps – Supreme Court has laid downguidelines in order to fill the legislative gap on a number ofoccasions – Series of case laws authoritatively demonstrate thecommitment of Supreme Court to intervene to preserve and promotethe “Rule of Law”, by supplementing the legislative gaps till theLegislature steps in.",

        "HeadNote": "Election Laws: Constitution of India – Arts. 324(2), 32 and142 –Appointment of Chief Election Commissioner and ElectionCommissioners – Method of – Independence of Election Commission– Constitutional validity of the practice of Union of India to appointthe members of the Election Commission – Held: The vacuum in thecase of Art.324(2) is the absence of the law which Parliament wascontemplated to enact – This Court is concerned with the devastatingeffect of continuing to leave appointments in the sole hands of theExecutive on fundamental values and also fundamental rights –Time is ripe for the Court to lay down norms – Imperative need forthe Court to step in – Vacuum exists on the basis that unlike otherappointments, it was intended all throughout that appointmentexclusively by the Executive was to be a mere transient or stop gaparrangement and it was to be replaced by a law made by theParliament taking away the exclusive power of the Executive – Thisconclusion is clear and inevitable and the absence of law evenafter seven decades points to the vacuum –As far as appointment tothe posts of Chief Election Commissioner and the ElectionCommissioners are concerned, the same shall be done by thePresident of India on the basis of the advice tendered by a Committeeconsisting of the Prime Minister of India, the Leader of theOpposition in the Lok Sabha and, in case, there is no such Leader,the Leader of the largest Party in the Opposition in the Lok Sabhahaving the largest numerical strength, and the Chief Justice of India– This norm will continue to hold good till a law is made by theParliament.Election Laws: Constitution of India – Art.324(5) – Protectionof Election Commissioner – Whether the Election Commissioner isentitled to same protection as given to Chief Election Commissioner– Held (per K. M. Joseph, J.) (for himself, Aniruddha Bose, Hrishikesh Roy and C. T. Ravikumar, JJ.): Second proviso to Article 324(5) onlyenacts the protection that the Election Commissioner or RegionalCommissioner shall not be removed from Office except on therecommendation of the Chief Election Commissioner – There isequality otherwise, which exists between the Chief ElectionCommissioner and the Election Commissioners in various matters –The argument that the Election Commissioner must be accorded thesame protection as is given to the Chief Election Commissioner,appears to be untenable, on a plain reading of Article 324(5) – Inthe context of the said provision, the words ‘provided further’ cannotbe perceived as an additional protect ion to the ElectionCommissioner – It is for Parliament acting in the constituent capacityto consider whether it would be advisable to extend the protectionto the Election Commissioners so as to safeguard and ensure theindependence of the Election Commissioners as well – Held (perAjay Rastogi, J.) Various reports have recommended that theprotection against removal available to the Chief ElectionCommissioner should be made available to the other ElectionCommissioners to ensure the independence of the ElectionCommission – Keeping in view the importance of maintaining theneutrality and independence of the office of the Election Commissionto hold free and fair election which is a sine qua non for upholdingthe democracy as enshrined in our Constitut ion, it becomesimperative to shield the appointment of Election Commissioners andto be insulated from the executive interference – It is the need of thehour and advisable, to extend the protection available to the ChiefElection Commissioner under the first proviso to Article 324(5) toother Election Commissioners as well until any law is being framedby the Parliament – The conditions of service of the ElectionCommissioners shall not be varied to his disadvantage afterappointment – Election Commission (Conditions of Service ofElection Commissioners and Transaction of Business) Act, 1991.Election Laws: Independent Permanent Secretariat forElection Commission – Expenditure on the Consolidated Fund ofIndia – Held (per K. M. Joseph, J.) (for himself, Aniruddha Bose,Hrishikesh Roy and C. T. Ravikumar): It is a matter of policy – TheElection Commission of India is to perform the arduous andunenviable task of remaining aloof from all forms of subjugationby and interference from the Executive – The Executive can bringan otherwise independent Body to its knees, by starving it off or cutting off the requisite financial wherewithal and resources requiredfor its efficient and independent functioning – One cannot beoblivious to the need for articulation of details in regard to theexpenditure, which is a matter of policy - Urgent need to providefor a permanent Secretariat and also to provide that the expenditurebe charged on the Consolidated Fund of India – It is for the Unionof India to seriously consider bringing in the much-needed change– Union of India /Parliament may consider bringing in the necessarychanges so that the Election Commission of India becomes trulyindependent.Constitution of India – Art. 326 – Representation of the PeopleAct, 1951 – s.62 – Right to Vote – Nature of Right – Whether StatutoryRight or Constitutional Right – Held (per K. M. Joseph, J.) (for himself,Aniruddha Bose, Hrishikesh Roy and C.T. Ravikumar, JJ.): The rightto vote is not a civil right – The Right to Vote inevitably follows fromthe inclusion of a person in the electoral roll – According to Art.326, where the citizen is not less than eighteen years and does nothave the disqualifications, he becomes entitled to be entered in theelectoral roll – Such person, as is indicated in Article 326, indeed,has a right, which can be said to be a Constitutional Right, whichmay be right subject to the restriction – Held (Ajay Rastogi, J.) – Byvirtue of Article 326, the right to vote became a constitutional rightgranted to citizens – The said right was given effect by s.62 ofRepresentation of the People (ROP) Act, 1951 – The right to vote isnot just a statutory right – The right to vote is an expression of thechoice of the citizen, which is a fundamental right under Art.19(1)(a)– The right to vote is not limited only to Art.326, but flows throughArts.15, 17, 19, 21 – The right to vote in direct elections is afundamental right, subject to limitations laid down in Art. 326 –The right to vote is not merely a constitutional right, but a componentof Part III of the Constitution.Election Laws: Constitution of India – Art.14 – Rule of Law –Role of Election Commission – Held (per K. M. Joseph, J.) (for himself,Aniruddha Bose, Hrishikesh Roy and C. T. Ravikumar, JJ.): Rule oflaw is the very bedrock of a democratic form of governance – AnElection Commission which does not ensure free and fair poll asper the rules of the game, guarantees the breakdown of thefoundation of the rule of law – Any action or omission by the Election Commission in holding the poll which treats political partieswith an uneven hand and in an unfair or arbitrary manner wouldbe anathema to the mandate of Article 14, and therefore, cause itsbreach.Constitution of India – Art. 142 – Power of the Court to laydown guidelines in order to fill legislative gaps – Held (per AjayRastogi, J.): The Supreme Court has plenary power under Article142 to issue directions to do “complete justice” – The Court hascreated a jurisprudence, where it has exercised its power underArticle 142 to fill legislative gaps – Supreme Court has laid downguidelines in order to fill the legislative gap on a number ofoccasions – Series of case laws authoritatively demonstrate thecommitment of Supreme Court to intervene to preserve and promotethe “Rule of Law”, by supplementing the legislative gaps till theLegislature steps in.",

M. Joseph, J.) (for himself, Aniruddha Bose, Hrishikesh Roy and C. T. Ravikumar, JJ.): Second proviso to Article 324(5) onlyenacts the protection that the Election Commissioner or RegionalCommissioner shall not be removed from Office except on therecommendation of the Chief Election Commissioner – There isequality otherwise, which exists between the Chief ElectionCommissioner and the Election Commissioners in various matters –The argument that the Election Commissioner must be accorded thesame protection as is given to the Chief Election Commissioner,appears to be untenable, on a plain reading of Article 324(5) – Inthe context of the said provision, the words ‘provided further’ cannotbe perceived as an additional protect ion to the ElectionCommissioner – It is for Parliament acting in the constituent capacityto consider whether it would be advisable to extend the protectionto the Election Commissioners so as to safeguard and ensure theindependence of the Election Commissioners as well – Held (perAjay Rastogi, J.) Various reports have recommended that theprotection against removal available to the Chief ElectionCommissioner should be made available to the other ElectionCommissioners to ensure the independence of the ElectionCommission – Keeping in view the importance of maintaining theneutrality and independence of the office of the Election Commissionto hold free and fair election which is a sine qua non for upholdingthe democracy as enshrined in our Constitut ion, it becomesimperative to shield the appointment of Election Commissioners andto be insulated from the executive interference – It is the need of thehour and advisable, to extend the protection available to the ChiefElection Commissioner under the first proviso to Article 324(5) toother Election Commissioners as well until any law is being framedby the Parliament – The conditions of service of the ElectionCommissioners shall not be varied to his disadvantage afterappointment – Election Commission (Conditions of Service ofElection Commissioners and Transaction of Business) Act, 1991.Election Laws: Independent Permanent Secretariat forElection Commission – Expenditure on the Consolidated Fund ofIndia – Held (per K. M. Joseph, J.) (for himself, Aniruddha Bose,Hrishikesh Roy and C. T. Ravikumar): It is a matter of policy – TheElection Commission of India is to perform the arduous andunenviable task of remaining aloof from all forms of subjugationby and interference from the Executive – The Executive can bringan otherwise independent Body to its knees, by starving it off or cutting off the requisite financial wherewithal and resources requiredfor its efficient and independent functioning – One cannot beoblivious to the need for articulation of details in regard to theexpenditure, which is a matter of policy - Urgent need to providefor a permanent Secretariat and also to provide that the expenditurebe charged on the Consolidated Fund of India – It is for the Unionof India to seriously consider bringing in the much-needed change– Union of India /Parliament may consider bringing in the necessarychanges so that the Election Commission of India becomes trulyindependent.Constitution of India – Art. 326 – Representation of the PeopleAct, 1951 – s.62 – Right to Vote – Nature of Right – Whether StatutoryRight or Constitutional Right – Held (per K. M. Joseph, J.) (for himself,Aniruddha Bose, Hrishikesh Roy and C.T. Ravikumar, JJ.): The rightto vote is not a civil right – The Right to Vote inevitably follows fromthe inclusion of a person in the electoral roll – According to Art.326, where the citizen is not less than eighteen years and does nothave the disqualifications, he becomes entitled to be entered in theelectoral roll – Such person, as is indicated in Article 326, indeed,has a right, which can be said to be a Constitutional Right, whichmay be right subject to the restriction – Held (Ajay Rastogi, J.) – Byvirtue of Article 326, the right to vote became a constitutional rightgranted to citizens – The said right was given effect by s.62 ofRepresentation of the People (ROP) Act, 1951 – The right to vote isnot just a statutory right – The right to vote is an expression of thechoice of the citizen, which is a fundamental right under Art.19(1)(a)– The right to vote is not limited only to Art.326, but flows throughArts.15, 17, 19, 21 – The right to vote in direct elections is afundamental right, subject to limitations laid down in Art. 326 –The right to vote is not merely a constitutional right, but a componentof Part III of the Constitution.Election Laws: Constitution of India – Art.14 – Rule of Law –Role of Election Commission – Held (per K. M. Joseph, J.) (for himself,Aniruddha Bose, Hrishikesh Roy and C. T. Ravikumar, JJ.): Rule oflaw is the very bedrock of a democratic form of governance – AnElection Commission which does not ensure free and fair poll asper the rules of the game, guarantees the breakdown of thefoundation of the rule of law – Any action or omission by the Election Commission in holding the poll which treats political partieswith an uneven hand and in an unfair or arbitrary manner wouldbe anathema to the mandate of Article 14, and therefore, cause itsbreach.Constitution of India – Art. 142 – Power of the Court to laydown guidelines in order to fill legislative gaps – Held (per AjayRastogi, J.): The Supreme Court has plenary power under Article142 to issue directions to do “complete justice” – The Court hascreated a jurisprudence, where it has exercised its power underArticle 142 to fill legislative gaps – Supreme Court has laid downguidelines in order to fill the legislative gap on a number ofoccasions – Series of case laws authoritatively demonstrate thecommitment of Supreme Court to intervene to preserve and promotethe “Rule of Law”, by supplementing the legislative gaps till theLegislature steps in.",

        "HeadNote": "Election Laws: Constitution of India – Arts. 324(2), 32 and142 –Appointment of Chief Election Commissioner and ElectionCommissioners – Method of – Independence of Election Commission– Constitutional validity of the practice of Union of India to appointthe members of the Election Commission – Held: The vacuum in thecase of Art.324(2) is the absence of the law which Parliament wascontemplated to enact – This Court is concerned with the devastatingeffect of continuing to leave appointments in the sole hands of theExecutive on fundamental values and also fundamental rights –Time is ripe for the Court to lay down norms – Imperative need forthe Court to step in – Vacuum exists on the basis that unlike otherappointments, it was intended all throughout that appointmentexclusively by the Executive was to be a mere transient or stop gaparrangement and it was to be replaced by a law made by theParliament taking away the exclusive power of the Executive – Thisconclusion is clear and inevitable and the absence of law evenafter seven decades points to the vacuum –As far as appointment tothe posts of Chief Election Commissioner and the ElectionCommissioners are concerned, the same shall be done by thePresident of India on the basis of the advice tendered by a Committeeconsisting of the Prime Minister of India, the Leader of theOpposition in the Lok Sabha and, in case, there is no such Leader,the Leader of the largest Party in the Opposition in the Lok Sabhahaving the largest numerical strength, and the Chief Justice of India– This norm will continue to hold good till a law is made by theParliament.Election Laws: Constitution of India – Art.324(5) – Protectionof Election Commissioner – Whether the Election Commissioner isentitled to same protection as given to Chief Election Commissioner– Held (per K. M. Joseph, J.) (for himself, Aniruddha Bose, Hrishikesh Roy and C. T. Ravikumar, JJ.): Second proviso to Article 324(5) onlyenacts the protection that the Election Commissioner or RegionalCommissioner shall not be removed from Office except on therecommendation of the Chief Election Commissioner – There isequality otherwise, which exists between the Chief ElectionCommissioner and the Election Commissioners in various matters –The argument that the Election Commissioner must be accorded thesame protection as is given to the Chief Election Commissioner,appears to be untenable, on a plain reading of Article 324(5) – Inthe context of the said provision, the words ‘provided further’ cannotbe perceived as an additional protect ion to the ElectionCommissioner – It is for Parliament acting in the constituent capacityto consider whether it would be advisable to extend the protectionto the Election Commissioners so as to safeguard and ensure theindependence of the Election Commissioners as well – Held (perAjay Rastogi, J.) Various reports have recommended that theprotection against removal available to the Chief ElectionCommissioner should be made available to the other ElectionCommissioners to ensure the independence of the ElectionCommission – Keeping in view the importance of maintaining theneutrality and independence of the office of the Election Commissionto hold free and fair election which is a sine qua non for upholdingthe democracy as enshrined in our Constitut ion, it becomesimperative to shield the appointment of Election Commissioners andto be insulated from the executive interference – It is the need of thehour and advisable, to extend the protection available to the ChiefElection Commissioner under the first proviso to Article 324(5) toother Election Commissioners as well until any law is being framedby the Parliament – The conditions of service of the ElectionCommissioners shall not be varied to his disadvantage afterappointment – Election Commission (Conditions of Service ofElection Commissioners and Transaction of Business) Act, 1991.Election Laws: Independent Permanent Secretariat forElection Commission – Expenditure on the Consolidated Fund ofIndia – Held (per K. M. Joseph, J.) (for himself, Aniruddha Bose,Hrishikesh Roy and C. T. Ravikumar): It is a matter of policy – TheElection Commission of India is to perform the arduous andunenviable task of remaining aloof from all forms of subjugationby and interference from the Executive – The Executive can bringan otherwise independent Body to its knees, by starving it off or cutting off the requisite financial wherewithal and resources requiredfor its efficient and independent functioning – One cannot beoblivious to the need for articulation of details in regard to theexpenditure, which is a matter of policy - Urgent need to providefor a permanent Secretariat and also to provide that the expenditurebe charged on the Consolidated Fund of India – It is for the Unionof India to seriously consider bringing in the much-needed change– Union of India /Parliament may consider bringing in the necessarychanges so that the Election Commission of India becomes trulyindependent.Constitution of India – Art. 326 – Representation of the PeopleAct, 1951 – s.62 – Right to Vote – Nature of Right – Whether StatutoryRight or Constitutional Right – Held (per K. M. Joseph, J.) (for himself,Aniruddha Bose, Hrishikesh Roy and C.T. Ravikumar, JJ.): The rightto vote is not a civil right – The Right to Vote inevitably follows fromthe inclusion of a person in the electoral roll – According to Art.326, where the citizen is not less than eighteen years and does nothave the disqualifications, he becomes entitled to be entered in theelectoral roll – Such person, as is indicated in Article 326, indeed,has a right, which can be said to be a Constitutional Right, whichmay be right subject to the restriction – Held (Ajay Rastogi, J.) – Byvirtue of Article 326, the right to vote became a constitutional rightgranted to citizens – The said right was given effect by s.62 ofRepresentation of the People (ROP) Act, 1951 – The right to vote isnot just a statutory right – The right to vote is an expression of thechoice of the citizen, which is a fundamental right under Art.19(1)(a)– The right to vote is not limited only to Art.326, but flows throughArts.15, 17, 19, 21 – The right to vote in direct elections is afundamental right, subject to limitations laid down in Art. 326 –The right to vote is not merely a constitutional right, but a componentof Part III of the Constitution.Election Laws: Constitution of India – Art.14 – Rule of Law –Role of Election Commission – Held (per K. M. Joseph, J.) (for himself,Aniruddha Bose, Hrishikesh Roy and C. T. Ravikumar, JJ.): Rule oflaw is the very bedrock of a democratic form of governance – AnElection Commission which does not ensure free and fair poll asper the rules of the game, guarantees the breakdown of thefoundation of the rule of law – Any action or omission by the Election Commission in holding the poll which treats political partieswith an uneven hand and in an unfair or arbitrary manner wouldbe anathema to the mandate of Article 14, and therefore, cause itsbreach.Constitution of India – Art. 142 – Power of the Court to laydown guidelines in order to fill legislative gaps – Held (per AjayRastogi, J.): The Supreme Court has plenary power under Article142 to issue directions to do “complete justice” – The Court hascreated a jurisprudence, where it has exercised its power underArticle 142 to fill legislative gaps – Supreme Court has laid downguidelines in order to fill the legislative gap on a number ofoccasions – Series of case laws authoritatively demonstrate thecommitment of Supreme Court to intervene to preserve and promotethe “Rule of Law”, by supplementing the legislative gaps till theLegislature steps in.",

        "HeadNote": "Election Laws: Constitution of India – Arts. 324(2), 32 and142 –Appointment of Chief Election Commissioner and ElectionCommissioners – Method of – Independence of Election Commission– Constitutional validity of the practice of Union of India to appointthe members of the Election Commission – Held: The vacuum in thecase of Art.324(2) is the absence of the law which Parliament wascontemplated to enact – This Court is concerned with the devastatingeffect of continuing to leave appointments in the sole hands of theExecutive on fundamental values and also fundamental rights –Time is ripe for the Court to lay down norms – Imperative need forthe Court to step in – Vacuum exists on the basis that unlike otherappointments, it was intended all throughout that appointmentexclusively by the Executive was to be a mere transient or stop gaparrangement and it was to be replaced by a law made by theParliament taking away the exclusive power of the Executive – Thisconclusion is clear and inevitable and the absence of law evenafter seven decades points to the vacuum –As far as appointment tothe posts of Chief Election Commissioner and the ElectionCommissioners are concerned, the same shall be done by thePresident of India on the basis of the advice tendered by a Committeeconsisting of the Prime Minister of India, the Leader of theOpposition in the Lok Sabha and, in case, there is no such Leader,the Leader of the largest Party in the Opposition in the Lok Sabhahaving the largest numerical strength, and the Chief Justice of India– This norm will continue to hold good till a law is made by theParliament.Election Laws: Constitution of India – Art.324(5) – Protectionof Election Commissioner – Whether the Election Commissioner isentitled to same protection as given to Chief Election Commissioner– Held (per K. M. Joseph, J.) (for himself, Aniruddha Bose, Hrishikesh Roy and C. T. Ravikumar, JJ.): Second proviso to Article 324(5) onlyenacts the protection that the Election Commissioner or RegionalCommissioner shall not be removed from Office except on therecommendation of the Chief Election Commissioner – There isequality otherwise, which exists between the Chief ElectionCommissioner and the Election Commissioners in various matters –The argument that the Election Commissioner must be accorded thesame protection as is given to the Chief Election Commissioner,appears to be untenable, on a plain reading of Article 324(5) – Inthe context of the said provision, the words ‘provided further’ cannotbe perceived as an additional protect ion to the ElectionCommissioner – It is for Parliament acting in the constituent capacityto consider whether it would be advisable to extend the protectionto the Election Commissioners so as to safeguard and ensure theindependence of the Election Commissioners as well – Held (perAjay Rastogi, J.) Various reports have recommended that theprotection against removal available to the Chief ElectionCommissioner should be made available to the other ElectionCommissioners to ensure the independence of the ElectionCommission – Keeping in view the importance of maintaining theneutrality and independence of the office of the Election Commissionto hold free and fair election which is a sine qua non for upholdingthe democracy as enshrined in our Constitut ion, it becomesimperative to shield the appointment of Election Commissioners andto be insulated from the executive interference – It is the need of thehour and advisable, to extend the protection available to the ChiefElection Commissioner under the first proviso to Article 324(5) toother Election Commissioners as well until any law is being framedby the Parliament – The conditions of service of the ElectionCommissioners shall not be varied to his disadvantage afterappointment – Election Commission (Conditions of Service ofElection Commissioners and Transaction of Business) Act, 1991.Election Laws: Independent Permanent Secretariat forElection Commission – Expenditure on the Consolidated Fund ofIndia – Held (per K. M. Joseph, J.) (for himself, Aniruddha Bose,Hrishikesh Roy and C. T. Ravikumar): It is a matter of policy – TheElection Commission of India is to perform the arduous andunenviable task of remaining aloof from all forms of subjugationby and interference from the Executive – The Executive can bringan otherwise independent Body to its knees, by starving it off or cutting off the requisite financial wherewithal and resources requiredfor its efficient and independent functioning – One cannot beoblivious to the need for articulation of details in regard to theexpenditure, which is a matter of policy - Urgent need to providefor a permanent Secretariat and also to provide that the expenditurebe charged on the Consolidated Fund of India – It is for the Unionof India to seriously consider bringing in the much-needed change– Union of India /Parliament may consider bringing in the necessarychanges so that the Election Commission of India becomes trulyindependent.Constitution of India – Art. 326 – Representation of the PeopleAct, 1951 – s.62 – Right to Vote – Nature of Right – Whether StatutoryRight or Constitutional Right – Held (per K. M. Joseph, J.) (for himself,Aniruddha Bose, Hrishikesh Roy and C.T. Ravikumar, JJ.): The rightto vote is not a civil right – The Right to Vote inevitably follows fromthe inclusion of a person in the electoral roll – According to Art.326, where the citizen is not less than eighteen years and does nothave the disqualifications, he becomes entitled to be entered in theelectoral roll – Such person, as is indicated in Article 326, indeed,has a right, which can be said to be a Constitutional Right, whichmay be right subject to the restriction – Held (Ajay Rastogi, J.) – Byvirtue of Article 326, the right to vote became a constitutional rightgranted to citizens – The said right was given effect by s.62 ofRepresentation of the People (ROP) Act, 1951 – The right to vote isnot just a statutory right – The right to vote is an expression of thechoice of the citizen, which is a fundamental right under Art.19(1)(a)– The right to vote is not limited only to Art.326, but flows throughArts.15, 17, 19, 21 – The right to vote in direct elections is afundamental right, subject to limitations laid down in Art. 326 –The right to vote is not merely a constitutional right, but a componentof Part III of the Constitution.Election Laws: Constitution of India – Art.14 – Rule of Law –Role of Election Commission – Held (per K. M. Joseph, J.) (for himself,Aniruddha Bose, Hrishikesh Roy and C. T. Ravikumar, JJ.): Rule oflaw is the very bedrock of a democratic form of governance – AnElection Commission which does not ensure free and fair poll asper the rules of the game, guarantees the breakdown of thefoundation of the rule of law – Any action or omission by the Election Commission in holding the poll which treats political partieswith an uneven hand and in an unfair or arbitrary manner wouldbe anathema to the mandate of Article 14, and therefore, cause itsbreach.Constitution of India – Art. 142 – Power of the Court to laydown guidelines in order to fill legislative gaps – Held (per AjayRastogi, J.): The Supreme Court has plenary power under Article142 to issue directions to do “complete justice” – The Court hascreated a jurisprudence, where it has exercised its power underArticle 142 to fill legislative gaps – Supreme Court has laid downguidelines in order to fill the legislative gap on a number ofoccasions – Series of case laws authoritatively demonstrate thecommitment of Supreme Court to intervene to preserve and promotethe “Rule of Law”, by supplementing the legislative gaps till theLegislature steps in.",

        "HeadNote": "Election Laws: Constitution of India – Arts. 324(2), 32 and142 –Appointment of Chief Election Commissioner and ElectionCommissioners – Method of – Independence of Election Commission– Constitutional validity of the practice of Union of India to appointthe members of the Election Commission – Held: The vacuum in thecase of Art.324(2) is the absence of the law which Parliament wascontemplated to enact – This Court is concerned with the devastatingeffect of continuing to leave appointments in the sole hands of theExecutive on fundamental values and also fundamental rights –Time is ripe for the Court to lay down norms – Imperative need forthe Court to step in – Vacuum exists on the basis that unlike otherappointments, it was intended all throughout that appointmentexclusively by the Executive was to be a mere transient or stop gaparrangement and it was to be replaced by a law made by theParliament taking away the exclusive power of the Executive – Thisconclusion is clear and inevitable and the absence of law evenafter seven decades points to the vacuum –As far as appointment tothe posts of Chief Election Commissioner and the ElectionCommissioners are concerned, the same shall be done by thePresident of India on the basis of the advice tendered by a Committeeconsisting of the Prime Minister of India, the Leader of theOpposition in the Lok Sabha and, in case, there is no such Leader,the Leader of the largest Party in the Opposition in the Lok Sabhahaving the largest numerical strength, and the Chief Justice of India– This norm will continue to hold good till a law is made by theParliament.Election Laws: Constitution of India – Art.324(5) – Protectionof Election Commissioner – Whether the Election Commissioner isentitled to same protection as given to Chief Election Commissioner– Held (per K. M. Joseph, J.) (for himself, Aniruddha Bose, Hrishikesh Roy and C. T. Ravikumar, JJ.): Second proviso to Article 324(5) onlyenacts the protection that the Election Commissioner or RegionalCommissioner shall not be removed from Office except on therecommendation of the Chief Election Commissioner – There isequality otherwise, which exists between the Chief ElectionCommissioner and the Election Commissioners in various matters –The argument that the Election Commissioner must be accorded thesame protection as is given to the Chief Election Commissioner,appears to be untenable, on a plain reading of Article 324(5) – Inthe context of the said provision, the words ‘provided further’ cannotbe perceived as an additional protect ion to the ElectionCommissioner – It is for Parliament acting in the constituent capacityto consider whether it would be advisable to extend the protectionto the Election Commissioners so as to safeguard and ensure theindependence of the Election Commissioners as well – Held (perAjay Rastogi, J.) Various reports have recommended that theprotection against removal available to the Chief ElectionCommissioner should be made available to the other ElectionCommissioners to ensure the independence of the ElectionCommission – Keeping in view the importance of maintaining theneutrality and independence of the office of the Election Commissionto hold free and fair election which is a sine qua non for upholdingthe democracy as enshrined in our Constitut ion, it becomesimperative to shield the appointment of Election Commissioners andto be insulated from the executive interference – It is the need of thehour and advisable, to extend the protection available to the ChiefElection Commissioner under the first proviso to Article 324(5) toother Election Commissioners as well until any law is being framedby the Parliament – The conditions of service of the ElectionCommissioners shall not be varied to his disadvantage afterappointment – Election Commission (Conditions of Service ofElection Commissioners and Transaction of Business) Act, 1991.Election Laws: Independent Permanent Secretariat forElection Commission – Expenditure on the Consolidated Fund ofIndia – Held (per K. M. Joseph, J.) (for himself, Aniruddha Bose,Hrishikesh Roy and C. T. Ravikumar): It is a matter of policy – TheElection Commission of India is to perform the arduous andunenviable task of remaining aloof from all forms of subjugationby and interference from the Executive – The Executive can bringan otherwise independent Body to its knees, by starving it off or cutting off the requisite financial wherewithal and resources requiredfor its efficient and independent functioning – One cannot beoblivious to the need for articulation of details in regard to theexpenditure, which is a matter of policy - Urgent need to providefor a permanent Secretariat and also to provide that the expenditurebe charged on the Consolidated Fund of India – It is for the Unionof India to seriously consider bringing in the much-needed change– Union of India /Parliament may consider bringing in the necessarychanges so that the Election Commission of India becomes trulyindependent.Constitution of India – Art. 326 – Representation of the PeopleAct, 1951 – s.62 – Right to Vote – Nature of Right – Whether StatutoryRight or Constitutional Right – Held (per K. M. Joseph, J.) (for himself,Aniruddha Bose, Hrishikesh Roy and C.T. Ravikumar, JJ.): The rightto vote is not a civil right – The Right to Vote inevitably follows fromthe inclusion of a person in the electoral roll – According to Art.326, where the citizen is not less than eighteen years and does nothave the disqualifications, he becomes entitled to be entered in theelectoral roll – Such person, as is indicated in Article 326, indeed,has a right, which can be said to be a Constitutional Right, whichmay be right subject to the restriction – Held (Ajay Rastogi, J.) – Byvirtue of Article 326, the right to vote became a constitutional rightgranted to citizens – The said right was given effect by s.62 ofRepresentation of the People (ROP) Act, 1951 – The right to vote isnot just a statutory right – The right to vote is an expression of thechoice of the citizen, which is a fundamental right under Art.19(1)(a)– The right to vote is not limited only to Art.326, but flows throughArts.15, 17, 19, 21 – The right to vote in direct elections is afundamental right, subject to limitations laid down in Art. 326 –The right to vote is not merely a constitutional right, but a componentof Part III of the Constitution.Election Laws: Constitution of India – Art.14 – Rule of Law –Role of Election Commission – Held (per K. M. Joseph, J.) (for himself,Aniruddha Bose, Hrishikesh Roy and C. T. Ravikumar, JJ.): Rule oflaw is the very bedrock of a democratic form of governance – AnElection Commission which does not ensure free and fair poll asper the rules of the game, guarantees the breakdown of thefoundation of the rule of law – Any action or omission by the Election Commission in holding the poll which treats political partieswith an uneven hand and in an unfair or arbitrary manner wouldbe anathema to the mandate of Article 14, and therefore, cause itsbreach.Constitution of India – Art. 142 – Power of the Court to laydown guidelines in order to fill legislative gaps – Held (per AjayRastogi, J.): The Supreme Court has plenary power under Article142 to issue directions to do “complete justice” – The Court hascreated a jurisprudence, where it has exercised its power underArticle 142 to fill legislative gaps – Supreme Court has laid downguidelines in order to fill the legislative gap on a number ofoccasions – Series of case laws authoritatively demonstrate thecommitment of Supreme Court to intervene to preserve and promotethe “Rule of Law”, by supplementing the legislative gaps till theLegislature steps in.",
