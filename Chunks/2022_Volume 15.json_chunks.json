        "HeadNote": "Judicial Services – Madhya Pradesh Higher Judicial Services (recruitment and Conditions of Service) Rules, 2017 – Transfer Policy of Madhya Pradesh High Court – Clause 9, 9(a) – Additional District & Sessions Judge – Re-instatement in Service – Whether the resignation of petitioner was voluntary – As per the Petitioner (Additional District and Session Judge), she was sexually harassed by Justice ‘A’ and thereafter she was transferred to other district – She made a representation praying for an extension so that her daughter completes her academic session – Her representation was rejected – Consequent to which she resigned – Judges Inquiry Commission (JIC) cleared Justice ‘A’ of all charges – However, JIC found that the transfer of the petitioner was irregular and the petitioner should be re-instated in the service – Her representation to the Chief Justice of High Court for her reinstatement was rejected by the Full Court twice despite the request made by Supreme Court – Held: The transfer of the petitioner was effected mid-term though she could have very well been transferred in general transfers, to be effected in March-April – Neither the procedure as prescribed under Clause 9 of the Transfer Policy of obtaining the comments from the District Judge and the Portfolio Judge were complied with, nor the Transfer Committee considered the provisions of Clause 9(a) of the Transfer Policy – The rejection of the second representation depicts total non application of mind by the then RG as well as the then Judge of the Transfer Committee of the High Court – Respondent failed to take into consideration the factors, which were required to be considered, while deciding the representation – There is no hesitation in holding that the petitioner has established that her transfer order was in contravention of the Transfer Policy and that the rejection of her two representations, in addition of being contrary to the Transfer Policy, were also arbitrary  – As such, the petitioner had discharged her burden and the onus is shifted on the respondent to show that the petitioner’s transfer order was fair and reasonable in the facts and circumstances of the case – Respondent has failed to discharge its burden – In the peculiar facts and circumstances of the case, the petitioner’s resignation, could not be construed to be voluntary – Therefore, resignation of petitioner is quashed and respondent is directed to re-instate the petitioner. Constitution of India – Art. 12 – High Court as a State – While exercising its functions on the administrative side, the MP High Court would also be a State within the meaning of Article 12 of the Constitution of India",

        "HeadNote": "Income Tax Act, 1961: ss. 132 and 133 – Search and Seizure under – Reason to believe –Assessee during the financial year transferred a sum of 10 Crores to a company –Assessee secured the loan by way of a mortgage of the property –Assessee became director to the company and ceased to be so the next month – Amount of Rs.10 crores was repaid with interest on different dates and after repayment of the loan, mortgage was released- Assessee filed his income-tax return showing the interest income which has been taxed as well – After recording reasons to believe in the satisfaction note, search was conducted in terms of s.132 – Satisfaction note was not supplied to the assessee nor was required to be disclosed in terms of Explanation to s. 132(1) –Assessee challenged the warrant of authorization issued by Revenue – High Court quashed the warrant of authorization –On appeal, held: The view of the High Court that the authorization to search the premises of the assessee is invalid, cannot be sustained –Detailed satisfaction note shows multiple entries in the account books of Company’s Director –Manner in which Director contacted the assessee in Ahmedabad for a loan of Rs.10 crores does not appear to be a normal transaction – Subsequent repayment of mortgage and the interest income reflected in the relevant assessment year appears to be the steps taken by the assessee to give a colour of genuineness –Investmentof Rs.10 crores for a short period was not for earning interest income as the same was repaid in the same assessment year –Revenue intends to investigate the fund trail of the money paid by the assessee– Such belief is not out of hat or whimsical–It was a reasonable belief drawn by the Revenue that the assessee shall not produce or cause to be produced any books of accounts or other documents which would be useful or relevant to the proceedings – Such believe was  not based upon conjectures but on a bona-fide opinion framed in the ordinary conduct of the affairs by the assessee generally\u0002Revenue wishes to find out as to whether amount is an undisclosed income – Sufficiency or inadequacy of the reasons to believe recorded cannot be gone into while considering the validity of an act of authorization to conduct search and seizure – Thus, the High Court not justified in setting aside the authorization of search. s. 132 –Search and seizure under – Principles to be followed – Stated.",

        ],
        "HeadNote": "Code of Civil Procedure, 1908: Ord. XV r.5(as applicable in the State of U.P.) – Striking off defence for failure to deposit the admitted rent – Eviction suit by appellant-lessor against the respondent-lessee on grounds of arrear of rents and damages– Failure of respondent to pay or deposit the due rent – Application u/Ord. XV r.5 for striking off the defence – Allowed by the trial court holding that there was no evidence of payment of rent to the appellant and even if the tenant-landlord relationship is denied, then also application u/Ord. XV r.5 was maintainable – Approved by the revisional court, however, set aside by the High Court holding that respondent was entitled to ‘some indulgence’ – On appeal, held:As per the provision, the defendant is under an obligation to deposit the entire amount admitted by him to be due along with the interest on or before the first hearing and to regularly deposit the monthly amount due within a week of its accrual throughout the pendency of the suit – Consequence of default in making either of these deposit is that the court may strike of his defence – However, court should consider the representation of the defendant if made within 10 days of the first hearing –Such provision has to be been construed liberally; and the expression ‘may’ in regard to the power of the Court to strike out defence has been construed as directory and not mandatory – Power to strike off defence is considered to be discretionary, which is to be exercised with circumspection but, relaxation is reserved for a bonafide tenant – On facts, the respondent has not denied his status as being the lessee and it has clearly been the case of volitional non-performance with nothing left to guess about the defendant’s mood of defiance – No facts or any circumstance is existing on record to find even a remote reason for extending any latitude or relaxation in operation of Ord. XV r. 5 – Conclusion of the High Court could only be said to be an assumptive one, being not supported by any reason – Furthermore, the deposits made belatedly, pursuant to the unsustainable order of the High Court, would not enure benefit to the respondent – Thus, the order of the High Court is set aside.",

Maxims: res ipsa loquitur – Applicability of – On facts, an exhibition organized of such substantial magnitude without proper and adequate safety factors which may endanger the life of the visitors, wherein fire broke and incident claimed lives of 65 persons and left 161 or more with burn injuries – Maxim res ipsa loquitur would be applicable as, rightly found by the Court Commissioner, an act of negligence including negligence of the officers of the State – Finding on cause of fire is not relevant in determining the civil liability. Commission of Inquiry Act, 1952 : ss.2(a), 3 – Appointment of Inquiry Commission under – Held: Commission under the Act shall be appointed either by the Executive or by the Legislature but not by the Judiciary in terms of the provisions of Inquiry Act – On facts, appointment of the Court Commissioner was though to substitute the Commissioner appointed under the Inquiry Act, but under the Inquiry Act, the Court could not appoint a Commissioner – Such power is conferred only on the executive and the legislature – Thus, the jurisdiction exercised in appointing Justice S.B. Sinha (Retd.) was vesting with this Court under Art. 142 of the Constitution –Furthermore, it cannot be said that the appointment of the Court Commissioner was as a Commissioner of Inquiry under the Inquiry Act.",
