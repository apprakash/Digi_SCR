Security and Exchange Board of India (Mutual Funds) Regulations, 1996 – Regulations 40 and 52 – Held: Regulations 40 and 52 need to be read harmoniously – When read together, Regulation 52, authorising and specifying the limit of the fees and expenses payable to the asset management company, would apply only when the scheme is in operation, and not after publication of the notice under Clause (b) to sub-regulation 3 to Regulation 39 resulting in ceasure of any business activities in respect of the scheme to be wound up. Security and Exchange Board of India (Mutual Funds) Regulations, 1996 – Regulation 41 – Applicability – Regulation 41, which deals with the procedure and manner of winding up, applies once the notice under Regulation 39(3)(b) is published and the unitholders’ approval under Regulation 18(15)(c) of the Regulations is received. Security and Exchange Board of India (Mutual Funds) Regulations, 1996 – Regulation 41 – Claim for entitlement to payment of commission under clause (b) to sub-regulation 2 to Regulation 41 – Held: In a given case, some of the recurring expenses mentioned in clause (b) to Regulation 52(4) like audit fee, insurance premium, cost of statutory advertisements, etc., would be covered and would satisfy the requirement of clause (b) to Regulation 41(2) – However, if and only when they fall under and meet the requirement of the expenses connected with the winding up can they be allowed under Regulation 41(2)(b) – Commission payable to the mutual fund distributers is certainly not an expense connected with the winding up of the scheme. Security and Exchange Board of India (Mutual Funds) Regulations, 1996 – Regulation 39(2)(b) and 52(4) (b) – Claim for commission payment by mutual fund distributors as an amount ‘due and payable under the scheme’ , on ground that it was an amount or payment that had accrued before the publication of notices under Regulation 39(2)(b), but was not paid as it was payable in future – Held: Not tenable – The expression ‘due and payable’ has to be interpreted with reference to the context in which the words appear – In the context of the Regulations in question, the expression refers to the present liabilities which may be payable in praesenti or in future – There must be an existing obligation to pay though the appointed date of payment may not have arrived – Clause (b) to Regulation 52(4) refers to recurring expenses, that is, expenses which will recur from time to time – It does not refer to one-time payment which is deferred – The recurring liability is not a present liability, but an obligation which, on satisfaction of certain conditions, may accrue in future – The right to claim commission may not accrue and become due and payable – On and after publication of the winding up notice in terms of Regulation 39(3)(b), the trustees and the asset management company cannot claim any payment on account of recurring expenses under clause (b) to sub- regulation (4) to Regulation 52 – Words and Phrases – Expression ‘due and payable’. Security and Exchange Board of India (Mutual Funds) Regulations, 1996 – Regulation 39(3)(b) and 41 – On publication of notices in terms of Regulation 39(3)(b), the business of the mutual fund comes to a stop and therefore, on and from that date the trail commission is not payable, as the scheme is to be wound up and the money is to be collected and paid to the unitholders, in terms of and as per the mandate of Regulation 41 – Even if a distributor renders some services to the unitholders after publication of the notice under Regulation 39(3)(b), it would not entitle him to claim an amount from the asset management company",

Security and Exchange Board of India (Mutual Funds) Regulations, 1996 – Regulations 40 and 52 – Held: Regulations 40 and 52 need to be read harmoniously – When read together, Regulation 52, authorising and specifying the limit of the fees and expenses payable to the asset management company, would apply only when the scheme is in operation, and not after publication of the notice under Clause (b) to sub-regulation 3 to Regulation 39 resulting in ceasure of any business activities in respect of the scheme to be wound up. Security and Exchange Board of India (Mutual Funds) Regulations, 1996 – Regulation 41 – Applicability – Regulation 41, which deals with the procedure and manner of winding up, applies once the notice under Regulation 39(3)(b) is published and the unitholders’ approval under Regulation 18(15)(c) of the Regulations is received. Security and Exchange Board of India (Mutual Funds) Regulations, 1996 – Regulation 41 – Claim for entitlement to payment of commission under clause (b) to sub-regulation 2 to Regulation 41 – Held: In a given case, some of the recurring expenses mentioned in clause (b) to Regulation 52(4) like audit fee, insurance premium, cost of statutory advertisements, etc., would be covered and would satisfy the requirement of clause (b) to Regulation 41(2) – However, if and only when they fall under and meet the requirement of the expenses connected with the winding up can they be allowed under Regulation 41(2)(b) – Commission payable to the mutual fund distributers is certainly not an expense connected with the winding up of the scheme. Security and Exchange Board of India (Mutual Funds) Regulations, 1996 – Regulation 39(2)(b) and 52(4) (b) – Claim for commission payment by mutual fund distributors as an amount ‘due and payable under the scheme’ , on ground that it was an amount or payment that had accrued before the publication of notices under Regulation 39(2)(b), but was not paid as it was payable in future – Held: Not tenable – The expression ‘due and payable’ has to be interpreted with reference to the context in which the words appear – In the context of the Regulations in question, the expression refers to the present liabilities which may be payable in praesenti or in future – There must be an existing obligation to pay though the appointed date of payment may not have arrived – Clause (b) to Regulation 52(4) refers to recurring expenses, that is, expenses which will recur from time to time – It does not refer to one-time payment which is deferred – The recurring liability is not a present liability, but an obligation which, on satisfaction of certain conditions, may accrue in future – The right to claim commission may not accrue and become due and payable – On and after publication of the winding up notice in terms of Regulation 39(3)(b), the trustees and the asset management company cannot claim any payment on account of recurring expenses under clause (b) to sub- regulation (4) to Regulation 52 – Words and Phrases – Expression ‘due and payable’.

        "HeadNote": "Penal Code, 1860: ss. 120A, 405, 415, 420, 499, 500 – In the instant case the first respondent was employed as a Consultant Neurosurgeon by BGS Apollo Hospital – Consultancy Agreement was entered into between the first respondent and the hospital containing his terms of engagement – One of the terms of the engagement was that either party may terminate the agreement, with or without cause, by giving a prior notice of thirty days – Differences arose between the first respondent and the management of the hospital – First respondent wrote a letter to the General Manager of the hospital alleging that patients referred to him were being diverted to other doctors of the hospital at the enquiry/ reception counter – The services of the first respondent were terminated on 30 May 2014 for inconsistent and unsatisfactory behavior in terms of the Consultancy Agreement – Aggrieved first respondent furnished a representation on 31 May 2014 to the Managing Director of hospital highlighting gross irregularities in the billing of patients and he also alleged that the General Manager had been threatening and maligning him – Thereafter first respondent filed a complaint before Judicial Magistrate – In his complaint, he alleged that the General Manager misused his authority and terminated his services with an oblique and ulterior motive of defaming him – Magistrate took cognizance under ss.120A, 405, 415, 420, 499, and 500 of IPC – Sessions Judge set aside the order of the Magistrate on the ground that the complaint did not disclose the ingredients of the offences of defamation or cheating and that the Magistrate was not competent to take cognizance of the offence punishable under s.420 of the IPC – High Court held that no case was made out against the General Manager under ss.499 and 500 of the IPC however, there were material on record which prima facie disclosed the offences u/ss.405 and 420 of the IPC – Hence instant appeal – Held: The grievance of the first respondent arose from the termination of his services at the hospital and the allegations indicated that there was an improper billing in respect of the surgical services which were rendered by the complainant at the hospital which at the most indicated a breach of terms of the Consultancy Agreement by the General Manager, which was essentially in the nature of a civil dispute – There was no allegation that the complainant was as a consequence induced to deliver any property or to consent that any person shall retain any property or that he was deceived to do or omit to do anything which he would have not done or omitted to do if he was not so deceived – None of the ingredients of the offence of criminal breach of trust were demonstrated on the allegations in the complaint as they stand – First respondent alleged that the General Manager caused breach of trust by issuing grossly irregular bills, which adversely affected his professional fees but an alleged breach of the contractual terms does not ipso facto constitute the offence of the criminal breach of trust without there being a clear case of entrustment – No element of entrustment was prima facie established based on the facts and circumstances of the instant matter.

Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 – s.397(2) – Revisional Jurisdiction of High Court in criminal matter – Scope of – The revisional jurisdiction u/s.397 of CrPC can be exercised against the final order of acquittal or conviction, or an intermediate order not being interlocutory order where the interest of the public justice requires to subvert manifest illegality and to prevent gross miscarriage of justice – In the present case, the order of the trial court declining to mark the statement of the informant as an exhibit is an intermediate order affecting important rights of the parties and cannot be said to be purely of an interlocutory nature – The revisional jurisdiction u/s 397 r/w 401 of CrPC is a discreationary in nature and can be exercised suo motu and there can be no bar on the third party invoking such jurisdiction inviting the attention of the High Court that an occasion to exercise the power has arisen – Since the order of the trial court is not interlocutory in nature and that the bar u/s.397(2) of the CrPC in inapplicable, a criminal revision filed by an appellant-informant against the said order of the trial court was maintainable."

        "HeadNote": "Gujarat Riots – Godhra incident of 27.2.2002, in which large number of Kar-sevaks, returning from Ayodhya, were burnt alive in train bogies – As aftermath of that incident, there was unrest and violence all across the State of Gujarat – A violent mob attacked the inhabitants of one Gulberg Society, killing 69 persons including the husband of appellant – Complaint dated 8.6.2006 of appellant to Director General of Police, Gujarat and other high officials inter alia containing allegations of “larger conspiracy at the highest level” which resulted into causing mass violence across the State during the relevant period – Such allegations founded on the alleged utterances made by the then Chief Minister while addressing the DGP, the then Chief Secretary and other senior officials of the State – Towards this, reference made to meeting held on 27.2.2002 evening in Gandhinagar, as testified in the affidavit of Mr. R.B. Sreekumar, the then Additional Director General of Police (Intelligence) – Reliance placed on report of a private panel of former Judges of Supreme Court titled “Concerned Citizens Tribunal” which referred to testimony before them of late Mr. Haren Pandya, former Minister – Additionally, reliance placed on testimony of Mr. Sanjiv Bhatt, the then Superintendent of Police (Security), who claimed to have attended the meeting convened by the then Chief Minister on 27.2.2002 – Held: The testimony of Mr. Sanjiv Bhatt, Mr. Haren Pandya and also of Mr. R.B. Sreekumar was only to sensationalize and politicize the matters in issue, although, replete with falsehood – There was a coalesced effort of the disgruntled officials of the State of Gujarat alongwith others to create sensation by making revelations which were false to their own knowledge – The falsity of their claims had been fully exposed by the SIT (appointed by Supreme Court) after a thorough investigation – To make out a case of larger criminal conspiracy, it is essential to establish a linkindicative of meeting of minds of the concerned persons for commission of the crime(s), committed during the relevant period across the State – No such link is forthcoming, much less had been unraveled and established in any of the nine cases investigated by the same SIT under the directions of Supreme Court – In light of the timely corrective measures taken by the State Government in right earnest and repeated public assurances given by the then Chief Minister that guilty will be punished for their crime(s), and to maintain peace, it would be beyond comprehension of any person of ordinary prudence to bear suspicion about the meeting of minds of named offenders and hatching of conspiracy by the State at the highest level, as alleged, much less grave or strong suspicion as being the quintessence for sending the accused for trial for an offence of criminal conspiracy – Breakdown of law-and-order situation if for short duration, cannot partake the colour of breakdown of rule of law or constitutional crisis – No fault found with the approach of the SIT in submitting final report for discarding the allegations regarding larger criminal conspiracy (at the highest level) for causing and precipitating mass violence across the State during the relevant period – Decision of the Magistrate in accepting the final report submitted by the SIT, is upheld as it is and the protest petition filed by the appellant is rejected – Submission of appellant regarding infraction of rule of law in the matter of investigation and the approach of the Magistrate and the High Court in dealing with the final report, cannot be countenanced – Penal Code, 1860 – s.302 r/w s.120B, s.193 r/w s.114 and ss.185, 153A, 186 and 187 – Commission of Inquiry Act, 1952 – s.6 – Gujarat Police Act, 1951 – Human Rights Act, 1991. Constitution of India, 1950 – Art. 356 – Failure of Constitutional machinery – Breakdown of law and order – When made out – Held: Mis-governance or failure to maintain law-andorder during a brief period may not be a case of failure of constitutional machinery in the context of tenets embodied in Art.356 – There must be credible evidence regarding State sponsored breakdown of law-and-order situation; not spontaneous or isolated instances or events of failure of State administration to control the situation. Gujarat Riots – Allegations of criminal conspiracy on the part of the State authorities – Forwarding of messages by the intelligence agencies including inaction or lack of effective measures taken by the concerned officials – Effect of – Held: It does not per se imply criminal conspiracy on the part of the State authorities – Inaction of the duty holders to take those messages (of intelligence agencies) to its logical end, cannot be regarded as act of criminal conspiracy unless there is material to provide link regarding the meeting of minds and deliberate act to effectuate a plan to spread mass violence across the State. Gujarat Riots – Allegations of criminal conspiracy on the part of the State authorities – Inaction or failure of some officials of one section of the State administration – Held: Cannot be the basis to infer a pre-planned criminal conspiracy by the authorities of the State Government or to term it as a State sponsored crime (violence).",

        "HeadNote": "Gujarat Riots – Godhra incident of 27.2.2002, in which large number of Kar-sevaks, returning from Ayodhya, were burnt alive in train bogies – As aftermath of that incident, there was unrest and violence all across the State of Gujarat – A violent mob attacked the inhabitants of one Gulberg Society, killing 69 persons including the husband of appellant – Complaint dated 8.6.2006 of appellant to Director General of Police, Gujarat and other high officials inter alia containing allegations of “larger conspiracy at the highest level” which resulted into causing mass violence across the State during the relevant period – Such allegations founded on the alleged utterances made by the then Chief Minister while addressing the DGP, the then Chief Secretary and other senior officials of the State – Towards this, reference made to meeting held on 27.2.2002 evening in Gandhinagar, as testified in the affidavit of Mr. R.B. Sreekumar, the then Additional Director General of Police (Intelligence) – Reliance placed on report of a private panel of former Judges of Supreme Court titled “Concerned Citizens Tribunal” which referred to testimony before them of late Mr. Haren Pandya, former Minister – Additionally, reliance placed on testimony of Mr. Sanjiv Bhatt, the then Superintendent of Police (Security), who claimed to have attended the meeting convened by the then Chief Minister on 27.2.2002 – Held: The testimony of Mr. Sanjiv Bhatt, Mr. Haren Pandya and also of Mr. R.B. Sreekumar was only to sensationalize and politicize the matters in issue, although, replete with falsehood – There was a coalesced effort of the disgruntled officials of the State of Gujarat alongwith others to create sensation by making revelations which were false to their own knowledge – The falsity of their claims had been fully exposed by the SIT (appointed by Supreme Court) after a thorough investigation – To make out a case of larger criminal conspiracy, it is essential to establish a linkindicative of meeting of minds of the concerned persons for commission of the crime(s), committed during the relevant period across the State – No such link is forthcoming, much less had been unraveled and established in any of the nine cases investigated by the same SIT under the directions of Supreme Court – In light of the timely corrective measures taken by the State Government in right earnest and repeated public assurances given by the then Chief Minister that guilty will be punished for their crime(s), and to maintain peace, it would be beyond comprehension of any person of ordinary prudence to bear suspicion about the meeting of minds of named offenders and hatching of conspiracy by the State at the highest level, as alleged, much less grave or strong suspicion as being the quintessence for sending the accused for trial for an offence of criminal conspiracy – Breakdown of law-and-order situation if for short duration, cannot partake the colour of breakdown of rule of law or constitutional crisis – No fault found with the approach of the SIT in submitting final report for discarding the allegations regarding larger criminal conspiracy (at the highest level) for causing and precipitating mass violence across the State during the relevant period – Decision of the Magistrate in accepting the final report submitted by the SIT, is upheld as it is and the protest petition filed by the appellant is rejected – Submission of appellant regarding infraction of rule of law in the matter of investigation and the approach of the Magistrate and the High Court in dealing with the final report, cannot be countenanced – Penal Code, 1860 – s.302 r/w s.120B, s.193 r/w s.114 and ss.185, 153A, 186 and 187 – Commission of Inquiry Act, 1952 – s.6 – Gujarat Police Act, 1951 – Human Rights Act, 1991. Constitution of India, 1950 – Art. 356 – Failure of Constitutional machinery – Breakdown of law and order – When made out – Held: Mis-governance or failure to maintain law-andorder during a brief period may not be a case of failure of constitutional machinery in the context of tenets embodied in Art.356 – There must be credible evidence regarding State sponsored breakdown of law-and-order situation; not spontaneous or isolated instances or events of failure of State administration to control the situation. Gujarat Riots – Allegations of criminal conspiracy on the part of the State authorities – Forwarding of messages by the intelligence agencies including inaction or lack of effective measures taken by the concerned officials – Effect of – Held: It does not per se imply criminal conspiracy on the part of the State authorities – Inaction of the duty holders to take those messages (of intelligence agencies) to its logical end, cannot be regarded as act of criminal conspiracy unless there is material to provide link regarding the meeting of minds and deliberate act to effectuate a plan to spread mass violence across the State. Gujarat Riots – Allegations of criminal conspiracy on the part of the State authorities – Inaction or failure of some officials of one section of the State administration – Held: Cannot be the basis to infer a pre-planned criminal conspiracy by the authorities of the State Government or to term it as a State sponsored crime (violence).",

Sreekumar was only to sensationalize and politicize the matters in issue, although, replete with falsehood – There was a coalesced effort of the disgruntled officials of the State of Gujarat alongwith others to create sensation by making revelations which were false to their own knowledge – The falsity of their claims had been fully exposed by the SIT (appointed by Supreme Court) after a thorough investigation – To make out a case of larger criminal conspiracy, it is essential to establish a linkindicative of meeting of minds of the concerned persons for commission of the crime(s), committed during the relevant period across the State – No such link is forthcoming, much less had been unraveled and established in any of the nine cases investigated by the same SIT under the directions of Supreme Court – In light of the timely corrective measures taken by the State Government in right earnest and repeated public assurances given by the then Chief Minister that guilty will be punished for their crime(s), and to maintain peace, it would be beyond comprehension of any person of ordinary prudence to bear suspicion about the meeting of minds of named offenders and hatching of conspiracy by the State at the highest level, as alleged, much less grave or strong suspicion as being the quintessence for sending the accused for trial for an offence of criminal conspiracy – Breakdown of law-and-order situation if for short duration, cannot partake the colour of breakdown of rule of law or constitutional crisis – No fault found with the approach of the SIT in submitting final report for discarding the allegations regarding larger criminal conspiracy (at the highest level) for causing and precipitating mass violence across the State during the relevant period – Decision of the Magistrate in accepting the final report submitted by the SIT, is upheld as it is and the protest petition filed by the appellant is rejected – Submission of appellant regarding infraction of rule of law in the matter of investigation and the approach of the Magistrate and the High Court in dealing with the final report, cannot be countenanced – Penal Code, 1860 – s.302 r/w s.120B, s.193 r/w s.114 and ss.185, 153A, 186 and 187 – Commission of Inquiry Act, 1952 – s.6 – Gujarat Police Act, 1951 – Human Rights Act, 1991. Constitution of India, 1950 – Art. 356 – Failure of Constitutional machinery – Breakdown of law and order – When made out – Held: Mis-governance or failure to maintain law-andorder during a brief period may not be a case of failure of constitutional machinery in the context of tenets embodied in Art.356 – There must be credible evidence regarding State sponsored breakdown of law-and-order situation; not spontaneous or isolated instances or events of failure of State administration to control the situation. Gujarat Riots – Allegations of criminal conspiracy on the part of the State authorities – Forwarding of messages by the intelligence agencies including inaction or lack of effective measures taken by the concerned officials – Effect of – Held: It does not per se imply criminal conspiracy on the part of the State authorities – Inaction of the duty holders to take those messages (of intelligence agencies) to its logical end, cannot be regarded as act of criminal conspiracy unless there is material to provide link regarding the meeting of minds and deliberate act to effectuate a plan to spread mass violence across the State. Gujarat Riots – Allegations of criminal conspiracy on the part of the State authorities – Inaction or failure of some officials of one section of the State administration – Held: Cannot be the basis to infer a pre-planned criminal conspiracy by the authorities of the State Government or to term it as a State sponsored crime (violence).",

        "HeadNote": "Gujarat Riots – Godhra incident of 27.2.2002, in which large number of Kar-sevaks, returning from Ayodhya, were burnt alive in train bogies – As aftermath of that incident, there was unrest and violence all across the State of Gujarat – A violent mob attacked the inhabitants of one Gulberg Society, killing 69 persons including the husband of appellant – Complaint dated 8.6.2006 of appellant to Director General of Police, Gujarat and other high officials inter alia containing allegations of “larger conspiracy at the highest level” which resulted into causing mass violence across the State during the relevant period – Such allegations founded on the alleged utterances made by the then Chief Minister while addressing the DGP, the then Chief Secretary and other senior officials of the State – Towards this, reference made to meeting held on 27.2.2002 evening in Gandhinagar, as testified in the affidavit of Mr. R.B. Sreekumar, the then Additional Director General of Police (Intelligence) – Reliance placed on report of a private panel of former Judges of Supreme Court titled “Concerned Citizens Tribunal” which referred to testimony before them of late Mr. Haren Pandya, former Minister – Additionally, reliance placed on testimony of Mr. Sanjiv Bhatt, the then Superintendent of Police (Security), who claimed to have attended the meeting convened by the then Chief Minister on 27.2.2002 – Held: The testimony of Mr. Sanjiv Bhatt, Mr. Haren Pandya and also of Mr. R.B. Sreekumar was only to sensationalize and politicize the matters in issue, although, replete with falsehood – There was a coalesced effort of the disgruntled officials of the State of Gujarat alongwith others to create sensation by making revelations which were false to their own knowledge – The falsity of their claims had been fully exposed by the SIT (appointed by Supreme Court) after a thorough investigation – To make out a case of larger criminal conspiracy, it is essential to establish a linkindicative of meeting of minds of the concerned persons for commission of the crime(s), committed during the relevant period across the State – No such link is forthcoming, much less had been unraveled and established in any of the nine cases investigated by the same SIT under the directions of Supreme Court – In light of the timely corrective measures taken by the State Government in right earnest and repeated public assurances given by the then Chief Minister that guilty will be punished for their crime(s), and to maintain peace, it would be beyond comprehension of any person of ordinary prudence to bear suspicion about the meeting of minds of named offenders and hatching of conspiracy by the State at the highest level, as alleged, much less grave or strong suspicion as being the quintessence for sending the accused for trial for an offence of criminal conspiracy – Breakdown of law-and-order situation if for short duration, cannot partake the colour of breakdown of rule of law or constitutional crisis – No fault found with the approach of the SIT in submitting final report for discarding the allegations regarding larger criminal conspiracy (at the highest level) for causing and precipitating mass violence across the State during the relevant period – Decision of the Magistrate in accepting the final report submitted by the SIT, is upheld as it is and the protest petition filed by the appellant is rejected – Submission of appellant regarding infraction of rule of law in the matter of investigation and the approach of the Magistrate and the High Court in dealing with the final report, cannot be countenanced – Penal Code, 1860 – s.302 r/w s.120B, s.193 r/w s.114 and ss.185, 153A, 186 and 187 – Commission of Inquiry Act, 1952 – s.6 – Gujarat Police Act, 1951 – Human Rights Act, 1991. Constitution of India, 1950 – Art. 356 – Failure of Constitutional machinery – Breakdown of law and order – When made out – Held: Mis-governance or failure to maintain law-andorder during a brief period may not be a case of failure of constitutional machinery in the context of tenets embodied in Art.356 – There must be credible evidence regarding State sponsored breakdown of law-and-order situation; not spontaneous or isolated instances or events of failure of State administration to control the situation. Gujarat Riots – Allegations of criminal conspiracy on the part of the State authorities – Forwarding of messages by the intelligence agencies including inaction or lack of effective measures taken by the concerned officials – Effect of – Held: It does not per se imply criminal conspiracy on the part of the State authorities – Inaction of the duty holders to take those messages (of intelligence agencies) to its logical end, cannot be regarded as act of criminal conspiracy unless there is material to provide link regarding the meeting of minds and deliberate act to effectuate a plan to spread mass violence across the State. Gujarat Riots – Allegations of criminal conspiracy on the part of the State authorities – Inaction or failure of some officials of one section of the State administration – Held: Cannot be the basis to infer a pre-planned criminal conspiracy by the authorities of the State Government or to term it as a State sponsored crime (violence).",

        "HeadNote": "Gujarat Riots – Godhra incident of 27.2.2002, in which large number of Kar-sevaks, returning from Ayodhya, were burnt alive in train bogies – As aftermath of that incident, there was unrest and violence all across the State of Gujarat – A violent mob attacked the inhabitants of one Gulberg Society, killing 69 persons including the husband of appellant – Complaint dated 8.6.2006 of appellant to Director General of Police, Gujarat and other high officials inter alia containing allegations of “larger conspiracy at the highest level” which resulted into causing mass violence across the State during the relevant period – Such allegations founded on the alleged utterances made by the then Chief Minister while addressing the DGP, the then Chief Secretary and other senior officials of the State – Towards this, reference made to meeting held on 27.2.2002 evening in Gandhinagar, as testified in the affidavit of Mr. R.B. Sreekumar, the then Additional Director General of Police (Intelligence) – Reliance placed on report of a private panel of former Judges of Supreme Court titled “Concerned Citizens Tribunal” which referred to testimony before them of late Mr. Haren Pandya, former Minister – Additionally, reliance placed on testimony of Mr. Sanjiv Bhatt, the then Superintendent of Police (Security), who claimed to have attended the meeting convened by the then Chief Minister on 27.2.2002 – Held: The testimony of Mr. Sanjiv Bhatt, Mr. Haren Pandya and also of Mr. R.B. Sreekumar was only to sensationalize and politicize the matters in issue, although, replete with falsehood – There was a coalesced effort of the disgruntled officials of the State of Gujarat alongwith others to create sensation by making revelations which were false to their own knowledge – The falsity of their claims had been fully exposed by the SIT (appointed by Supreme Court) after a thorough investigation – To make out a case of larger criminal conspiracy, it is essential to establish a linkindicative of meeting of minds of the concerned persons for commission of the crime(s), committed during the relevant period across the State – No such link is forthcoming, much less had been unraveled and established in any of the nine cases investigated by the same SIT under the directions of Supreme Court – In light of the timely corrective measures taken by the State Government in right earnest and repeated public assurances given by the then Chief Minister that guilty will be punished for their crime(s), and to maintain peace, it would be beyond comprehension of any person of ordinary prudence to bear suspicion about the meeting of minds of named offenders and hatching of conspiracy by the State at the highest level, as alleged, much less grave or strong suspicion as being the quintessence for sending the accused for trial for an offence of criminal conspiracy – Breakdown of law-and-order situation if for short duration, cannot partake the colour of breakdown of rule of law or constitutional crisis – No fault found with the approach of the SIT in submitting final report for discarding the allegations regarding larger criminal conspiracy (at the highest level) for causing and precipitating mass violence across the State during the relevant period – Decision of the Magistrate in accepting the final report submitted by the SIT, is upheld as it is and the protest petition filed by the appellant is rejected – Submission of appellant regarding infraction of rule of law in the matter of investigation and the approach of the Magistrate and the High Court in dealing with the final report, cannot be countenanced – Penal Code, 1860 – s.302 r/w s.120B, s.193 r/w s.114 and ss.185, 153A, 186 and 187 – Commission of Inquiry Act, 1952 – s.6 – Gujarat Police Act, 1951 – Human Rights Act, 1991. Constitution of India, 1950 – Art. 356 – Failure of Constitutional machinery – Breakdown of law and order – When made out – Held: Mis-governance or failure to maintain law-andorder during a brief period may not be a case of failure of constitutional machinery in the context of tenets embodied in Art.356 – There must be credible evidence regarding State sponsored breakdown of law-and-order situation; not spontaneous or isolated instances or events of failure of State administration to control the situation. Gujarat Riots – Allegations of criminal conspiracy on the part of the State authorities – Forwarding of messages by the intelligence agencies including inaction or lack of effective measures taken by the concerned officials – Effect of – Held: It does not per se imply criminal conspiracy on the part of the State authorities – Inaction of the duty holders to take those messages (of intelligence agencies) to its logical end, cannot be regarded as act of criminal conspiracy unless there is material to provide link regarding the meeting of minds and deliberate act to effectuate a plan to spread mass violence across the State. Gujarat Riots – Allegations of criminal conspiracy on the part of the State authorities – Inaction or failure of some officials of one section of the State administration – Held: Cannot be the basis to infer a pre-planned criminal conspiracy by the authorities of the State Government or to term it as a State sponsored crime (violence).",

        "HeadNote": "Gujarat Riots – Godhra incident of 27.2.2002, in which large number of Kar-sevaks, returning from Ayodhya, were burnt alive in train bogies – As aftermath of that incident, there was unrest and violence all across the State of Gujarat – A violent mob attacked the inhabitants of one Gulberg Society, killing 69 persons including the husband of appellant – Complaint dated 8.6.2006 of appellant to Director General of Police, Gujarat and other high officials inter alia containing allegations of “larger conspiracy at the highest level” which resulted into causing mass violence across the State during the relevant period – Such allegations founded on the alleged utterances made by the then Chief Minister while addressing the DGP, the then Chief Secretary and other senior officials of the State – Towards this, reference made to meeting held on 27.2.2002 evening in Gandhinagar, as testified in the affidavit of Mr. R.B. Sreekumar, the then Additional Director General of Police (Intelligence) – Reliance placed on report of a private panel of former Judges of Supreme Court titled “Concerned Citizens Tribunal” which referred to testimony before them of late Mr. Haren Pandya, former Minister – Additionally, reliance placed on testimony of Mr. Sanjiv Bhatt, the then Superintendent of Police (Security), who claimed to have attended the meeting convened by the then Chief Minister on 27.2.2002 – Held: The testimony of Mr. Sanjiv Bhatt, Mr. Haren Pandya and also of Mr. R.B. Sreekumar was only to sensationalize and politicize the matters in issue, although, replete with falsehood – There was a coalesced effort of the disgruntled officials of the State of Gujarat alongwith others to create sensation by making revelations which were false to their own knowledge – The falsity of their claims had been fully exposed by the SIT (appointed by Supreme Court) after a thorough investigation – To make out a case of larger criminal conspiracy, it is essential to establish a linkindicative of meeting of minds of the concerned persons for commission of the crime(s), committed during the relevant period across the State – No such link is forthcoming, much less had been unraveled and established in any of the nine cases investigated by the same SIT under the directions of Supreme Court – In light of the timely corrective measures taken by the State Government in right earnest and repeated public assurances given by the then Chief Minister that guilty will be punished for their crime(s), and to maintain peace, it would be beyond comprehension of any person of ordinary prudence to bear suspicion about the meeting of minds of named offenders and hatching of conspiracy by the State at the highest level, as alleged, much less grave or strong suspicion as being the quintessence for sending the accused for trial for an offence of criminal conspiracy – Breakdown of law-and-order situation if for short duration, cannot partake the colour of breakdown of rule of law or constitutional crisis – No fault found with the approach of the SIT in submitting final report for discarding the allegations regarding larger criminal conspiracy (at the highest level) for causing and precipitating mass violence across the State during the relevant period – Decision of the Magistrate in accepting the final report submitted by the SIT, is upheld as it is and the protest petition filed by the appellant is rejected – Submission of appellant regarding infraction of rule of law in the matter of investigation and the approach of the Magistrate and the High Court in dealing with the final report, cannot be countenanced – Penal Code, 1860 – s.302 r/w s.120B, s.193 r/w s.114 and ss.185, 153A, 186 and 187 – Commission of Inquiry Act, 1952 – s.6 – Gujarat Police Act, 1951 – Human Rights Act, 1991. Constitution of India, 1950 – Art. 356 – Failure of Constitutional machinery – Breakdown of law and order – When made out – Held: Mis-governance or failure to maintain law-andorder during a brief period may not be a case of failure of constitutional machinery in the context of tenets embodied in Art.356 – There must be credible evidence regarding State sponsored breakdown of law-and-order situation; not spontaneous or isolated instances or events of failure of State administration to control the situation. Gujarat Riots – Allegations of criminal conspiracy on the part of the State authorities – Forwarding of messages by the intelligence agencies including inaction or lack of effective measures taken by the concerned officials – Effect of – Held: It does not per se imply criminal conspiracy on the part of the State authorities – Inaction of the duty holders to take those messages (of intelligence agencies) to its logical end, cannot be regarded as act of criminal conspiracy unless there is material to provide link regarding the meeting of minds and deliberate act to effectuate a plan to spread mass violence across the State. Gujarat Riots – Allegations of criminal conspiracy on the part of the State authorities – Inaction or failure of some officials of one section of the State administration – Held: Cannot be the basis to infer a pre-planned criminal conspiracy by the authorities of the State Government or to term it as a State sponsored crime (violence).",

Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 – Prosecution on notional basis or assumption – If permissible – Held: The Authorities under the Act cannot prosecute any person on notional basis or on the assumption that a scheduled offence has been committed, unless it is so registered with the jurisdictional police and/or pending enquiry/trial including by way of criminal complaint before the competent forum.

Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 – s.45 – Validity – The provision in the form of s.45, as applicable post amendment of 2018, is reasonable and has direct nexus with the purposes and objects sought to be achieved by the 2002 Act and does not suffer from the vice of arbitrariness or unreasonableness.

Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 – Enforcement Directorate (ED) Manual – Held: Even when ED manual is not to be published being an internal departmental document issued for the guidance of the Authorities (ED officials), the department ought to explore the desirability of placing information on its website which may broadly outline the scope of the authority of the functionaries under the Act and measures to be adopted by them as also the options/ remedies available to the person concerned before the Authority and before the Special Court.

Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 – s.2(1), Clause (na) –Expression “investigation” therein – Held: The expression “investigation” in Clause (na) of s.2(1) does not limit itself to the matter of investigation concerning the offence under the Act and is interchangeable with the function of “inquiry” to be undertaken by the Authorities under the Act. Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 – s.2(1), Clause (u), Explanation – Held: Explanation inserted to Clause (u) of s.2(1) does not travel beyond the main provision predicating tracking and reaching upto the property derived or obtained directly or indirectly as a result of criminal activity relating to a scheduled offence. Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 – s.3 – Ambit of – Held: s.3 has a wider reach and captures every process and activity, direct or indirect, in dealing with the proceeds of crime and is not limited to the happening of the final act of integration of tainted property in the formal economy – Explanation inserted to s.3 by way of amendment of 2019 does not expand the purport of s.3 but is only clarificatory in nature – The expression “and” occurring in s.3 has to be construed as “or”, to give full play to the said provision so as to include “every” process or activity indulged into by anyone – The interpretation suggested, that only upon projecting or claiming the property in question as untainted property that the offence of s.3 would be complete, is rejected. Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 – Prosecution on notional basis or assumption – If permissible – Held: The Authorities under the Act cannot prosecute any person on notional basis or on the assumption that a scheduled offence has been committed, unless it is so registered with the jurisdictional police and/or pending enquiry/trial including by way of criminal complaint before the competent forum. Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 – s.5 – Validity of – Held: s.5 is constitutionally valid – It provides for a balancing arrangement to secure the interests of the person as also ensures that the proceeds of crime remain available to be dealt with in the manner provided by the Act.

Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 – Prosecution on notional basis or assumption – If permissible – Held: The Authorities under the Act cannot prosecute any person on notional basis or on the assumption that a scheduled offence has been committed, unless it is so registered with the jurisdictional police and/or pending enquiry/trial including by way of criminal complaint before the competent forum."

Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 – Enforcement Directorate (ED) Manual – Held: Even when ED manual is not to be published being an internal departmental document issued for the guidance of the Authorities (ED officials), the department ought to explore the desirability of placing information on its website which may broadly outline the scope of the authority of the functionaries under the Act and measures to be adopted by them as also the options/ remedies available to the person concerned before the Authority and before the Special Court.

Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 – s.2(1), Clause (na) –Expression “investigation” therein – Held: The expression “investigation” in Clause (na) of s.2(1) does not limit itself to the matter of investigation concerning the offence under the Act and is interchangeable with the function of “inquiry” to be undertaken by the Authorities under the Act.

Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 – Prosecution on notional basis or assumption – If permissible – Held: The Authorities under the Act cannot prosecute any person on notional basis or on the assumption that a scheduled offence has been committed, unless it is so registered with the jurisdictional police and/or pending enquiry/trial including by way of criminal complaint before the competent forum.

Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 – s.45 – Validity – The provision in the form of s.45, as applicable post amendment of 2018, is reasonable and has direct nexus with the purposes and objects sought to be achieved by the 2002 Act and does not suffer from the vice of arbitrariness or unreasonableness. Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 – s.45 – Applicability – Prayer for bail – Held: As regards the prayer for grant of bail, irrespective of the nature of proceedings, including those under s.438 CrPC or even upon invoking the jurisdiction of Constitutional Courts, the underlying principles and rigours of s.45 may apply – Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 – s.438.

Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 – Schedule to the Act – Inclusion or exclusion of any particular offence – Held: The inclusion or exclusion of any particular offence in the Schedule to the Act is a matter of legislative policy –The nature or class of any predicate offence has no bearing on the validity of the Schedule or any prescription thereunder. Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 – s.48 – Enforcement Case Information Report (ECIR) – Held: ECIR cannot be equated with an FIR under CrPC – ECIR is an internal document of the Enforcement Directorate (ED) – Fact that FIR in respect of scheduled offence has not been recorded does not come in the way of the Authorities referred to in s.48 to commence inquiry/ investigation for initiating “civil action” of “provisional attachment” of property being proceeds of crime – FIR. Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 – Enforcement Case Information Report (ECIR) – Held: Supply of a copy of ECIR in every case to the person concerned is not mandatory, it is enough if Enforcement Directorate (ED) at the time of arrest, discloses the grounds of such arrest – However, when the arrested person is produced before the Special Court, it is open to the Special Court to look into the relevant records presented by the authorised representative of ED for answering the issue of need for his/her continued detention in connection with the offence of moneylaundering. Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 – Enforcement Directorate (ED) Manual – Held: Even when ED manual is not to be published being an internal departmental document issued for the guidance of the Authorities (ED officials), the department ought to explore the desirability of placing information on its website which may broadly outline the scope of the authority of the functionaries under the Act and measures to be adopted by them as also the options/ remedies available to the person concerned before the Authority and before the Special Court. Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 – Vacancies in Appellate Tribunal – Executive to take corrective measures in this regard expeditiously. Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 – Argument about proportionality of punishment with reference to the nature of scheduled offence – Held: Is wholly unfounded.",

Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 – s.2(1), Clause (na) –Expression “investigation” therein – Held: The expression “investigation” in Clause (na) of s.2(1) does not limit itself to the matter of investigation concerning the offence under the Act and is interchangeable with the function of “inquiry” to be undertaken by the Authorities under the Act. Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 – s.2(1), Clause (u), Explanation – Held: Explanation inserted to Clause (u) of s.2(1) does not travel beyond the main provision predicating tracking and reaching upto the property derived or obtained directly or indirectly as a result of criminal activity relating to a scheduled offence. Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 – s.3 – Ambit of – Held: s.3 has a wider reach and captures every process and activity, direct or indirect, in dealing with the proceeds of crime and is not limited to the happening of the final act of integration of tainted property in the formal economy – Explanation inserted to s.3 by way of amendment of 2019 does not expand the purport of s.3 but is only clarificatory in nature – The expression “and” occurring in s.3 has to be construed as “or”, to give full play to the said provision so as to include “every” process or activity indulged into by anyone – The interpretation suggested, that only upon projecting or claiming the property in question as untainted property that the offence of s.3 would be complete, is rejected. Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 – Prosecution on notional basis or assumption – If permissible – Held: The Authorities under the Act cannot prosecute any person on notional basis or on the assumption that a scheduled offence has been committed, unless it is so registered with the jurisdictional police and/or pending enquiry/trial including by way of criminal complaint before the competent forum.

Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 – s.17 – Challenge to deletion of proviso to sub-section (1) of s.17 – Rejected – Held: There are stringent safeguards provided in s.17 and Rules framed thereunder – Moreover, the pre-condition in the proviso to Rule 3(2) of the 2005 Rules cannot be read into s.17 after its amendment.

Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 – s.45 – Validity – The provision in the form of s.45, as applicable post amendment of 2018, is reasonable and has direct nexus with the purposes and objects sought to be achieved by the 2002 Act and does not suffer from the vice of arbitrariness or unreasonableness. Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 – s.45 – Applicability – Prayer for bail – Held: As regards the prayer for grant of bail, irrespective of the nature of proceedings, including those under s.438 CrPC or even upon invoking the jurisdiction of Constitutional Courts, the underlying principles and rigours of s.45 may apply – Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 – s.438.

Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 – Statements recorded by Authorities under the Act – Held: They are not hit by Art.20(3) or Art.21 of the Constitution – Constitution of India, 1950 – Arts. 20(3) and 21.

Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 – Schedule to the Act – Inclusion or exclusion of any particular offence – Held: The inclusion or exclusion of any particular offence in the Schedule to the Act is a matter of legislative policy –The nature or class of any predicate offence has no bearing on the validity of the Schedule or any prescription thereunder. Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 – s.48 – Enforcement Case Information Report (ECIR) – Held: ECIR cannot be equated with an FIR under CrPC – ECIR is an internal document of the Enforcement Directorate (ED) – Fact that FIR in respect of scheduled offence has not been recorded does not come in the way of the Authorities referred to in s.48 to commence inquiry/ investigation for initiating “civil action” of “provisional attachment” of property being proceeds of crime – FIR. Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 – Enforcement Case Information Report (ECIR) – Held: Supply of a copy of ECIR in every case to the person concerned is not mandatory, it is enough if Enforcement Directorate (ED) at the time of arrest, discloses the grounds of such arrest – However, when the arrested person is produced before the Special Court, it is open to the Special Court to look into the relevant records presented by the authorised representative of ED for answering the issue of need for his/her continued detention in connection with the offence of moneylaundering. Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 – Enforcement Directorate (ED) Manual – Held: Even when ED manual is not to be published being an internal departmental document issued for the guidance of the Authorities (ED officials), the department ought to explore the desirability of placing information on its website which may broadly outline the scope of the authority of the functionaries under the Act and measures to be adopted by them as also the options/ remedies available to the person concerned before the Authority and before the Special Court. Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 – Vacancies in Appellate Tribunal – Executive to take corrective measures in this regard expeditiously. Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 – Argument about proportionality of punishment with reference to the nature of scheduled offence – Held: Is wholly unfounded.",

Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 – Prosecution on notional basis or assumption – If permissible – Held: The Authorities under the Act cannot prosecute any person on notional basis or on the assumption that a scheduled offence has been committed, unless it is so registered with the jurisdictional police and/or pending enquiry/trial including by way of criminal complaint before the competent forum.

Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 – s.45 – Validity – The provision in the form of s.45, as applicable post amendment of 2018, is reasonable and has direct nexus with the purposes and objects sought to be achieved by the 2002 Act and does not suffer from the vice of arbitrariness or unreasonableness. Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 – s.45 – Applicability – Prayer for bail – Held: As regards the prayer for grant of bail, irrespective of the nature of proceedings, including those under s.438 CrPC or even upon invoking the jurisdiction of Constitutional Courts, the underlying principles and rigours of s.45 may apply – Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 – s.438.

Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 – s.48 – Enforcement Case Information Report (ECIR) – Held: ECIR cannot be equated with an FIR under CrPC – ECIR is an internal document of the Enforcement Directorate (ED) – Fact that FIR in respect of scheduled offence has not been recorded does not come in the way of the Authorities referred to in s.48 to commence inquiry/ investigation for initiating “civil action” of “provisional attachment” of property being proceeds of crime – FIR. Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 – Enforcement Case Information Report (ECIR) – Held: Supply of a copy of ECIR in every case to the person concerned is not mandatory, it is enough if Enforcement Directorate (ED) at the time of arrest, discloses the grounds of such arrest – However, when the arrested person is produced before the Special Court, it is open to the Special Court to look into the relevant records presented by the authorised representative of ED for answering the issue of need for his/her continued detention in connection with the offence of moneylaundering. Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 – Enforcement Directorate (ED) Manual – Held: Even when ED manual is not to be published being an internal departmental document issued for the guidance of the Authorities (ED officials), the department ought to explore the desirability of placing information on its website which may broadly outline the scope of the authority of the functionaries under the Act and measures to be adopted by them as also the options/ remedies available to the person concerned before the Authority and before the Special Court. Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 – Vacancies in Appellate Tribunal – Executive to take corrective measures in this regard expeditiously.

Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 – s.3 – Ambit of – Held: s.3 has a wider reach and captures every process and activity, direct or indirect, in dealing with the proceeds of crime and is not limited to the happening of the final act of integration of tainted property in the formal economy – Explanation inserted to s.3 by way of amendment of 2019 does not expand the purport of s.3 but is only clarificatory in nature – The expression “and” occurring in s.3 has to be construed as “or”, to give full play to the said provision so as to include “every” process or activity indulged into by anyone – The interpretation suggested, that only upon projecting or claiming the property in question as untainted property that the offence of s.3 would be complete, is rejected. Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 – Prosecution on notional basis or assumption – If permissible – Held: The Authorities under the Act cannot prosecute any person on notional basis or on the assumption that a scheduled offence has been committed, unless it is so registered with the jurisdictional police and/or pending enquiry/trial including by way of criminal complaint before the competent forum.

Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 – s.17 – Challenge to deletion of proviso to sub-section (1) of s.17 – Rejected – Held: There are stringent safeguards provided in s.17 and Rules framed thereunder – Moreover, the pre-condition in the proviso to Rule 3(2) of the 2005 Rules cannot be read into s.17 after its amendment.

Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 – s.45 – Validity – The provision in the form of s.45, as applicable post amendment of 2018, is reasonable and has direct nexus with the purposes and objects sought to be achieved by the 2002 Act and does not suffer from the vice of arbitrariness or unreasonableness.

Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 – Statements recorded by Authorities under the Act – Held: They are not hit by Art.20(3) or Art.21 of the Constitution – Constitution of India, 1950 – Arts. 20(3) and 21.

Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 – Schedule to the Act – Inclusion or exclusion of any particular offence – Held: The inclusion or exclusion of any particular offence in the Schedule to the Act is a matter of legislative policy –The nature or class of any predicate offence has no bearing on the validity of the Schedule or any prescription thereunder. Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 – s.48 – Enforcement Case Information Report (ECIR) – Held: ECIR cannot be equated with an FIR under CrPC – ECIR is an internal document of the Enforcement Directorate (ED) – Fact that FIR in respect of scheduled offence has not been recorded does not come in the way of the Authorities referred to in s.48 to commence inquiry/ investigation for initiating “civil action” of “provisional attachment” of property being proceeds of crime – FIR. Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 – Enforcement Case Information Report (ECIR) – Held: Supply of a copy of ECIR in every case to the person concerned is not mandatory, it is enough if Enforcement Directorate (ED) at the time of arrest, discloses the grounds of such arrest – However, when the arrested person is produced before the Special Court, it is open to the Special Court to look into the relevant records presented by the authorised representative of ED for answering the issue of need for his/her continued detention in connection with the offence of moneylaundering. Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 – Enforcement Directorate (ED) Manual – Held: Even when ED manual is not to be published being an internal departmental document issued for the guidance of the Authorities (ED officials), the department ought to explore the desirability of placing information on its website which may broadly outline the scope of the authority of the functionaries under the Act and measures to be adopted by them as also the options/ remedies available to the person concerned before the Authority and before the Special Court. Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 – Vacancies in Appellate Tribunal – Executive to take corrective measures in this regard expeditiously. Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 – Argument about proportionality of punishment with reference to the nature of scheduled offence – Held: Is wholly unfounded.",

Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 – s.2(1), Clause (na) –Expression “investigation” therein – Held: The expression “investigation” in Clause (na) of s.2(1) does not limit itself to the matter of investigation concerning the offence under the Act and is interchangeable with the function of “inquiry” to be undertaken by the Authorities under the Act.

Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 – Prosecution on notional basis or assumption – If permissible – Held: The Authorities under the Act cannot prosecute any person on notional basis or on the assumption that a scheduled offence has been committed, unless it is so registered with the jurisdictional police and/or pending enquiry/trial including by way of criminal complaint before the competent forum.

Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 – s.45 – Validity – The provision in the form of s.45, as applicable post amendment of 2018, is reasonable and has direct nexus with the purposes and objects sought to be achieved by the 2002 Act and does not suffer from the vice of arbitrariness or unreasonableness. Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 – s.45 – Applicability – Prayer for bail – Held: As regards the prayer for grant of bail, irrespective of the nature of proceedings, including those under s.438 CrPC or even upon invoking the jurisdiction of Constitutional Courts, the underlying principles and rigours of s.45 may apply – Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 – s.438.

Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 – s.48 – Enforcement Case Information Report (ECIR) – Held: ECIR cannot be equated with an FIR under CrPC – ECIR is an internal document of the Enforcement Directorate (ED) – Fact that FIR in respect of scheduled offence has not been recorded does not come in the way of the Authorities referred to in s.48 to commence inquiry/ investigation for initiating “civil action” of “provisional attachment” of property being proceeds of crime – FIR. Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 – Enforcement Case Information Report (ECIR) – Held: Supply of a copy of ECIR in every case to the person concerned is not mandatory, it is enough if Enforcement Directorate (ED) at the time of arrest, discloses the grounds of such arrest – However, when the arrested person is produced before the Special Court, it is open to the Special Court to look into the relevant records presented by the authorised representative of ED for answering the issue of need for his/her continued detention in connection with the offence of moneylaundering. Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 – Enforcement Directorate (ED) Manual – Held: Even when ED manual is not to be published being an internal departmental document issued for the guidance of the Authorities (ED officials), the department ought to explore the desirability of placing information on its website which may broadly outline the scope of the authority of the functionaries under the Act and measures to be adopted by them as also the options/ remedies available to the person concerned before the Authority and before the Special Court. Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 – Vacancies in Appellate Tribunal – Executive to take corrective measures in this regard expeditiously. Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 – Argument about proportionality of punishment with reference to the nature of scheduled offence – Held: Is wholly unfounded.",

Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 – s.3 – Ambit of – Held: s.3 has a wider reach and captures every process and activity, direct or indirect, in dealing with the proceeds of crime and is not limited to the happening of the final act of integration of tainted property in the formal economy – Explanation inserted to s.3 by way of amendment of 2019 does not expand the purport of s.3 but is only clarificatory in nature – The expression “and” occurring in s.3 has to be construed as “or”, to give full play to the said provision so as to include “every” process or activity indulged into by anyone – The interpretation suggested, that only upon projecting or claiming the property in question as untainted property that the offence of s.3 would be complete, is rejected. Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 – Prosecution on notional basis or assumption – If permissible – Held: The Authorities under the Act cannot prosecute any person on notional basis or on the assumption that a scheduled offence has been committed, unless it is so registered with the jurisdictional police and/or pending enquiry/trial including by way of criminal complaint before the competent forum.

Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 – Enforcement Directorate (ED) Manual – Held: Even when ED manual is not to be published being an internal departmental document issued for the guidance of the Authorities (ED officials), the department ought to explore the desirability of placing information on its website which may broadly outline the scope of the authority of the functionaries under the Act and measures to be adopted by them as also the options/ remedies available to the person concerned before the Authority and before the Special Court.

Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 – Prosecution on notional basis or assumption – If permissible – Held: The Authorities under the Act cannot prosecute any person on notional basis or on the assumption that a scheduled offence has been committed, unless it is so registered with the jurisdictional police and/or pending enquiry/trial including by way of criminal complaint before the competent forum.

Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 – s.45 – Validity – The provision in the form of s.45, as applicable post amendment of 2018, is reasonable and has direct nexus with the purposes and objects sought to be achieved by the 2002 Act and does not suffer from the vice of arbitrariness or unreasonableness.

Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 – s.48 – Enforcement Case Information Report (ECIR) – Held: ECIR cannot be equated with an FIR under CrPC – ECIR is an internal document of the Enforcement Directorate (ED) – Fact that FIR in respect of scheduled offence has not been recorded does not come in the way of the Authorities referred to in s.48 to commence inquiry/ investigation for initiating “civil action” of “provisional attachment” of property being proceeds of crime – FIR. Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 – Enforcement Case Information Report (ECIR) – Held: Supply of a copy of ECIR in every case to the person concerned is not mandatory, it is enough if Enforcement Directorate (ED) at the time of arrest, discloses the grounds of such arrest – However, when the arrested person is produced before the Special Court, it is open to the Special Court to look into the relevant records presented by the authorised representative of ED for answering the issue of need for his/her continued detention in connection with the offence of moneylaundering. Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 – Enforcement Directorate (ED) Manual – Held: Even when ED manual is not to be published being an internal departmental document issued for the guidance of the Authorities (ED officials), the department ought to explore the desirability of placing information on its website which may broadly outline the scope of the authority of the functionaries under the Act and measures to be adopted by them as also the options/ remedies available to the person concerned before the Authority and before the Special Court. Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 – Vacancies in Appellate Tribunal – Executive to take corrective measures in this regard expeditiously. Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 – Argument about proportionality of punishment with reference to the nature of scheduled offence – Held: Is wholly unfounded.",
