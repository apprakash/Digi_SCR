Sub-rule (5) of r.35 makes it clearthat even in cases where direction of the Tribunal as regardsadvertisement has not been complied with, the Tribunal has an option(i) either to dismiss the petition; or (ii) to give such further directionsas it may think fit – Sub-rule (6) of r.35 confers power upon theTribunal even to dispense with any advertisement – Thus, what wasnot specifically available in black and white, under the 1956statutory regime, namely the power to dispense with anyadvertisement, is now made available specifically under the statutoryregime of 2013 – In the case at hand, the

hand, Antrix asserted thatDevas offered services which were non-existent, through a devicewhich was not available and that even the so-called intellectualproperty rights over the device were not available – Therefore, Antrixcannot lead evidence to show the non-existence or non-availabilityof those things, either by oral evidence or by subjecting their officialsto cross-examination by Devas – Devas never produced before theTribunals any device nor did they demonstrate the availability toDevas services – All that Devas wanted was, the cross-examinationof the officials of Antrix – Any amount of cross-examination of theofficials of Antrix could not have established the existence ofsomething that was disputed by Antrix – Also, it is clear from thetime-line of events that the application for cross-examination wasmoved by Devas after conclusion of the arguments on the side ofAntrix in the main petition itself, and that too after the unsuccessfulattempt made by one of its shareholders to

poppy’ exceptthe seeds – ‘Opium poppy’ defined under Clause (xvii) of s.2 of the1985 Act – As per sub-clause (a) of Clause (xvii) of s.2 of the 1985Act, ‘opium poppy’ means the plant of the species ‘papaversomniferum L’ – As per sub-clause (b) thereof, ‘opium poppy’ wouldalso mean the plant of any other species of ‘papaver’ from which‘opium’ or any ‘phenanthrene alkaloid’ can be extracted and whichthe Central Government, by notification in the official gazette, hasdeclared to be ‘opium poppy’ for the purposes of the 1985 Act –Whether it is sufficient for the prosecution to establish that the rawmaterial contains ‘morphine’ and ‘meconic acid’ to bring it undersub-clause (a) of Clause (xvii) of s.2 of the Act or is it necessary forthe prosecution to further establish that, though the seized materialcontains ‘morphine’ and ‘meconic acid’, the genus of the seizedmaterial is ‘papaver somniferum L’ or any other species of ‘papaver’from which ‘opium’ or any ‘phenanthrene alkaloid’ can be extractedand which is notified in the Official Gazette by the CentralGovernment to be ‘opium poppy’ for the purposes of the 1985 Act –High Court was of the opinion that the tests conducted by theChemical Examiner to ascertain whether ‘meconic acid’ and‘morphine’ were present in the sample stuff, were not enough toreach the conclusion that the stuff was, in fact, ‘poppy straw’ –Held: Prior to enactment of the 1985 Act, it was only the plant‘papaver somniferum L’ which was included in the definition of 1878and 1930 enactments – By virtue of sub-clause (a) of Clause (xvii)of Section 2 of the 1985 Act, the same has been retained – However,noticing that there was some material to show that some other speciesof ‘papaver’ may also be used for the production of ‘opium’, thelegislature, by an abundant precaution, also added sub-clause (b)in Clause (xvii) of s.2 of the 1985 Act so as to enable the CentralGovernment to notify such a species from which ‘opium’ or any‘phenanthrene alkaloid’ can be extracted – The legislative intent isclear that the 1985 Act, in addition to retaining the species of‘papaver somniferum L’ in the definition of ‘opium poppy’, enabledthe Central Government to include any other species of ‘papaver’from which ‘opium’ or any ‘phenanthrene alkaloid’ could beextracted – The legislative intent is to bring any other species of‘papaver’ which can be used for manufacture of ‘opium’ within theprohibitory and regulatory provisions of the 1985 Act – Once it isestablished that the seized material contains ‘meconic acid’ and‘morphine’, it will be sufficient to establish that it is derived fromthe plant ‘papaver somniferum L’ as defined in sub-clause (a) ofClause (xvii) of Section 2 of the 1985 Act – Once a ChemicalExaminer establishes that the seized ‘poppy straw’ indicates apositive test for the contents of ‘morphine’ and ‘meconic acid’, it issufficient to establish that it is covered by subclause (a) of Clause(xvii) of Section 2 of the 1985 Act and no further test would benecessary for establishing that the seized material is a part of‘papaver somniferum L’.Interpretation of Statutes – Heydon’s/Mischief Rule – Meaningof – Discussed – Four factors to be considered while applying therule (i) position before enactment of the Act (ii) mischief and defectsfor which the earlier enactments did not provide (iii) remedy (iv)reason of the remedy – Held: Legislature by incorporating sub-clause (a) in Clause (xvii) of s.2 of the 1985 Act, intended to continue‘papaver somniferum L’ in the definition of ‘opium poppy’ – However,by taking abundant precautions and to take care of a situationwhere any other species of ‘papaver’ was found to be used for theproduction of ‘opium’, the legislature vested the Central Governmentwith a power to include such a variety to mean ‘opium poppy’ forthe purpose of the 1985 Act – The defect noticed by the legislaturewas that, though ‘papaver somniferum L’, which contained‘morphine’ and ‘meconic acid’ and was used for the production of‘opium’, was already included in the definition of ‘opium’ in theearlier enactments, there was also a possibility of other variety of‘papaver’ being used for ‘opium’ production, but could not bebrought under the prohibitory and regulatory measures – The remedy,which the Parliament provided was by way of incorporating sub-clause (b) in Clause (xvii) of s.2 of the 1985 Act thereby empoweringthe Central Government to notify any other species of ‘papaver’from which ‘opium’ or any other ‘phenanthrene alkaloid’ could beextracted, to be declared as ‘opium poppy’ for the purpose of the1985 Act – The true reason for the remedy was to empower theCentral Government to include any other species of ‘papaver’ whichmay be used for the production of ‘opium’ and bring the same underthe purview of the 1985 Act – The reason was that, if it is found thatany species of ‘papaver’ is being used for the production of ‘opium’,the production of such a variety should not be permitted and thesame be brought under the prohibitory and regulatory measures asprovided under the 1985 Act – Narcotic Drugs and PsychotropicSubstances Act, 1985 – s.2(xvii) (a) and (b) –Opium Act,1878 –Dangerous Drugs Act, 1930. AInterpretation of Statutes – Purposive interpretation –Principles of – Held: Settled principle of law that an enactment hasto be incorporated in such a manner which advances the purposeof the Act rather than interpreting in such a manner which defeatsthe purpose of the Act – The dominant purpose of the Act, 1985was to curb the menace of trafficking of drugs and psychotropicsubstances – Therefore, the interpretation which advances thepurpose of the Act, 1985 has to be preferred rather than adoptinga pedantic and a mechanical approach – Narcotic Drugs andPsychotropic Substances Act, 1985",

No. 37 of 1993dated 23.03.1999, wherein it was held that a partition had beenaffected in relation to the joint family properties between the firstand second defendants and late ‘M’ in the year 1964 – Held:Partition of this property took place in the year 1964 by virtue ofan award dated 13.06.1964 passed by the panchayatdars – Thesaid document was only a memorandum of understanding/familyarrangement to be acted upon in future – The said document didnot create rights in specific properties or assets of the family, infavour of specific persons – The same did not require registrationu/s. 17 (1) (e) of the Act – Further, having regard to the fact that inthe instant case there has been no challenge to the finding ofpartition between the parties till date and the same has attainedfinality – Hence, the partition of the ancestral/joint family propertieshaving found to have taken place in the 1964 and the same havingbeen acted upon, a fresh suit for partition and separate possessionof the suit properties was not at all maintainable – The principle ofres judicata squarely applies in the present case – High Court wasjustified in affirming the judgments of the First Appellate Court aswell as the Trial Court dismissing the suit filed by the appellant-plaintiff.",

No. 37 of 1993dated 23.03.1999, wherein it was held that a partition had beenaffected in relation to the joint family properties between the firstand second defendants and late ‘M’ in the year 1964 – Held:Partition of this property took place in the year 1964 by virtue ofan award dated 13.06.1964 passed by the panchayatdars – Thesaid document was only a memorandum of understanding/familyarrangement to be acted upon in future – The said document didnot create rights in specific properties or assets of the family, infavour of specific persons – The same did not require registrationu/s. 17 (1) (e) of the Act – Further, having regard to the fact that inthe instant case there has been no challenge to the finding ofpartition between the parties till date and the same has attainedfinality – Hence, the partition of the ancestral/joint family propertieshaving found to have taken place in the 1964 and the same havingbeen acted upon, a fresh suit for partition and separate possessionof the suit properties was not at all maintainable – The principle ofres judicata squarely applies in the present case – High Court wasjustified in affirming the judgments of the First Appellate Court aswell as the Trial Court dismissing the suit filed by the appellant-plaintiff.",

UNION OF INDIA & ORS.was only clarificatory in view of the earlier observations in BuddhiPrakash Sharma – Interpreting the order to mean that the Union ofIndia sought the permission of Supreme Court before providingreservation would amount to aiding an interpretation that wouldfoster judicial overreach – The Union Government was not requiredto seek the permission of the Court before providing reservation inAIQ seats – Providing reservation in the AIQ seats is a policy decisionof the Government.Constitution of India – Reservation – All-India Quota (AIQ)seats – Impugned notice providing reservation for OBC and EWScategories in the AIQ was issued on 29 July 2021, after theregistration for the examination had closed on 18 April 2021 –Plea of the petitioners that the rules of the examination could haveonly been changed before the last date for registration and as thecandidates registered for the exam having a particular seat matrixin mind, the change in the seat matrix after registration would bearbitrary – Held: Clause 11 of the information bulletin specifiesthat the reservation applicable to NEET-PG would be notified bythe counselling authority before the beginning of the counsellingprocess – Therefore, the candidates while applying for NEET-PGare not provided any information on the distribution of seat matrix– Such information is provided by the counselling authority onlybefore the counselling session is to begin – It thus cannot be arguedthat the rules of the game were set when the registration for theexamination closed.Constitution of India – Reservation – The Constitution (OneHundred and Third Amendment) Act 2019 – Articles 15(6) and 16(6)– Criteria for the determination of the EWS for the ten percentreservation – Challenge to – Held: Challenge to the very criteriafor the determination of the EWS would not only require the matterto be heard at length but also to hear all interested parties – However,in view of the delay in the counselling process due to the pendencyof this petition, it is deemed necessary to allow the counsellingsession to begin with the existing criteria for the identification ofthe EWS category – Judicial propriety does not permit to pass aninterim order staying the criteria for determination of the EWScategory – It is a settled principle of law that in matters involvingchallenge to the constitutionality of a legislation or a rule, the Courtmust be wary to pass an interim order, unless the Court is convincedthat the rules are prima facie arbitrary – However, at this stage,without hearing all the interested parties at length on arguments, itwould be impermissible to form a prima facie opinion on the allegedarbitrariness of the criteria – Further, in the midst of the pandemic,any delay in the recruitment of doctors would impact the ability tomanage the pandemic – Hence, it is necessary to avoid any furtherdelays in the admission process and allow counselling to beginimmediately – The implementation of EWS reservation in AIQ seatsin NEET UG and PG seats for the academic year of 2021-2022 isallowed – EWS category be identified in view of the criteria in O.MNo. 36039/1/2019 – Challenge to the validity of the criteriadetermined by the Pandey Committee for the identification of theEWS category be listed for final hearing.",
