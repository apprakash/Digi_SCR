[Paras 1, 15, 16, 20] Suit \u2013 Suit for possession \u2013 Accurate description of the actual boundary or the measurements of the property \u2013 Requirement:Held: Suit for possession has to describe the property in question with accuracy and all details of measurement and boundaries \u2013 When the same is lacking, the suit for possession with respect to such a property would be liable to be dismissed on the ground of its identifiability. [Para 23] Doctrines \u2013 Doctrine of merger \u2013 Basis of: Held: Doctrine of merger is rooted in the idea of maintenance of the decorum of hierarchy of courts and tribunals \u2013 Doctrine is based on the simple reasoning that there cannot be, at the same time, more than one operative order governing the same subject matter.

[Para 12]  Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 \u2013 ss.357(1), 357-A:  Held: A victim of a crime cannot be treated merely as a prosecution witness \u2013 s.357(1) empowers the court to order that the fine amount recovered be given to any person as compensation who has suffered any loss or injury caused due to that offence \u2013 There may be times when the situation may demand that a substantive amount of compensation be paid to the victim and the convict may not be financially that strong to bear that burden \u2013 For such situations, s.357A was therefore introduced, where compensation to the victims may be paid out of State funds, as the State had the responsibility to protect the victim against the offence committed against the victim of the crime \u2013 In the present case, the victim suffered burn injuries of 45-48% and lost one leg, when he was only eighteen years of age \u2013 Rs.5,00,000/- be paid by the State to the victim as compensation u/s.357A instead of Rs.1,00,000/- as directed by the High Court.

Conviction and sentence of the appellant u/ss.302 and 201, Penal Code, 1860, if justified. Evidence Act, 1872 \u2013 s.27 \u2013 \u201cin the custody of a police officer\u201d \u2013 Interpretation \u2013 Case based on circumstantial evidence \u2013 Appellant was taken into custody during the course of investigation for the murder of his Uncle \u2013 However, he made a disclosure statement \u2013 Appellant along with other co-accused had murdered his uncle\u2019s son-deceased (appellant\u2019s cousin) who was missing for months and his body was first dumped in the sump tank and later retrieved, cut into two parts, put in sack bags, and thrown in the river/canal \u2013 Appellant subsequently arrested in the present case \u2013 On the basis of the disclosure statement, parts of the dead body and sack bags were recovered \u2013 Other articles were also recovered \u2013 Appellant\u2019s conviction and sentence u/ss.302 and 201, Penal Code, 1860, challenged: Held: The pre-requisite of police custody, within the meaning of s.27, ought to be read pragmatically and not formalistically or euphemistically \u2013 \u201ccustody\u201d u/s.27 does not mean formal custody \u2013 It includes any kind of restriction, restraint or even surveillance by the police\u2013 Even if the accused was not formally arrested at the time of giving information, the accused ought to be deemed, for all practical purposes, in the custody of the police \u2013 Words \u201cperson accused of an offence\u201d and \u201cin the custody of a police officer\u201d in s.27 are separated by a comma and thus, have to be read distinctively \u2013 The wide and pragmatic interpretation of the term \u201cpolice custody\u201d is supported by the fact that if a narrow or technical view is taken, it will be very easy for the police to delay the time of filing the FIR and arrest, and thereby evade the contours of ss.25 to 27 \u2013 A person giving word of mouth information to police, which may be used as evidence against him, may be deemed to have submitted himself to the \u201ccustody\u201d of the police officer \u2013 In the present case, the disclosure statement was made by the appellant when he was detained in another case relating to the murder of his Uncle\u2013 He was subsequently arrested in the present case \u2013 Body parts of the deceased were recovered on the pointing out of appellant in his disclosure statement \u2013 Deceased had been missing for months and was untraceable \u2013 His whereabouts were unknown\u2013 The perpetrator(s) were also unknown \u2013 It is only consequent to the disclosure statement by the appellant that the police came to know that the Deceased had been murdered \u2013 The homicidal death of Deceased, the disclosure statement and the consequent recoveries of the motorcycle and other belongings at the behest of the appellant proved beyond doubt \u2013 These facts, in the absence of any other material to doubt them, establish that the appellant committed murder of Deceased \u2013 The presence of motive, inter se family property disputes, reinforces the said conclusion \u2013 Conviction of the appellant upheld. [Paras 25, 28, 29, 31, 41] Evidence Act, 1872 \u2013 ss.25-27 \u2013 s.27, an exception to ss.25, 26 \u2013 Doctrine of confirmation by subsequent events: Held: s.27 is an exception to ss.25 and 26 \u2013 s.27 makes that part of the statement which distinctly leads to discovery of a fact in consequence of the information received from a person accused of an offence, to the extent it distinctly relates to the fact thereby discovered, admissible in evidence against the accused \u2013 The fact which is discovered as a consequence of the information given is admissible in evidence \u2013 Further, the fact discovered must lead to recovery of a physical object and only that information which distinctly relates to that discovery can be proved \u2013 s.27 is based on the doctrine of confirmation by subsequent events- a fact is actually discovered in consequence of the information given, which results in recovery of a physical object \u2013 The facts discovered and the recovery is an assurance that the information given by a person accused of the offence can be relied \u2013 However, s.27 does not lay down the principle that discovery of a fact is to be equated to the object produced or found. [Paras 19, 22]  Evidence Act, 1872 \u2013 s.27 \u2013 Conditions necessary for bringing s.27 into operation, discussed \u2013 Facts proved by the prosecution \u2013 Duty of the Court \u2013 Evidence produced in terms of s.27 \u2013 Evidentiary value: Held: The facts proved by the prosecution, particularly the admissible portion of the statement of the accused, would give rise to two alternative hypotheses, (i) that the accused had himself deposited the physical items which were recovered; or (ii) only the accused knew that the physical items were lying at that place \u2013 The second hypothesis is wholly compatible with the innocence of the accused, whereas the first would be a factor to show involvement of the accused in the offence \u2013 The court has to analyse which of the hypotheses should be accepted in a particular case \u2013 s.27 is frequently used by the police, and the courts must be vigilant about its application to ensure credibility of evidence, as the provision is vulnerable to abuse \u2013 However, this does not mean that in every case invocation of s.27 must be seen with suspicion and is to be discarded as perfunctory and unworthy of credence \u2013 Evidentiary value to be attached on evidence produced before the court in terms of s.27 cannot be codified or put in a straightjacket formula \u2013 It depends upon the facts and circumstances of the case \u2013 A holistic and inferential appreciation of evidence is required to be adopted in a case of circumstantial evidence. [Paras 23, 24] Evidence Act, 1872\u2013 ss.24-27 \u2013 \u201caccused person\u201d, \u201ca person accused of any offence\u201d: Held: The bar u/s.25 applies equally whether or not the person against whom evidence is sought to be led in a criminal trial was in custody at the time of making the confession \u2013 For the ban to be effective the person need not have been accused of an offence when he made the confession \u2013 The reason is that the expression \u201caccused person\u201d in s.24 and the expression \u201ca person accused of any offence\u201d in ss.26 and 27 have the same connotation, and describe the person against whom evidence is sought to be led in a criminal proceeding \u2013 The adjectival clause \u201caccused of any offence\u201d is, therefore, descriptive of the person against whom a confessional statement made by him is declared not provable, and does not predicate a condition of that person at the time of making the statement. [Para 26] Criminal Law \u2013 Appellant was accused of the murder of his Uncle and his son \u2013 Acquitted in the case relating to the murder of Uncle \u2013 Judgment of acquittal \u2013 Evidentiary value, if any: Held: Except for the fact that the appellant was taken into custody during the course of investigation for the murder of his Uncle and thereupon his disclosure statement (Exhibit P-37) was recorded, there is no connection between the two offences \u2013 Murders were committed on two different dates \u2013 Murder trial of his Uncle was primarily based upon an entirely different set of evidence \u2013 Conviction of the appellant is sustainable in view of the evidence placed on record in the present case \u2013 The judgment of acquittal would not qualify as relevant and of evidentiary value so as to acquit the appellant in the present case. [Para 42] Evidence Act, 1872 \u2013 s.27 \u2013 Disclosure statement (Exhibit P-37) made by the appellant, convicted \u2013 Acquittal of the coaccused \u2013 Application of s.27: Held: Acquittal of the co-accused was for want of evidence against them \u2013 At best, they were found in possession of the articles connected with the crime on the basis of the disclosure statement (Exhibit P-37) made by the appellant \u2013 s.27 of the Evidence Act could not have been applied to the other co-accused as the provision pertains to information that distinctly relates to the discovery of a \u2018fact\u2019 that was previously unknown, as opposed to fact already disclosed or known \u2013 Once information is given by an accused, the same information cannot be used, even if voluntarily made by a co-accused who is in custody \u2013 s.27 does apply to joint disclosures, but this is not one such case \u2013 This was precisely the reason given by the trial court to acquit the co-accused \u2013 Further, even if Section 8 of the Evidence Act was to apply, it would not have been possible to convict the co-accused \u2013 The trial court rightly held other co-accused not guilty. [Para 43] Evidence \u2013 Case based on circumstantial evidence \u2013 Five golden principles to be satisfied as laid down in Sharad Birdhichand Sarda v. State of Maharashtra [1985] 1 SCR 88 \u2013 Conditions to be fulfilled before the false explanation or a false defence can be used by the Court as an additional link to lend an assurance to the court, stated \u2013 A distinction has to be drawn between incomplete chain of circumstances and a circumstance after a chain is complete and the defence or explanation given by the accused is found to be false, in which event the said falsehood is added to reinforce the conclusion of the court. [Paras 37, 38] Evidence Act, 1872 \u2013 s.106 \u2013 Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 \u2013 s.313: Held: Appellant in his statement u/s.313 denied all accusations without furnishing any explanation regarding his knowledge of the places from which the dead body was recovered \u2013 The failure of the appellant to present evidence on his behalf or to offer any cogent explanation regarding the recovery of the dead body by virtue of his special knowledge must lead to a reasonable adverse inference, by application of the principle u/s.106 of the Evidence Act thus forming an additional link in the chain of circumstances \u2013 The additional link further affirms the conclusion of guilt as indicated by the prosecution evidence. [Para 40] Words and Phrases \u2013 \u2018distinctly\u2019 in s.27, Evidence Act, 1872: Held: The word \u2018distinctly\u2019 is used to limit and define the scope of the information and means \u2018directly\u2019, \u2018indubitably\u2019, \u2018strictly\u2019 or \u2018unmistakably\u2019 \u2013 Only that part of the information which is clear, immediate and a proximate cause of discovery is admissible.

Amit Metaliks Limited & Another [2021] 6 SCR 611, which is in discord with the ratio decidendi of the decisions of the three Judge Bench in Committee of Creditors of Essar Steel India Limited v.

[Para 12] Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 \u2013 Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India (Liquidation Process) Regulations, 2016 \u2013 Regn. 29 \u2013 Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 \u2013 Or. VIII, r.6 \u2013 Application of the Provisions of statutory set-off to Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process: Held: The provisions of statutory set-off in terms of Or. VIII, r. 6 of CPC or insolvency set-off as permitted by Regulation 29 of the Liquidation Regulations cannot be applied to the Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process \u2013 The aforesaid rule would be, however, subject to two exceptions or situations \u2013 The first, if at all it can be called an exception, is where a party is entitled to contractual set-off, on the date which is effective before or on the date the Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process is put into motion or commences \u2013 The reason is simple \u2013 The Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process does not preclude application of contractual set-off \u2013 The second exception will be in the case of \u2018equitable set-off\u2019 when the claim and counter claim in the form of set-off are linked and connected on account of one or more transactions that can be treated as one \u2013 The set-off should be genuine and clearly established on facts and in law, so as to make it inequitable and unfair that the debtor be asked to pay money, without adjustment sought that is fully justified and legal \u2013 The amount to be adjusted should be a quantifiable and unquestionable monetary claim, as the Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process is a time-bound summary procedure. [Paras 30 and 32] Words and Phrases \u2013 Set-off \u2013 Meaning of: Held: Set-off in generic sense recognises the right of a debtor to adjust the smaller claim owed to him against the larger claim payable to his creditor \u2013 Set-off is given legal preference for three reasons \u2013 First, in economic terms, set-off is a form of security recognised in law \u2013 It is, however, not a security in a strict sense, but a right that enhances provision of credit and acts as a stimulus to trade and commerce by giving a degree of confidence to parties dealing with each other \u2013 Secondly, it helps reduce litigation, promotes economy of time and is an efficient method in resolving debt between parties \u2013 Thirdly, natural equity requires that crossdemands should compensate each other by deducting the lesser sum from the greater \u2013 At least five different meanings can be ascribed to the term \u2018set-off\u2019, namely, (a) statutory or legal set-off; (b) common law set-off; (c) equitable set-off; (d) contractual set-off; and (e) insolvency set-off. [Paras 3, 4 and 5] Words and Phrases \u2013 Contractual set-off \u2013 Meaning of: Held: Contractual set-off is a matter of agreement, rather than a separate application of set-off \u2013 The parties are free to mutually agree on the outcomes they desire \u2013 Being consensual, when expressly stated, the normal rules of set-off regarding mutuality of credits or debts, liquid debts, and connected debts-aspects relevant and noticed below while dealing with statutory/legal set-offs or even insolvency set-off - may not apply \u2013 The contract, however, should be within bounds of legality and public policy \u2013 Further, the normal requirements of the law of contracts, viz. intention to create legal relationship, acceptance, consideration etc. should be established for a valid contractual set-off \u2013 Ascertaining the applicability of contractual set-off requires an assessment of the understanding whether the right is conferred by the agreement, as the court gives effect to the intention of the parties as to how they should deal \u2013 The right to set-off may be explicit in the words of the agreement, or can be gathered by existence of oral or implied agreement to set-off, reflecting an understanding to the said effect. [Paras 6 and 7] Words and Phrases \u2013 Statutory or legal set-off: Held: Statutory or legal set-off is created by a statute \u2013 For example, Order VIII Rule 6 of the CPC states that where a suit for recovery of money is filed, the defendant can claim set-off against the plaintiff\u2019s demand for any ascertained sum of money legally recoverable by the defendant from the plaintiff, but not exceeding the pecuniary limits of the jurisdiction of the court \u2013 It requires that both the parties should fill the same character as they fill in the plaintiff\u2019s suit. [Para 8] Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India (Liquidation Process) Regulations, 2016 \u2013 Regn. 29 \u2013 Mutual dealings: Held: The expression \u2018mutual dealings\u2019 for the purpose of Regulation 29 of the Liquidation Regulations, is wider than the statutory set-off postulated under Order VIII Rule 6 of CPC, as well as, equitable set-off under the common law as applicable in India \u2013 Insolvency set-off applies when demands are between the same parties \u2013 There must be commonality of identity between the person who has made the claim and the person against whom the claim exists \u2013 Even when there are several distinct and independent transactions, mutuality can exist between the same parties functioning in the same right or capacity \u2013 Mutual dealings are not so much concerned with the nature of the claims, but with the relationship and apposite identity of the parties giving rise to the respective claims, such that it would offend one\u2019s sense of fairness or justice to allow one to be enforced without regard to the other.

[Paras 17 ] Constitution of India \u2013 Art. 32 \u2013 Investigation conducted by SEBI into the allegations that the Adani group manipulated its share prices and failed to disclose transactions with elated parties and other information in violation of the SEBI regulations \u2013 Regulatory failure, if attributable to SEBI: Held: No reason to interfere with the regulations made by SEBI in the exercise of its delegated legislative powers \u2013 SEBI has traced the evolution of its regulatory framework, and explained the reasons for the changes in its regulations \u2013 Procedure followed in arriving at the current shape of the regulations is not tainted with any illegality \u2013 There are no submissions that the regulations are unreasonable, capricious, arbitrary, or violative of the Constitution \u2013 Petitioners have not challenged the vires of the Regulations but have contended that there is regulatory failure based on SEBI\u2019s alleged inability to investigate which is attributed to changes in the regulations \u2013 Such a ground is unknown to this Court\u2019s jurisprudence \u2013 Critique of the regulations made as an afterthought and based on a value judgment of economic policy is impermissible \u2013 Prayer seeking directions to SEBI to revoke its amendments to the FPI Regulations and LODR Regulations must fail \u2013 No valid grounds have been raised for this Court to direct SEBI to revoke its amendments to the FPI Regulations and the LODR Regulations which were made in exercise of its delegated legislative power \u2013 Thus, the procedure followed in arriving at the current shape of the regulations does not suffer from irregularity or illegality \u2013 FPI Regulations and LODR Regulations have been tightened by the amendments in question. [Para 28, 29, 30, 67c] Constitution of India \u2013 Arts. 32 and 142 \u2013 Transfer of the investigation from SEBI to another agency or to SIT \u2013 Power of: Held: Court does have the power u/Art. 32 and 142 to transfer an investigation from the authorized agency to the CBI or constitute an SIT \u2013 However, such powers must be exercised sparingly and in extraordinary circumstances \u2013 Unless the authority statutorily entrusted with the power to investigate portrays a glaring, willful and deliberate inaction in carrying out the investigation, the court will ordinarily not supplant the authority which has been vested with the power to investigate \u2013 Such powers must not be exercised by the court in the absence of cogent justification indicative of a likely failure of justice in the absence of the exercise of the power to transfer \u2013 Petitioner must place on record strong evidence indicating that the investigating agency has portrayed inadequacy in investigation or prima facie appears to be biased.[Para 32] Constitution of India \u2013 Arts. 32 \u2013 Investigation \u2013 Comprehensive investigation conducted by SEBI into the allegations that the Adani group manipulated its share prices and failed to disclose transactions with related parties: Held: Out of the twenty-four investigations carried out by SEBI, twenty-two are concluded \u2013 Twenty-two final investigation reports and one interim investigation report have been approved by the competent authority under SEBI\u2019s procedures \u2013 As regards the delay of only ten days in filing the report, such a delay does not prima facie indicate deliberate inaction by SEBI, when the issue involved a complex investigation in coordination with various agencies, both domestic and foreign \u2013 No apparent regulatory failure can be attributed to SEBI based on the material before this Court \u2013 Thus, prima facie no deliberate inaction or inadequacy in the investigation by SEBI.

Constitution of India \u2013 Arts. 32 \u2013 Investigation conducted by SEBI into the allegations levelled against the Adani group \u2013 Adequacy of SEBI\u2019s investigation \u2013 Challange to \u2013 Reliance on the OCCRP report of a third-party organization and the letter by DRI: Held: Reliance on newspaper articles or reports by third-party organizations to question a comprehensive investigation by a specialized regulator does not inspire confidence \u2013 Such reports by \u201cindependent\u201d groups or investigative pieces by newspapers may act as inputs before SEBI or the Expert Committee \u2013 However, they cannot be relied on as conclusive proof of the inadequacy of the investigation by SEBI nor, can such inputs be regarded as \u201ccredible evidence\u201d \u2013 Also the petitioner\u2019s assertion that SEBI was lackadaisical in its investigation is not borne out from the reference to the letter sent by the DRI. [Paras 40, 43] Shares and securities \u2013 Short selling \u2013 Meaning of: Held: Short selling is a sale of securities which the seller does not own but borrows from another entity, with the hope of repurchasing them at a later date with a lower price, thus, attempting to profit from an anticipated decline in the price of the securities \u2013 In its report, Hindenburg Research admits to taking a short position in the Adani group through US-traded bonds and non-Indian traded derivative instruments \u2013 SEBI has submitted that short selling is a desirable and essential feature to provide liquidity and to help price correction in over-valued stocks and hence, short selling is recognised as a legitimate investment activity by securities market regulators in most countries \u2013 Short selling is regulated by a circular notified by SEBI on 20 December 2007 \u2013 Any restrictions on short selling, may distort efficient price discovery, provide promoters unfettered freedom to manipulate prices, and favour manipulators rather than rational investors \u2013 Thus, the International Organisation of Securities Commission recommends that short selling be regulated but not prohibited with an aim to increase transparency \u2013 Measures to regulate short selling will be considered by the Government of India and SEBI. [Para 58] Constitution of India \u2013 Arts. 32 \u2013 Public interest jurisprudence under \u2013 Scope of: Held: It was expanded by this Court to secure access to justice and provide ordinary citizens with the opportunity to highlight legitimate causes before this Court \u2013 It has served as a tool to secure justice and ensure accountability on many occasions, where ordinary citizens have approached the Court with well-researched petitions that highlight a clear cause of action \u2013 However, petitions that lack adequate research and rely on unverified and unrelated material tend to, in fact, be counterproductive \u2013 This word of caution must be kept in mind by lawyers and members of civil society alike. [Para 68] Constitution of India \u2013 Arts. 32 \u2013 Allegations that the Adani group manipulated its share prices and failed to disclose transactions with related parties \u2013 Recommendations of the Expert Committee to strengthen regulatory framework and secure compliance to protect investors \u2013 Elucidated.
